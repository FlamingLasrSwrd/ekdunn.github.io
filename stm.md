This is a collection of all the things my short term memory is unable to adequately assimilate.

# TODO

- Migrate the rest of old site and past projects.

# Lead Dioxide Anode

## Lead Nitrate Synthesis

- 255g lead metal
- unknown quantity of dilute HNO_3

# Star San Replacement

$25 - 32 oz. Star San -> 0.945 L -> (1.335 kg/L) -> 1.26 kg -> 0.63 kg H3PO4 = $39/kg H3PO4

## Original Recipe

- 50% phosphoric acid
- 15% Dodecylbenzene Sulfonic Acid (surfactant)
- 10% isopropyl alcohol
- other - trade secret

## 1st Level Purchase

eBay - phosphoric acid 85% 1 gal $50 (1.685 kg/l) -> 6.37 kg -> 5.4 kg H3PO4 = $9.2/kg H3PO4

## Burning Phosphorus

P4 + 5O2 -> P4O10

P4O1O + 6H2O -> 4 H3PO4

For 1kg H3PO4: -> (98 g/mol) -> 10.2 mol -> 2.6 mol P -> (30 g/mol) -> 77g P From matchbooks -> 0.03g/box -> 2600 boxes!

# Formalin Synthesis
