## 05 Jul 2019
Started drying the copper chloride solution. For weeks now it has been sitting in my fume hood. I bubbled ozone through muriatic acid and copper to create copper (II) chloride. I'm hoping to use this to make anhydrous aluminum chloride by single displacement.

## 04 Jul 2019
Lots and lots of cleaning/organization.

## 03 Jul 2019
It's really difficult to fit all my projects into a 12'x12' room and a tiny storage shed...

## 02 Jul 2019
The last few weeks have been exhausting: Wedding, MVOR, Guatemala trip, MINK. Now back to science...

I have been reading about the history of psychedelics research because of their resurgence in treating mental disorders. I think there is ample opportunity here for someone to translate the science into effective treatment on Youtube or other social media platform. I bet a channel devoted to illustrating (but not actually performing) the chemical reactions needed for synthesis of these drugs would be very popular. Unfortunately, Youtube would likely demonetize any such channel.

Working on vapor phase nitration of paraffins. Seems like a refluxing system I had in mind will return the nitropropanes as well as nitric acid. I think I will have to do a single pass system, which would be wasteful. Perhaps nitrogen dioxide would be better?

Glidarc atmospheric nitrogen fixation: Finally got my big flyback from home. Tomorrow I will give it a test with the ZVS driver I bought on eBay. The idea is to build something similar to [@patil_plasma_2016]. I'm debating whether to just go with the simple Jacob's ladder design that has been done by a few amateurs. I also want to try adding a DBD ozone generator immediately following the Glidarc chamber. I believe the ozone will help oxidize the nitric oxide.

One important point of the Patil et al. paper is that frequency is important for Glidarc efficiency. Every amateur build of a plasma nitrogen fixation apparatus has used low frequency (60 hertz) transformers. The paper found the highest energy efficiency at 8 kHz; the middle of their test range. I am not sure what the typical frequency of a flyback is, but it is probably better than 60.

5+5 is the typical winding configuration for the primary on flyback transformers.

## 15 Jun 2019
Finally ready to test the DES Ethaline (2:1 ethylene glycol:choline chloride) for some organic transformations. First test: decarboxylation of Vitamin B3 (Niacin) to pyridine. I decided on using basic copper carbonate because of availability. I'm hoping that the reaction will proceed faster and give better yields than traditional destructive distillation (32%) or the best amateur catalytic prep using copper chromite (86%) [@dougslab_pyridine_2015].

To a 250ml flask:

- 25g niacin
- 6g basic copper carbonate
- ~150ml ethaline

Heat flask to 50C to start decomposition. Obvious evolution of carbon dioxide happening. Stir bar broke free after about 10 minutes of heating. Continued ramping up the heat. At heating mantle set at 210C, significant distillation occurred at still temp starting at 56C. The mixture is at approximately 135C.

I should have analyzed the expected return of pyridine before I started. Quantitative yield would be ~16g pyridine. I was so disappointed when I only recovered about 15ml even though this is close to quantitative. I hope to do a scaled up version in the future. A copper chromite catalyst might speed the reaction.

## 14 Jun 2019
Performed a test run of the NMP distillation from the old CitriStrip.

- Dilute CitriStrip with same volume of distilled water
- stir for several minutes to ensure all NMP is dissolved in the water
- filter through glass or polyester fiber (slow process)
- let settle overnight
- filter again through filter paper or cotton
- distill under vacuum (water aspirator distills NMP at ~150C)

## 12 Jun 2019
I call the Liqiud Creosote test a bust: It is too dilute to be useful.

## 11 Jun 2019
Currently running a distillation of the Meeco's Red Devil Liquid Creosote destroyer attempting to recover "acetic acid glacial". It is not looking good. Of a total 600ml, 50-100ml distilled below 100C. I am still collecting at 100C.

## 10 Jun 2019
Worked on the strawberry wine project.

## 06 Jun 2019
Finished construction of a TA4 snr based temperature controller. I needed something that was more accurate than my other Rex C-100 based one. I also bought a Pt100 RTD probe for more accurate readings. The autotune function on the TA4 is really nice.

## 28 May 2019
Applied single-part epoxy to the inside of the fume hood.

Put a magic eraser wrapped in foil in the oven at 500F too see if that was sufficient temperature to carburize it... it is not.

## 27 May 2019

Finally started rebuilding the fume hood. It is hard to rebuild when you barely have room to walk let alone rotate several 2'x4' MDF boards around.

Next time I am buying all my building materials from Home Depot. The Menards boards were up to 1/4" off dimension and several degrees out of square. They gave me a lot of trouble: Not worth a few dollars in savings.

I did, however, manage to stumble upon a potential source of glacial acetic acid. "Meeco Liquid Creosote Remover" has "acetic acid, glacial" listed as its only ingredient. I can't find a SDS anywhere. I will run some tests to make sure when my fume hood is functional again. It was only $10 for a quart.

I'm not excited about the loudness of my exhaust fan. I am currently using a permanent magnet leaf blower driven with a standard dimmer. This is convenient because I can adjust the speed to match the danger of the experiment. It can really move some air. Unfortunately, the designers of leaf blowers aren't too concerned about loudness.

## 25 May 2019

How about we mix plaster of paris with vermiculite to form a castable, insulating refractory? It seems that calcium sulfate (anhydrite) decomposes above 1200C [@newman_behavior_1941]. This is perfect for use with vermiculite which decomposes at around 1100C.

Mixed a test batch of verm:plaster insulating refractory. 500ml verm + 250ml water (mixed) + 500 ml plaster. I added to my greased 4x8 inch mold and let it set for 1 hr before dislodging and drying in the oven at 350 for 1hr. It only formed a 1" thick brick but it seems pretty stable. The plaster I used is a mix of calcium sulfate, carbonate, and silica. If these bricks hold up, I will try it with a more pure product.

Apparently the reason for the DIY refractory community abstaining from vermiculite is that it "absorbs water and when heated will crack the refractory". I'm not sure where this idea came from. Perhaps [backyard metalcasting](http://www.backyardmetalcasting.com/refractories.html)? The author states that vermiculite is added to potting soil to retain moisture and this makes it unsuitable for refractories. This doesn't mean it is hygroscopic. Perlite has about half to two-thirds the water holding capacity of vermiculite but it isn't zero [keensteading](https://www.keensteading.com/perlite-vs-vermiculite/). As with any water based refractory, a burnout period is required before use. I suppose we will just have to see how it holds up.

## 24 May 2019
I woke up this morning at 6am, unable to return back to sleep because of back pain. I need to fix this bed thing.

I have been neglecting my sleep for a long time now mostly because of cost. Why would I spend $500 on a mattress when I can buy and air mattress for $10? My back... that's why.

I looked into ordering a mattress from Leesa primarily because I want to support one of the many creators I listen to/watch. The Skeptics Guide has a 25% off advert deal with Leesa so I tried there first. For a full sized mattress it was approximately $650. Not too bad, but more than I would like. I'll find something cheaper and just donate them the money.

All of the mattress companies have diagrams depicting their various layers and features displayed proudly on their sites. They all seem to just be various densities of foam stacked upon one another. A cooling layer here. A support layer there. Meh... why don't I just build my own.

Amazon has cheap mattress toppers available from 1-4 inches of many densities and materials. I'm a side sleeper and I get really hot at night. Especially when my significant other sleeps over. So I ended up buying a 3" latex foam and a 2" memory foam set. I'm not sure in which order I will put them, though.

One project I have had in the back of my mind for years now is a water cooled bed.

## 22 May 2019
Perhaps it is better to work at a small scale: shake flask culture.

- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2983846

How about we use one-half of a disposable syringe filter for the bubbler? They already have appropriate sizes and are autoclavable... **Nope: the filter material is thin and impossible to extract without damage.**

Just bought ~$60 worth of wood to rebuild the fume hood. Half inch and three-quarter inch MDF for the walls and some eighth inch hardiboard for baffles. I plan on painting everything with some white single part epoxy I have and then sealing edges with silicone. LED lights would be nice.

## 21 May 2019
Looking into lab-scale bioreactor builds.

- aeration: only SS brewing and alumina aerators are autoclavable
- https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/open-bioeconomy-lab/microbial-bioreactor-d7f61b
- https://sites.google.com/site/opensourcebioreactor/

I really need to organize my projects better. I have 20ish going on right now and most of them are primarily in my head.

## 19 May 2019
Finished (mostly) the lofted bed frame. Attached a clothes hanger bar to the underside. Works quite well.

## 18 May 2019
I am practically useless if I take bacopa extract in the morning without breakfast. I assume that the same would happen with any supplement that is supposed to be taken with food.

I am currently constructing a bed loft. It shouldn't be that difficult but I keep making simple mistakes. Drilling holes in the wrong place. Making cuts on the wrong side of the line. Just stupid stuff.

"Magic Erasers" are made from melamine foam. Carburization after inpregnation with graphene oxide would be fun to do. [@tjandra_melamine_2018]

I have been researching plasma nitrogen fixation as a source of nitric acid for the amateur for a while now ([nitric acid collection on Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/ekdunn/items/collectionKey/DBGV3U9D)). A new method got my attention: photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using carbon nitride/metal oxide composites [@mou_one-step_2019]. The process uses a DES composed of urea, melamine, and metal chlorides. The urea-melamine DES is capable of dissolving the metals quite effectively. Carburization produces a homogeneous carbon nitride/metal oxide catalyst that shows remarkable efficiency in photocatalytic ammonia production.

## 29 Apr 2019
Perchlorate electrolysis research. Lead dioxide or glassy carbon anodes?

- seems like glassy carbon can be made from just about any carbon polymer [@pocard_doped_1992]
- perhaps a thin coating of some resin (e.g. urethane) onto gouging rods and vacuum pyrolysis to form a glassy carbon coated graphite rod?

## 06 Apr 2019
Researching truffle production. A summary of the info I have gathered so far:

Black truffles (Tuber melanosporum) can sell for $800-$3000 per pound. A single acre of oak or hazlenut trees can produce 25-150 lbs per year. That's $20,000-$450,000 per acre per year. Maturation of a plantation takes 5-10 years. One particular site claims closer to 3 years to first harvest. A single stand can produce for 50+ years if properly managed. Infection by competing fungi seems to be a major killer of plantations. As many as half of startup plantations fail due to owner negligence or giving up. Infected seedlings can be purchased for $25-$75 each. Around 200 trees are required per acre. This is $5000-$15,000 per acre startup. Plus the cost of fertilization and application of agricultural lime (truffles life basic soil). I would prefer a method that doesn't require so much startup capital.

Irrigation might be necessary. As will protection from freezing. Extended freezing temperatures could kill the truffles. Irrigation can be done only over the burn spots produced by developing fungi to reduce water usage.

Significant infection by competing fungi can occur by placing a truffle plantation in close proximity to established tree stands.

Perhaps I can do the inoculations myself. A company in the UK sells 100g sachets of truffle spore compost, which supposedly can be dumped around the roots of a tree to infect it. I wonder if I can buy a fresh truffle and extract the spores myself. Agar cultivation appears out of the question. Truffle mycelia require tree roots to propagate.

So I have a couple options. I can buy just a few infected trees and hope they can infect other trees by proximity alone. I can take a chance on the spore sachets. Spores can be obtained by crushing truffles directly.

## 31 Mar 2019
Mixed up a batch of choline chloride: zinc chloride DES. 1:1 molar ratio roughly (48g ChCl + 45g ZnCl2). ChCl is deliquescent and my container was apparently quite porous, so it was pretty wet. This made approximately 75ml. [@bagh_ionic_2014] uses ratios 1:1 to 1:3 so I'm not too worried about exact numbers.

## 11 Mar 2019
I will be away from home for about two weeks and unable to work on any projects. Gotta make that money...

## 03 Mar 2019
Racked the strawberry wine today. Gave it a taste test as well. Pretty good... Still carbonated a bit, but tasty nonetheless.

Finally settled on LEDs for a grow light.


## 28 Feb 2019
Day 3 of acetic acid distillation. Recovered an additional 110ml water. All of this work for 15g of glacial acetic acid??

## 27 Feb 2019
Day 2 of acetic acid distillation. Recovered about 120ml of water from the system. It took almost 10 hours of distillation to get that much. I started with 300ml of 5% acetic acid.

I watched a video just now on [Why FYRE Was Never Real - Wisecrack Vlog](https://youtu.be/ASoaHKRGXu4). I had no idea that there are people whose main purpose in life is to take Instagram photos and share them. I can understand those who garner followers to attract advertisers and the income that they bring. But fame for fame's sake? What does that even do for you? I suppose I am too much of a pragmatist.

Made a hydroponic herb garden today from parts around my house. It uses a small fountain pump to move water from the reservoir at the bottom of the bucket to the three restricted drip emitters. The media is 25:75 vermiculite:coco coir.

![Hydroponic herb garden]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/20190227_175450.jpg)

I had some trouble with the first drip emitters. I used a circular length of polypropylene tubing with holes poked in it. Of course the holes got plugged. Even after rinsing the media several times and wrapping the pump in several layers of polyfill stuffing. So I switched to drip emitters.

Looking into plastic as a viable column packing material for low temperature distillation. Polypropylene seems an acceptable choice for ethanol:water mixtures [@adogbo_performance_2013]. Nylon is also resistant to ethanol and has an appropriately high boiling point. Both plastics can be bought as small tubing and cut into "raschig" rings. Nylon absorbs water though. Plastics probably wouldn't transfer heat a well as most other materials. Considering you can buy a pound of ceramic raschig rings on eBay for $14, or just use stainless scrub pads this doesn't seem worth it.

## 26 Feb 2019
Today I would like to look into a minimal cost, nutritionally complete diet.

Food replacements (e.g. Soylent, Huel) are a possibility, or rather their [DIY counterparts](https://www.completefoods.com).

Constructed a makeshift dean-stark trap using basic glassware and round bottom flask with a distillation arm. My fume hood isn't tall enough to incorporate the whole setup, so it is sitting in front. Since this is only ethyl acetate, water, and acetic acid, I don't need much in the way of fume0 extraction. Also, the temperature controller box is working perfectly.

Diethyl ether might make a better drying agent, but I don't want to deal with the hazards associated with it.

The whole process takes a long time to complete. I anticipate several days for a full gallon jug to yield approximately 180g of glacial acetic acid. Just a guess... about $0.75 for the electricity and ~$5 for the gallon of vinegar = $120 per gallon. That doesn't include the time invested or any inevitable losses of ethyl acetate or vinegar. Glacial acetic acid routinely sells for ~$50 per gallon on eBay. Obviously not the most economical. Once running, the system requires very little intervention. Just emptying the water trap and refilling the boiling flask with new dilute acid ever few hours.

Alternatively, one could use calcium chloride to cause an equilibrium inversion and distill out the acetic acid directly [@garwin_separation_1950]. A huge number of theoretical plates is necessary though. At 60% concentration of calcium chloride, it might be possible to distill the vinegar using my equipment. It would still require something like 20 plates. 304 Stainless isn't good enough for high concentration acetic acid (316 is fine). Maybe a diy spinning band column using magnetic bearings at the bottom...

The relative volatility of regular acetic acid:water at 5% concetration is something like 1.01 and you would have to distill all that water first. That requires hundreds of plates and a lot of time. With 60% CaCl2, its close to 1.61 requiring 15ish plates. [@berg_dehydration_1992] Still... you would lose a lot of acetic acid.

Best just to buy sodium acetate and distill over sulfuric acid.


## 25 Feb 2019
Experimenting with ethyl acetate as an azeotropic drying agent for dilute acetic acid.
![Ethyl acetate - water - acetic acid distillation]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/20190225_160218.jpg)

Works well enough for a single pass. Now I just need a dean-stark trap...

Column packing material: apparently glass beads don't have enough surface area. Many people use stainless steel scrubbing pads, but those aren't entirely inert. Cutting slices from pipettes is too labor intensive.

## 21 Feb 2019
Made a PID temperature controller box today for about $20.
![PID temperature controller box]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/20190221_193202.jpg)

Made from a cheap [Rex C-100 PID controller from China](https://www.ebay.com/p/Rex-c100-Digital-PID-Temperature-Controller-Regulator-K-Thermocouple-40a-SSR-H5/6018107649) and a GFI outlet. Those PID regulators come with a 40A SSR and a thermocouple. For $15 you really can't beat it. The box is from an old computer power supply. I used a receptacle instead of hard wiring so I can use it for all kinds of equipment. From sous vide to lab furnace. I even bought a second controller for additional devices if I need it.

## 12 Dec 2018
I've been bingeing Stargate Atlantis lately and I've noticed one thing in particular. Every member of the Atlantis team has one job and one job only (apart from support staff). They don't have to worry about making food or paying for medical care. They don't have to worry about the majority of cleaning including their clothing. They wear practically the same thing everyday and it is expected of them to do so. Everything apart from the problems in their respective fields is completely taken care of. I wish I had the means to make that happen for myself. Even better would be to have to means to provide that for the entire human race. Maybe this is why I am drawn to being one of the first to colonize mars.

### Crypto bot trading
The problem is invariance. Every AI/bot trader I have seen used static prices and maybe some technical indicators to train. But a stock price isn't based on whether its $300 or $3 (except in a categorical penny stock vs. blue chip sort of way, but that data is included in the volatility). What I'm talking about is the same mechanism by which a person recognizes the same graphical trend between stocks and over time (e.g., resistance levels). Or put another way, the absolute number of seconds since the epoch doesn't matter, but the day of the week certainly does. The key is finding the appropriate invariant parameters, or better yet creating an AI that can. Since the latter has been the subject of research for decades and not likely to be solved quickly, I am forced to stick to the former.

Some of the more advanced crypto bots use the order book which can be useful. An interesting technique is to determine the total number of new book orders placed per unit time. That might be incorporated.

When a trader looks at a chart, what do they see?

- up/down trends
      - is the current price above or below the price(s) of the last time period
- what did the stock do at this previous price? (resistance level)

How to format data input to be invariant?

- prices are not based on absolute values
      - inputs should be percent change from the previous time period(s)
      - time periods should scale: kind of like a fractal, self-similar on many levels

Hard coding some day trading strategies?
E.g. resistance level:

- locate similar prices in the historical data
- determine if support or resistance level
- if support: predict a bull market
- if resistance: predict a bear market

I envision a network of regions that each have a prediction on future prices. Output: [(price1, time_delta1, certainty1),(price2, time_delta2, certainty2),...]. Alternatively, the output can be (price_delta1, time_delta1, certainty1). The predictions are combined based on their certainties and orders executed appropriately. Regions can be intermixed, but that may be more complicated than necessary at the moment. A region can be as simple as extrapolation from the EMAs or as complex as a whole deep learning AI. The regions are curated based on performance and replaced as necessary.

Instead of prices, the input will look like [+0.23,-0.1,-0.15,...]. Basically a price delta.

## 12 Nov 2018
- Started to get back into using Anki more effectively
- I would love to build a anki app that organizes cards based on classes and functions:
      - a function is a card set which certain aspects can be modified, but the card serves the same purpose
        - e.g. learning how to add: 5+5=10 is the same *function* as 3+6=9
          - the numbers don't matter; only the function
        - only a single card is presented to check if a function is known
        - the next presentation of a function is a different card from the set
        - cards can be generated on demand if the function is something a computer can deduce
          - works for the function *add* but doesn't work for *plural form of the word:*
      - a class...

**Note**: upon further reflection, this sort of thing will naturally sort itself out by virtue of the rating system. If a card is easy to remember because it is based on a shared function, the user can simply rate it as *easy to remember*.

## 28 Oct 2018
- Elijah's Quick Whiskey turned out ok
      - the color was a deep red-brown; darker than most whiskeys
      - the taste was acceptable; it was still 40% ethanol...
      - I don't have much to compare it to, since I've never drank from a bottle of whiskey that costs more than $20
- I would like to build a large food dehydrator...

## 25 Oct 2018
- attempted the first test of quick aged whiskey yesterday
    - 720 ml 40% alcohol from sugar wash
      - previously used ozonolysis, carbon filtration, [@shinnosuke_onuki_purification_2007] and 4x distillation to purify
      - made sure to remove 10ml of the head to limit methanol
      - mixed 300ml azeotropic ethanol with 420 ml H2O
    - added 10g of apple wood chips; broiled in the oven for 5 min to simulate the charring of barrels
    - 1 hour at 120C/15 psig in mason jar with lid closed tight
    - let cool
    - the color is quite nice; a light brick red
- Second run through the autoclave today
- Finished the CO2 scrubber yesterday
    - bubble air through solution
      - NaOH + CaOH + CO2 -> NaOH + CaCO3
      - sodium hydroxide is an absorption catalyst through the production of sodium carbonate
      - calcium carbonate precipitates for easy removal

## 16 Oct 2018
- looking into making aged whiskey very quickly
    - UV irradiation (possibly with catalyst + heat) to catalyze the breakdown of lignin into aromatic compounds
    - heat (possibly lower intensity photoirradiation) to catalyze the synthesis of more complex aromatic compounds
- could probably make whiskey from the lignin in cardboard or newspaper ;)

### Aged Whiskey
- Extraction phase
    - fluctuating high temperature and pressure of ethanol and oak barrel material
      - maybe sonication? -> probably not scalable
      - maybe requires oxygen? (probably not)
- Irradiation phase
    - UV irradiation (280–300 nm [@lanzalunga_photo-_2000]) to catalyze lignin degradation
    - ozonation? -> no; leads to overoxidation
- Alternate until finished
    - use opacity as an indicator of extraction efficiency or completeness

## 30 Aug 2018
I spent all day yesterday fixing my laptop OS. It started with a simple upgrade that I had been delaying for several weeks. For some unknown reason, the update failed but didn't roll back the changes. So I was left with a half functioning 18.04 system that failed to log in after I rebooted. Fortunately I had backed up my drive the day before. I made an extra copy of my home folder just in case.
So I figured this would be a good opportunity to try out Qubes. Six hours later, I still hadn't been able to get it to work. I was able to get into the text installation menus, but couldn't get encryption to work due to a known bug. I'm fairly certain the problems I was having were: *A*) Nvidia graphics and *B*) PCIE related. I tried every grub flag that I found on the internet... must have rebooted a hundred times. Finally I gave up on Qubes and settled on a clean install of Ubuntu 18.04. After much fiddling with grub flags I got it to work.

Last night I was a part of a conversation about work. One of my friends was considering a promotion. He would be transitioning from working somewhat independently to managing a dozen people. Essentially the discussion boiled down to how much his happiness was worth to him. Everyone in the room agreed that their current work situation was not ideal. The descriptions ranged from "I don't hate working there" to "I really hate my job". These are highly skilled workers, mind you. I saw how these people, whom I admire, just hated work or at the very least thought of it as a necessary evil. I never want to be that way. #journal

- haven't been feeling the best lately; had my first migraine in something like a year yesterday #journal
- ethanol brewing has successfully yielded more than a gallon of ~80%
    - the distillation column didn't separate as well as I hope- I suspect the small entrance hole (1/8" pipe) was too small
    - I overloaded the column and contaminated the liquor with copper. Doesn't matter since I'm not drinking it and I'll be running it through an all glass system for the final distillation
    - added come charcoal to remove some impurities- mostly worried about methanol

## 27 Jul 2018
- ethanol brewing is slowing; since this is entirely for chemistry, I'll let it ferment to completion
- hopefully I will test my pressure cooker still soon
- I broke my 1m chromatography column yesterday :,(

## 26 Jul 2018
- A lot has happened; I've been too busy to update here :(
- Started a test on ozone sterilization for ethanol production on Monday?
    - I originally wanted to do a side-by-side test of ozone versus placebo, but I messed up the procedure. So I just sparged ozone in both 5 gal carboys to make sure it was feasible in the first place. Plus, I am almost out of abosolute ethanol for the lab. I will have to make a fractionating column to distill it.
- Urea evaporation went poorly. The original solution is perfectly clean, but attempting to boil 2.5 gallons of liquid outside that emits ammonia is difficult to keep clean. Also, I neglected to check whether the latex rubber tubing I used as a gasket was compatible with ammonia. Spoiler... it isn't. So now I am recrystallizing the urea just like I would have done with cheaper fertilizer grade.
- The gym bet failed. Partly because my partner wasn't able to start the bet and partly because it is just too much of a time commitment. Even 30-45 min per day seems excessive. I made it a week without interruption but decided to end it after that. For now, I do a few sprints or quick foot ladder drills in the morning. Just enough to get my heart rate up and that seems to be working.
- The DES one-pot recovery hasn't worked. My guess is that the total solubility of metals in DES is lower than water so I need a greater volume. Something I can easily look up. I started with 1/10 mole choline chloride:1/5 mole ethylene glycol. Roughly 10 mL of solution. A small crystal of iodine was added. I added a sim card for the gold content. The plastic card warped and the iodine color was lost over a day or so, but the gold bits of the card seemed only slightly degraded. I added more iodine but after several days the sim card remained unchanged. I could use more DES or I could electroplate the solution. If all the metal has dissolved in the DES, electroplating will give pure metals. If I recycle the solution by electrolysis and dissolution simultaneously, the metals will plate as impure alloys or even metal sponge.
- The vermiculite furnace failed: the whole thing practically crumbled. The strength of the material wasn't high enough to allow removal of the form. If I had used a metal form, I could have either left it there permanently or calcined the entire thing before removing it. Wood just couldn't handle high enough temperature even just the drying stage. I'll just have to use a metal bucket or similar next time.

- currently evaporating urea solution (Blue DEF) to get highly pure urea
- still evaporating the zinc ammonium chloride solution; foaming is a major problem; probably better to buy it next time
- made some iodine ([Doug's Lab Video](https://youtu.be/E5eWKoZ5JzM))

- DES's are even more awesome than I imagined [@liu_recent_2015, @alonso_deep_2016]
- applications to explore:
    - electropolishing of stainless
    - electrodeposition of aluminum
    - biodiesel manufacture
    - electrowinning of gold plating
    - organic synthesis of all kinds :)
- further investigation of [@bagh_ionic_2014] revealed an electrochemical window of only 2.66-3.74 V for DES5 from 100-130C, so it makes sense that I was depositing zinc using 5V
    - make sure temperature is above 130C and voltage is <3.7V
- Testing second batch (1/5 mol scale) of DES5
    - amine smell when attempting to dry >160C... definitely didn't finish drying
    - attempting 3.3V 150C electrolysis using MMO/titanium anode/cathode; actual voltage is 2.66V;
    - saturated with at least 15g sodium chloride

## 07 Jul 2018
- finished construction of the verm box
- initial tests with DES resulted in precipitated spongy grey material onto the cathode
    - Two possibilities: sodium was being produced and reacting with residual water
    - zinc was being reduced from the DES because the voltage was ~5.0V which might be enough to break the Choline chloride: Zinc chloride bond -> will try 3.3V tomorrow
- Started a second 1/5 mole scale using pure HCl this time
    - 16.28g zinc oxide + 15g H2O + 80g HCl 20.2% -> 41.7g ZnCl2*4H2O
    - reduced the resulting liquid to saturated solution; made sure white HCl fumes were gone
    - added 28g choline chloride
    - boiled to get rid of water; >150C
    - total weight of beaker + stir bar + DES = 69.5g
- DES's would make a great high temp heat transfer liquid instead of mineral oil or other flammable solvent
- the first test was with a small piece of platinum wire + copper cathode; not much current flow; will try larger MMO anode + titanium cathode tomorrow
    - in order to make this a good video, I should try more readily available cathodes; carbon for starters
- high index of refraction for DES5 (n = 1.5) [@bagh_ionic_2014] makes images appear larger than expected from a glass of water (n = 1.3)
- TODO: add pic of DES index of refraction demo

## 05 Jul 2018
- filmed starting construction of vermiculite refractory box
    - constructing the box is probably not the best
    - I should just suck it up and use a round metal former
- synthesized zinc chloride 1/10 scale: 8.14g ZnO + 25g HCl 32% soln. + 5mL H2O
    - apparently anhydrous zinc chloride was used in the paper [@bagh_ionic_2014]
    - I added the requisite amount of choline chloride (14g)
    - Tomorrow I will evaporate it down. Hopefully the DES is enough to keep hydrolysis to a minimum
- researched platinum group metals concentration in street dust

## 15 MAY 2018
I need to get back to work. Spent the weekend at my parents house. Partly for my brother's graduation and partly for Mother's Day. All my sibs were there. I didn't get a headache this time... curious.

## 04 MAY 2018
Been a little off lately. Not quite to the point of depression, but certainly getting there. I'm sure my RescueTime and logkeys data will show how little I've worked the past 3 days. Further evidence for the Kale experiment started a little less than a month ago. I haven't had any symptoms since I started except for now, exactly coinciding with a break from consuming leafy greens.

## 29 APR 2018
So I didn't sleep last night. I "went" to bed at 4am and got up again at 5am without any actual sleep.
Writing academic papers even informally on this blog is painstaking. I wish there was a IDE for journal article writing.

## 17 APR 2018
I tried to use <eatthismuch.com> yesterday. A mildly unpleasant experience. Don't get me wrong, its an admirable site. It just has limitations, which in my opinion, are debilitating. I am now convinced I should write my own.

A few weeks ago I looked into writing my own recipe recommender system. When I located eatthismuch, I decided it wasn't worth it (without even looking at the site in depth). Competition is not my strong suit. But, now, having actually reviewed the site, it doesn't appear all its cracked up to be. They haven't actually captured the semantics of recipes and food prep. The site just seems like a backend collection of if...then statements without any sort of knowledge. For instance, I told the site that I would prefer to eat the food 'whole egg' for breakfast. So when I refreshed the recommendations, the site gave me 1-2 whole *raw* eggs for breakfast. A human, of course, would recognize that input as saying that I would prefer to use eggs as an ingredient in my breakfasts. Of course, I could learn how to use the site properly, but I don't want to do that. I want a recipe/food/meal prep program to have zero learning curve. Like a human whom you ask, "What should I make for dinner tonight." Therefore, I would like to attempt a meal planning service.

## 14 APR 2018
A week of uninterrupted happiness and motivation. I can't remember if that has ever happened to me. Since the last episode on April 5, I have been eating a salad composed principally of leafy green every morning. The hypothesis is that somehow nitric oxide is contributing to my happiness. But whatever the real reason this is working, I'm not going to stop with the breakfast salads.

## 06 APR 2018
Feeling much better today.

I think I'll move any conversations about AI to a separate [page][] from now on.

## 05 APR 2018
Had a depressive episode this morning. Only just arrived at the library (3:30pm). Tested a hypothesis that this episode might be related to nitric oxide system. Consumed 6g of citrulline and 5-6 leaves of kale to test. Oral mouthwash last night and exercise depleted body stores of nitric oxide precursors. That intervention doesn't seem to be working sufficiently. I have a constant need for comfort.

**QOTD:** How does the brain determine what inputs represent features and what are classes? Does it separate the two? Are classes disjoint? Features not so?

### Why do we have short term memory?
Is it solely to organize actions into a specific order? A telephone number consists of numbers 0-9 but only the specific order is important. Altering the connection weights between any particular number and that sequence isn't very useful. I.e. The fact that a particular sequence has a 9 in it doesn't matter.

If you were to ask Alexa, "What time is it?" You don't want the response to be, "1:26 PM the time it is." Although technically correct (the best kind of correct), it is not the typical response and it doesn't conform to the rules of grammar and syntax. Unless you asked Alexa to change her name to Yoda, of course. An example so simple is certainly understandable for humans because the time scale of the order switching is only a few seconds (within the human short term memory window). A desirable AI system should ideally be able to order an infinite sequence of events, which is obviously impossible.

Hmmm... it seems that visual imagination is competitive in space while auditory imagination is competitive in time. For example, when I think about how a particular object looks and activate its critical feature pattern, that object appears in my mind always in the center of focus. If I attempt to place that object in my periphery, my focus always snaps to it. I cannot simultaneously hold my focus at the center of the visual field and imagine an object in my periphery. I can, of course, imagine lots of different objects of varying complexity, but never two objects of a class. E.g. I can imagine a red circle and a blue circle but not both simultaneously. My mind's eye flits back and forth between them, unable to make permanent changes to the appearance of either. Oddly enough, if the circles touch or overlap, I can imagine them as one shape (like a figure eight). In essence, visual imagination is competitive in space. An object is regarded as one if it is continuous in space, and only one object can be manipulated in imagination at a time.

Likewise, auditory imagination is competitive in time although this one is considerable harder to explain because I cannot express it in alternate dimensionality like I do with visual imagination.

## 03 APR 2018
I dreamed of Prolog last night. Do you know how hard it is to program in your dreams?

### Designing Programs
Syntax, toy problem, blah, syntax, syntax, syntax, toy problem. That's how the vast majority of "tutorials" on programming languages teach and the complete opposite of how one uses a programming language. To use a programming language (and any language for that matter), one starts with an conceptual idea of what one wants to explain or do. From there, a series of decisions are made to accomplish that goal.  Instead of teaching tiny bits of syntax which have no inherent purpose to the brain, wouldn't it be better to show the brain a new item that is actually useful? Teaching syntax is necessary, no doubt, but it shouldn't be the first step in learning a language. E.g. Rosetta Stone and DuoLingo use the practical approach. A lot of online programs use the *learn by example* path, which is somewhat better. But they fail where you have to make actual design decisions later using the particular programming language. E.g. Why would one choose to use a set() over a dict() in python?

I've run into this problem headfirst while learning Prolog. Of the few tutorials on Youtube, none of them cover anything more than syntax. Github is full of *practice problems* from such and such a college course or book.

Fortunately, I've come across a book which might be of use for the particular area of Prolog. ~~The Practice of Prolog~~ [@sterling_practice_1990] teaches how to develop a project in Prolog from start to finish.

## 02 APR 2018
Recently I have been learning about Prolog. I like the idea of pure declarative languages. The beauty of simply defining the problem and having the interpreter/compiler solve the problem is striking. It is quite different from my previous programming adventures in C++ and python. I stumbled upon a realization this morning: Backtracking in Prolog seems to be the exact mechanism that Adaptive Resonance Theory calls "Resonance and Reset".

I've been going about this all wrong. I've been so focused on finding out all the ways the brain solves the problem of knowledge acquisition and use that I have neglected the reason why that problem had to be solved in the first place. The human brain has assuredly a vast number of features that help it solve that problem. A number of them are sure to be superfluous, redundant, and downright incorrect thanks to evolution. Trying to wrap my head around all the various features of the brain is nigh impossible especially since I currently believe there are emergent properties of the brain. A better solution might be to solve the problem of knowledge acquisition from first principles. I'm certainly not the first person to do this. Perhaps all of philosophy (and certainly Ontology) is in this pursuit.

For instance: Why did the brain develop grouping (e.g. a set of pixels on the retina are collectively denoted 'square')? By assigning a group, the brain can modify its internal state only once and have that change propagate to all affected members rather than modifying each affected member separately, thus saving energy.

So the question is: What problems compose knowledge acquisition and use? At first glance, knowledge accuracy and knowledge acquisition speed are a trade off. Knowledge that is applied to a set that is not completely consistent is known as a heuristic.

## 29 Mar 2018
*[stream]*
What would my ideal schedule look like? I have attempted many times in the past to streamline my routine and plan my days (sometimes months) into the future. It never seems to work. Four days is my typical stretch. Then I revert back to my primitive, unscheduled self. Its a tiring routine in and of itself. I keep recalling something I read about Ben Franklin, that he would practice one and only one routine for a month before working up to another one. In the past, I have thought that he just doesn't know how to push himself. But perhaps he really knew what he was doing? My track record of implementing change is practically nil. Perhaps the mind, no matter how excellent or effortful, just can't handle that much change. Inevitably, something breaks down.  
In other news, the fasting has somewhat failed. I think intermittent fasting has its merits. I certainly started out feeling much much healthier and my mood stabilized a bit. My memory mostly returned. The first day I skipped breakfast and lunch. I then only ate 'dinner' after I felt hungry for a couple hours. I made it to 4pm the first day. 5:30pm the second. By day four I didn't even want to eat at 7pm. That is the problem that I am facing now. Last night I stayed up to 4am (a whole problem by itself) and I felt just insane hunger at 3am for some reason. I hadn't eaten much that day because I felt no hunger. I would feel my stomach rumbling, but no desire to consume food. My calorie count is epically low over the last couple days. By my resting metabolic rate I should be consuming circa 3000 kcal per day. Likely I was consuming less than 1500 on some days. Certainly I am in ketosis. I attempted to counteract the low energy a bit by consuming more fat, namely bulletproof coffee. I am still consuming my protein shake thing.[^2] If I wasn't so poor, it would also contain a lot more fat. The only fat I have used in the past in mixes like that is MCT oil. Solid fats would require more prep that I am used to doing. Perhaps I can add some olive oil instead. I tried that with the breast milk project and it doesn't taste good. Today I had, in addition to BP coffee, a breakfast of microwaved broccoli with butter, salt, pepper, and mustard seeds (for the enzymatic conversion to sulforaphane). This was only sort-of breakfast since it was 1pm.  
Let's try an experiment shall we. I'm going to remove/disable social media from my phone. My big crutches are Facebook, Reddit, and Youtube. Combined I spend at least several hours per day on them. I don't need that. The only part I might miss is the event updates on FB. I will still have email, text messaging, and snapchat. The last one because its the only way I seem to be able to communicate with one person in particular. I need to figure something out to minimize that distraction. Note: I've noticed that I can't leave my phone facing up within my visual field... I see phantom LED notifications. Out of the corner of my eye it appears that the indicator LED on my phone is illuminated, but when I look closer nothing has arrived. Serious addiction.  
I don't think I can completely eliminate my cell phone. I did that once. For about 6 months I didn't carry a phone because my old one broke down and I was too poor to buy another. As a consequence, I was freer, but I also lost contact. My mom was especially distraught. She wasn't really on FB at that time and the few calls I did make to her were now nonexistent. Now, of course, she has a phone and is more active on FB. Similarly, I can't forgo the laptop. I am a programmer by skill set. Not impossible, but practically untenable to be a programmer without a computer.
