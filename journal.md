I tried to use <eatthismuch.com> yesterday. A mildly unpleasant experience. Don't get me wrong, its an admirable site. It just has limitations, which in my opinion, are debilitating. I am now convinced I should write my own.

A few weeks ago I looked into writing my own recipe recommender system. When I located eatthismuch, I decided it wasn't worth it (without even looking at the site in depth). Competition is not my strong suit. But, now, having actually reviewed the site, it doesn't appear all its cracked up to be. They haven't actually captured the semantics of recipes and food prep. The site just seems like a backend collection of if...then statements without any sort of knowledge. For instance, I told the site that I would prefer to eat the food 'whole egg' for breakfast. So when I refreshed the recommendations, the site gave me 1-2 whole *raw* eggs for breakfast. A human, of course, would recognize that input as saying that I would prefer to use eggs as an ingredient in my breakfasts. Of course, I could learn how to use the site properly, but I don't want to do that. I want a recipe/food/meal prep program to have zero learning curve. Like a human whom you ask, "What should I make for dinner tonight." Therefore, I would like to attempt a meal planning service.

A week of uninterrupted happiness and motivation. I can't remember if that has ever happened to me. Since the last episode on April 5, I have been eating a salad composed principally of leafy green every morning. The hypothesis is that somehow nitric oxide is contributing to my happiness. But whatever the real reason this is working, I'm not going to stop with the breakfast salads.

Feeling much better today.

I think I'll move any conversations about AI to a separate [page][] from now on.

## 05 APR 2018
Had a depressive episode this morning. Only just arrived at the library (3:30pm). Tested a hypothesis that this episode might be related to nitric oxide system. Consumed 6g of citrulline and 5-6 leaves of kale to test. Oral mouthwash last night and exercise depleted body stores of nitric oxide precursors. That intervention doesn't seem to be working sufficiently. I have a constant need for comfort.

**QOTD:** How does the brain determine what inputs represent features and what are classes? Does it separate the two? Are classes disjoint? Features not so?

### Why do we have short term memory?
Is it solely to organize actions into a specific order? A telephone number consists of numbers 0-9 but only the specific order is important. Altering the connection weights between any particular number and that sequence isn't very useful. I.e. The fact that a particular sequence has a 9 in it doesn't matter.

If you were to ask Alexa, "What time is it?" You don't want the response to be, "1:26 PM the time it is." Although technically correct (the best kind of correct), it is not the typical response and it doesn't conform to the rules of grammar and syntax. Unless you asked Alexa to change her name to Yoda, of course. An example so simple is certainly understandable for humans because the time scale of the order switching is only a few seconds (within the human short term memory window). A desirable AI system should ideally be able to order an infinite sequence of events, which is obviously impossible.

Hmmm... it seems that visual imagination is competitive in space while auditory imagination is competitive in time. For example, when I think about how a particular object looks and activate its critical feature pattern, that object appears in my mind always in the center of focus. If I attempt to place that object in my periphery, my focus always snaps to it. I cannot simultaneously hold my focus at the center of the visual field and imagine an object in my periphery. I can, of course, imagine lots of different objects of varying complexity, but never two objects of a class. E.g. I can imagine a red circle and a blue circle but not both simultaneously. My mind's eye flits back and forth between them, unable to make permanent changes to the appearance of either. Oddly enough, if the circles touch or overlap, I can imagine them as one shape (like a figure eight). In essence, visual imagination is competitive in space. An object is regarded as one if it is continuous in space, and only one object can be manipulated in imagination at a time.

Likewise, auditory imagination is competitive in time although this one is considerable harder to explain because I cannot express it in alternate dimensionality like I do with visual imagination.

I dreamed of Prolog last night. Do you know how hard it is to program in your dreams?

### Designing Programs
Syntax, toy problem, blah, syntax, syntax, syntax, toy problem. That's how the vast majority of "tutorials" on programming languages teach and the complete opposite of how one uses a programming language. To use a programming language (and any language for that matter), one starts with an conceptual idea of what one wants to explain or do. From there, a series of decisions are made to accomplish that goal.  Instead of teaching tiny bits of syntax which have no inherent purpose to the brain, wouldn't it be better to show the brain a new item that is actually useful? Teaching syntax is necessary, no doubt, but it shouldn't be the first step in learning a language. E.g. Rosetta Stone and DuoLingo use the practical approach. A lot of online programs use the *learn by example* path, which is somewhat better. But they fail where you have to make actual design decisions later using the particular programming language. E.g. Why would one choose to use a set() over a dict() in python?

I've run into this problem headfirst while learning Prolog. Of the few tutorials on Youtube, none of them cover anything more than syntax. Github is full of *practice problems* from such and such a college course or book.

Fortunately, I've come across a book which might be of use for the particular area of Prolog. [*The Practice of Prolog*](#sterling_practice_1990) teaches how to develop a project in Prolog from start to finish.

## 02 APR 2018
Recently I have been learning about Prolog. I like the idea of pure declarative languages. The beauty of simply defining the problem and having the interpreter/compiler solve the problem is striking. It is quite different from my previous programming adventures in C++ and python. I stumbled upon a realization this morning: Backtracking in Prolog seems to be the exact mechanism that Adaptive Resonance Theory calls "Resonance and Reset".

I've been going about this all wrong. I've been so focused on finding out all the ways the brain solves the problem of knowledge acquisition and use that I have neglected the reason why that problem had to be solved in the first place. The human brain has assuredly a vast number of features that help it solve that problem. A number of them are sure to be superfluous, redundant, and downright incorrect thanks to evolution. Trying to wrap my head around all the various features of the brain is nigh impossible especially since I currently believe there are emergent properties of the brain. A better solution might be to solve the problem of knowledge acquisition from first principles. I'm certainly not the first person to do this. Perhaps all of philosophy (and certainly Ontology) is in this pursuit.

For instance: Why did the brain develop grouping (e.g. a set of pixels on the retina are collectively denoted 'square')? By assigning a group, the brain can modify its internal state only once and have that change propagate to all affected members rather than modifying each affected member separately, thus saving energy.

So the question is: What problems compose knowledge acquisition and use? At first glance, knowledge accuracy and knowledge acquisition speed are a trade off. Knowledge that is applied to a set that is not completely consistent is known as a heuristic.

*[stream]*
What would my ideal schedule look like? I have attempted many times in the past to streamline my routine and plan my days (sometimes months) into the future. It never seems to work. Four days is my typical stretch. Then I revert back to my primitive, unscheduled self. Its a tiring routine in and of itself. I keep recalling something I read about Ben Franklin, that he would practice one and only one routine for a month before working up to another one. In the past, I have thought that he just doesn't know how to push himself. But perhaps he really knew what he was doing? My track record of implementing change is practically nil. Perhaps the mind, no matter how excellent or effortful, just can't handle that much change. Inevitably, something breaks down.  
In other news, the fasting has somewhat failed. I think intermittent fasting has its merits. I certainly started out feeling much much healthier and my mood stabilized a bit. My memory mostly returned. The first day I skipped breakfast and lunch. I then only ate 'dinner' after I felt hungry for a couple hours. I made it to 4pm the first day. 5:30pm the second. By day four I didn't even want to eat at 7pm. That is the problem that I am facing now. Last night I stayed up to 4am (a whole problem by itself) and I felt just insane hunger at 3am for some reason. I hadn't eaten much that day because I felt no hunger. I would feel my stomach rumbling, but no desire to consume food. My calorie count is epically low over the last couple days. By my resting metabolic rate I should be consuming circa 3000 kcal per day. Likely I was consuming less than 1500 on some days. Certainly I am in ketosis. I attempted to counteract the low energy a bit by consuming more fat, namely bulletproof coffee. I am still consuming my protein shake thing.[^2] If I wasn't so poor, it would also contain a lot more fat. The only fat I have used in the past in mixes like that is MCT oil. Solid fats would require more prep that I am used to doing. Perhaps I can add some olive oil instead. I tried that with the breast milk project and it doesn't taste good. Today I had, in addition to BP coffee, a breakfast of microwaved broccoli with butter, salt, pepper, and mustard seeds (for the enzymatic conversion to sulforaphane). This was only sort-of breakfast since it was 1pm.  
Let's try an experiment shall we. I'm going to remove/disable social media from my phone. My big crutches are Facebook, Reddit, and Youtube. Combined I spend at least several hours per day on them. I don't need that. The only part I might miss is the event updates on FB. I will still have email, text messaging, and snapchat. The last one because its the only way I seem to be able to communicate with one person in particular. I need to figure something out to minimize that distraction. Note: I've noticed that I can't leave my phone facing up within my visual field... I see phantom LED notifications. Out of the corner of my eye it appears that the indicator LED on my phone is illuminated, but when I look closer nothing has arrived. Serious addiction.  
I don't think I can completely eliminate my cell phone. I did that once. For about 6 months I didn't carry a phone because my old one broke down and I was too poor to buy another. As a consequence, I was freer, but I also lost contact. My mom was especially distraught. She wasn't really on FB at that time and the few calls I did make to her were now nonexistent. Now, of course, she has a phone and is more active on FB. Similarly, I can't forgo the laptop. I am a programmer by skill set. Not impossible, but practically untenable to be a programmer without a computer.
