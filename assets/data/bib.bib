Although larger doses of alcohol lead to more severe symptoms, hangover is not solely dose-related (37).


In an experimental setting, 33\% of patients who consumed 1.5 g/kg of body weight of bourbon (which has high congeners) but only 3\% of those who consumed the same dose of vodka (which has low congeners) experienced severe hangover (41).


Alcohol alters cytokine production through a thromboxane pathway. Levels of thromboxane B2 are elevated during experimentally induced alcohol hangover (42), and the administration of tolfenamic acid, a prostaglandin inhibitor, at the time of alcohol consumption has a small prophylactic effect in reducing hangover severity (9).


Alcohol inhibits the effect of antidiuretic hormone on the kidneys, thereby inducing diuresis that is out of proportion to the volume of fluid ingested.

Prophylactic vitamin B6 (pyritinol) reduced the number of hangover symptoms by approximately 50\% in one study (57).


Fifty percent of participants received 1200 mg of vitamin B6 (400 mg at the beginning of the party, 400 mg 3 hours later, and 400 mg at the party's conclusion), and 50\% received placebo.


On a scale of 1 to 10, the mean symptom score (±SD) was 3.2 ± 2.8 with pyritinol and 6.8 ± 3.8 with placebo (P {\textless} 0.01). The mechanism of this effect is unknown.

Two trials have investigated the effect of simple carbohydrates on hangover severity.


Participants received 1.75 g/kg of alcohol from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and an oral glucose or fructose solution (0.5 g/kg or 1 g/kg). Administration of glucose at the time of alcohol ingestion reduced mistakes by 50\% on the choice reaction test (which was given 15 hours later) but slightly increased mistakes on the coordination test. Hangover severity was not affected. The study was limited by the small number of participants (n = 5) in each treatment group. Moreover, the statistical analysis did not account for multiple comparisons.


Ylikahri and coworkers (37) used a similar design to study 109 healthy men (1.75 g/kg of alcohol administered orally over 3 hours, followed by 1 g/kg of oral glucose or fructose). Patients who received glucose or fructose had lower serum levels of free fatty acids and ketones but no change in subjective or objective hangover symptoms.

	abstract = {Basal forebrain dopamine (DA) and 5-HT neurotransmission has been implicated in the mediation of the acute reinforcing actions of ethanol. Neuroadaptation theories predict that compensatory changes in neurochemical systems that are activated by alcohol acutely may underlie symptoms of withdrawal after chronic administration. To test this hypothesis, the release of DA and 5-HT was monitored by microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens of dependent male Wistar rats at the end of a 3–5 week ethanol (8.7\% w/v) liquid diet regimen, during 8 hr of withdrawal, and during renewed availability of ethanol involving (1) the opportunity to operantly self-administer ethanol (10\% w/v) for 60 min, followed by (2) unlimited access to the ethanol-liquid diet. Results were compared to control groups pair-fed with ethanol-free liquid diet and trained to self-administer either ethanol or water. In nondependent rats, operant ethanol self-administration increased both DA and 5-HT release in the NAC. Withdrawal from the chronic ethanol diet produced a progressive suppression in the release of these transmitters over the 8 hr withdrawal period. Self-administration of ethanol reinstated and maintained DA release at prewithdrawal levels but failed to completely restore 5-HT efflux. 5-HT levels recovered rapidly, however, within 1 hr of reexposure to ethanol liquid diet. These findings suggest that deficits in accumbal monoamine release may contribute to the negative affective consequences ethanol withdrawal and, thereby, motivate ethanol-seeking behavior in dependent subjects.},

Our previous studies have indicated that methylene blue (MB) functions as an alternative electron carrier and enhances brain metabolism. In addition, MB has been shown to be protective against neurodegeneration and brain injury. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of MB in astrocytes. Cell viability assays showed that MB treatment significantly protected primary astrocytes from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) \& reoxygenation induced cell death. We also studied the effect of MB on cellular oxygen and glucose metabolism in primary astrocytes following OGD-reoxygenation injury. MB treatment significantly increased cellular oxygen consumption, glucose uptake and ATP production in primary astrocytes. In conclusion our study demonstrated that MB protects astrocytes against OGD-reoxygenation injury by improving astrocyte cellular respiration.},

	abstract = {Agmatine [2-(4-aminobutyl)guanidine] is an endogenous amine proposed as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator that binds to multiple target receptors in brain. Besides, many central and peripheral functions, agmatine have been implicated in the process of drug addiction. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of centrally injected agmatine on nicotine induced locomotor sensitization in Swiss male mice. Our data shows that repeated injections of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, sc, twice daily for 7 days) gradually increased locomotion during 7 days development period or after 3 days (nicotine) withdrawal phase challenged with nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, sc) on day 11. Mice were pretreated with agmatine (40-80 microg, icv) or agents known to increase endogenous brain agmatine levels [e.g. an agmatine biosynthetic precursor, L-arginine (80 microg, icv), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethyl-ornithine (50 microg, icv), diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (25 microg, icv) and agmatinase inhibitor, arcaine (50 microg, icv)] 30 min before daily first nicotine injection or during nicotine withdrawal phase. All these treatments attenuated the development as well as incubation of locomotor sensitization to nicotine. Coadministration of agmatine (20 microg, icv) and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors agonist, clonidine (0.1 microg, icv) evoked synergistic inhibition of nicotine sensitization. Conversely, prior administration of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (5mg/kg, ip) or idazoxan (0.4 mg/kg, ip) reversed the inhibitory effect of agmatine on nicotine sensitization. There was no significant difference in activity between mice injected with any of these agents/saline alone and saline/saline groups. These data indicate that agmatine attenuates nicotine induced locomotor sensitization via a mechanism which may involve alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. Thus, agmatine might have therapeutic implications in the treatment of nicotine addiction and deserve further investigations.},

The depression of hepatic and cerebral glutathione levels in ethanol-consuming rats was prevented by simultaneous treatment with α-tocopherol. Other putative indices of hepatic pro-oxidant events, namely levels of mixed function oxidase and proteolytic activity, were elevated by α-tocopherol both in the presence and absence of ethanol In addition, levels of enzymes especially susceptible to oxidative degradation, glutamine synthetase and creatine kinase, were depressed in the liver following treatment with ethanol or α-tocopherol. Parameters rapidly responsive to oxidative changes revealed the antioxidant property of α-tocopherol, while protein-based indices reflecting more extended events suggested a pro-oxidant effect of this vitamin. Results suggest that high levels of α-tocopherol can simultaneously lead to a more reduced intracellular environment and yet to localized evidence of enhanced oxidative events.},

	abstract = {The question of whether agmatine crosses the blood-brain barrier has not been directly addressed, even though peripheral injection of this compound has produced behavioral responses in drug withdrawal, antidepressant, and anti-anxiety paradigms. Two models were used in this investigation. In the first, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with agmatine (10, 50, or 300 mg/kg body weight) or arginine (600 mg/kg). After 1 or 3 hours, the animals were killed under gas anesthesia by perfusing their brains with ice-cold saline, and whole-brain agmatine was measured by HPLC. In parallel studies, a rhesus monkey was injected under gas anesthesia either intravenously (i.v.) with agmatine (30 mg/kg) or arginine (150 mg/kg), or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with agmatine (0.3 mg/kg i.c.v.). At varying times thereafter, cisterna magna cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma were collected and analyzed for agmatine levels. A rise in mouse brain agmatine was apparent after doses of 50 and 300 mg/kg i.p. Monkey CSF agmatine peaked in parallel with plasma agmatine 15 minutes following intravenous (i.v.) agmatine injection and at one sixth the level of the plasma peak. Monkey CSF agmatine peaked 43 minutes after i.v. arginine injection. The ventricular injection of agmatine resulted in a threefold sustained rise in blood plasma agmatine for at least 24 hours after injection. Therefore, agmatine and its precursor, arginine, cross the blood-brain barrier. CSF agmatine may be newly synthesized from peripherally injected arginine.},

Both doses of curcumin lowered the hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels ( Table 2 ).
The hepatic SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities were significantly suppressed in the alcohol control group compared to the normal group. However, both doses of curcumin supplementation increased the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities.
In this study, we showed that curcumin increases hepatic total AMPK protein expression, which is in turn associated with decreased FAS and PAP activities in mice that are chronically administered alcohol.

However, both doses of curcumin increased the total AMPK and p-AMPK protein levels compared to the alcohol control mice ( Fig. 3 A). Nevertheless, curcumin supplementation at both doses lowered the PAP and FAS activities compared with the alcohol control mice ( Fig. 3 B and C) but did not affect the G6PD activity (Fig. 3 D).Alcohol administration increased the plasma leptin levels compared with the normal mice; however, curcumin supplementation decreased the plasma leptin levels close to those observed in the normal mice (Table 2 ). Both doses of curcumin significantly lowered the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels compared to the alcohol control group. The plasma total cholesterol concentration was reduced by the 0.02\% curcumin dose, whereas the HDL-cholesterol concentration was increased by the 0.05\% curcumin dose. Treatment with both doses of curcumin decreased the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio compared with that obtained in the alcohol control group ( Table 2 ).

The liver damage biomarkers, AST, ALT, LDH and ALP, were all significantly elevated by alcohol administration in mice fed high-fat diet. Curcumin supplementation at both doses significantly lowered the AST, ALT, LDH and ALP activities, which indicates reduced liver damage compared to the alcohol control group (Fig. 1A).
The hepatic ADH activity was significantly suppressed in the alcohol control group compared to the normal group. However, supplement with the 0.05\% dose of curcumin significantly increased the ADH activity (Fig. 2   A). Similarly, the ALDH activity was reduced in the alcohol control group, but both doses of curcumin (0.02\% and 0.05\%) elevated the ALDH activity compared to the alcohol control mice by 18\% and 26\%, respectively ( Fig. 2 B).
Chronic alcohol administration resulted in increased CYP2E1 activity and CYP2E1 protein expression in the liver ( Fig. 2C and D). Conversely, curcumin supplementation (at both doses) significantly decreased the CYP2E1 activity to normal values ( Fig. 2C). Similarly, the CYP2E1 protein expression was also decreased to normal levels by curcumin supplementation ( Fig. 2D)

Eight of nine subjects responded to the oral glutamine load with an increase in plasma glutamine at 30 and 60 min before returning to the control value at 90 min. Ninety minutes after the glutamine administration load both plasma bicarbonate concentration and circulating plasma growth hormone concentration were elevated.

A systematic literature search was conducted. Mean questionnaire values and proportions for depressive symptoms and clinical depression were pooled according to different assessment methods. In controlled studies, standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratio (OR) compared depression in psoriasis patients with controls using the random-effect model. The majority of the 98 eligible studies were conducted in tertiary centers without a control group. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 28\% using questionnaires and the prevalence of clinical depression was 12\% using International Classification of Diseases codes, 19\% using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, and 9\% for antidepressant use. Psoriasis patients had significantly more depressive symptoms (SMD 1.16; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–1.66), and population-based studies showed that they were at least one and a half times more likely to experience depression (OR 1.57; 95\% CI 1.40–1.76) and used more antidepressants than did controls (OR 4.24, 95\% CI 1.53–11.76). More than 10\% of psoriasis patients suffer from clinical depression, and twice as many have depressive symptoms. The high prevalence of these symptoms is likely to be affected by the tertiary study populations and differential misclassification using questionnaires, where psoriasis-related symptoms may be detected as depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background: Kratom, known botanically as Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.), is an indigenous tree in Southeast Asia. Kratom is currently easily available worldwide via special shops and the Internet to use as a drug of abuse, opioid alternative, or pain killer. So far, the pharmacokinetics of this plant has been studied only in animals, and there is no such study in humans. The major abundant active alkaloid in Kratom, mitragynine, is one of the promising new chemical substances to be developed as a new drug. The aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of mitragynine and assess the linearity in pharmacokinetics in chronic users. Methods: Since Kratom is illegal in Thailand, studies in healthy subjects would be unethical. We therefore conducted a prospective study by enrolling ten chronic, regular, healthy users. We adjusted the steady state in each subject by giving a known amount of Kratom tea for 7 days before commencement of the experiment. We admitted and gave different oral doses to subjects to confirm linearity in pharmacokinetics. The mitragynine blood concentrations at 17 times points and the urine concentrations during the 24-hour period were collected and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results: Ten male subjects completed the study without adverse reactions. The median duration of abuse was 1.75 years. We analyzed one subject separately due to the abnormal behavior of blood concentration. From data of nine subjects, the pharmacokinetic parameters established were time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (0.83 +/- 0.35 hour), terminal half-life (23.24 +/- 16.07 hours), and the apparent volume of distribution (38.04 +/- 24.32 L/kg). The urine excretion of unchanged form was 0.14\%. The pharmacokinetics were observed to be oral two-compartment model. Conclusion: This was the first pharmacokinetic study in humans, which demonstrated linearity and was consistent with the oral two-compartment model with a terminal half-life of about 1 day. The pharmacokinetic linearity and parameters reported are necessary pharmacological information of Kratom, and there is a possibility for it to be developed medically as a pain killer or better opioid substitute in the future.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The misuse of alcohol, even at levels just above two drinks per day, is a public health problem, but identifying patients with this potentially unhealthy drinking is hindered by the lack of tests. Several blood tests, such as those testing for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or mean corpuscular volume (MCV), are among the commonly used markers to identify very heavy drinking, but combinations of these markers have rarely been tested in lighter drinkers. We examined the relationship between alcohol drinking and the levels of these markers in a national population-based study composed primarily of lighter drinkers.

Method:
Data were analyzed from 8,708 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey after excluding subjects with iron overload; with hepatitis B and C; who were pregnant; and who were taking prescription drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), barbiturates, and hydroxyurea (Droxia and Hydrea). The relationship between the amount of alcohol drinking and GGT, aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio, MCV of erythrocytes, and apolipoprotein A1 and B were analyzed and adjusted for potential liver injury risk factors.

Results:
The prevalence of unhealthy alcohol drinking (defined as consumption of more than two standard drinks per day) was 6.7\%. Heavier drinkers tended to be younger and reported an average of 4.2 drinks per day. When tested alone or in combination, the sensitivity and positive predictive values for these blood tests were too low to be clinically useful in identifying the subjects in the heavier drinking category.

Conclusions:
In this large, national, population-based study, the markers of heavy drinking studied here, either alone or in combination, did not appear to be useful in identifying unhealthy drinking. More work is needed to find the novel marker(s) associated with risky alcohol drinking.},

	abstract = {Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid of the human body. Besides its role as a constituent of proteins and its importance in amino acid transamination, glutamine has regulatory capacity in immune and cell modulation. Glutamine deprivation reduces proliferation of lymphocytes, influences expression of surface activation markers on lymphocytes and monocytes, affects the production of cytokines, and stimulates apoptosis. Moreover, glutamine administration seems to have a positive effect on glucose metabolism in the state of insulin resistance. Glutamine influences a variety of different molecular pathways. Glutamine stimulates the formation of heat shock protein 70 in monocytes by enhancing the stability of mRNA, influences the redox potential of the cell by enhancing the formation of glutathione, induces cellular anabolic effects by increasing the cell volume, activates mitogen-activated protein kinases, and interacts with particular aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases in specific glutamine-sensing metabolism. Glutamine is applied under clinical conditions as an oral, parenteral, or enteral supplement either as the single amino acid or in the form of glutamine-containing dipeptides for preventing mucositis/stomatitis and for preventing glutamine-deficiency in critically ill patients. Because of the high turnover rate of glutamine, even high amounts of glutamine up to a daily administration of 30 g can be given without any important side effects.},

	abstract = {Purpose
In recent years in vivo microdialysis has become an important method in research studies investigating the alterations of neurotransmitters in the extracellular fluid of the brain. Based on the major involvement of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mediating a variety of alcohol effects in the mammalian brain, numerous microdialysis studies have focused on the dynamical behavior of these systems in response to alcohol.

Methods
Here we performed multiple meta-analyses on published datasets from the rat brain: (i) we studied basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate and GABA in brain regions that belong to a neurocircuitry involved in neuropsychiatric diseases, especially in alcoholism (Noori et al., Addict Biol 17:827-864, 2012); (ii) we examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on glutamate and GABA levels within this network and (iii) we studied alcohol withdrawal-induced alterations in glutamate and GABA levels within this neurocircuitry.

Results
For extraction of basal concentrations of these neurotransmitters, datasets of 6932 rats were analyzed and the absolute basal glutamate and GABA levels were estimated for 18 different brain sites. In response to different doses of acute ethanol administration, datasets of 529 rats were analyzed and a non-linear dose response (glutamate and GABA release) relationship was observed in several brain sites. Specifically, glutamate in the nucleus accumbens shows a decreasing logarithmic dose response curve. Finally, regression analysis of 11 published reports employing brain microdialysis experiments in 104 alcohol-dependent rats reveals very consistent augmented extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in various brain sites that correlate with the intensity of the withdrawal response were identified.

Conclusions
In summary, our results provide standardized basal values for future experimental and in silico studies on neurotransmitter release in the rat brain and may be helpful to understand the effect of ethanol on neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, this study illustrates the benefit of meta-analyses using the generalization of a wide range of preclinical data.},

These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic.

	abstract = {Background
This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the probiotic VSL\#3 in acute alcoholic intestinal injury, and evaluate the effect of VSL\#3, glutamine,VSL\#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL\#3 therapy in a rat model.

Methods
Six- to eight-week-old male wild-type rats were divided into seven groups. To establish the acute alcohol liver disease model, rats received three doses of corn starch dissolved in PBS/40\% alcohol administered intra-gastrically every 12 hours. Treatment groups received an intra-gastric dose of VSL\#3, Glutamine, heat-killed VSL\#3, or VSL\#3+Glutamine 30 minutes prior to alcohol administration. The placebo group was treated with PBS prior to alcohol administration. TNFα and endotoxin in plasma was measured by ELISA and Tachypleus Ameboctye Lysate assays, and electron microscopy, Western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to identify the mechanisms of VSL\#3 in the regulation of epithelial permeability.

Results
First, compared with control group, endotoxin and TNFα in alcohol group was obviously high. At the same time, in VSL\#3 group,the expression of endotoxin and TNFα obviously lower than the alcohol group. And the trends of the expression of tight junction proteins in these groups were reversed with the change of endotoxin and TNFα. Second, compared the groups of VSL\#3 with glutamine,VSL\#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL\#3,we found that both VSL\#3 and heat-killed VSL\#3, glutamine were as effective as VSL\#3+glutamine in the treatment of acute alcohol liver disease, the expression of endotoxin and TNFα were lower than the alcohol group, and tight junction proteins were higher than the alcohol group whereas the expression of tight junction proteins were higher in VSL\#3 + glutamine group than either agent alone, but have no significant difference.

Conclusion
We conclude that VSL\#3 treatment can regulate the ecological balance of the gut microflora, preventing passage of endotoxin and other bacterial products from the gut lumen into the portal circulation and down-regulating the expression of TNFα, which could otherwise down-regulate the expression of tight junction proteins and increase epithelial permeability.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
To explore the time of day effects of alcohol on sleep, we examined sleep following alcohol administered at four times of day and three homeostatic loads during a 20-hr forced desynchrony (FD) protocol.

Participants:
Twenty-six healthy young adults (21–25 yrs) were studied.

Design:
Participants were dosed at 4 clock times: 0400 (n = 6; 2 females), 1600 (n = 7; 4 females), 1000 (n = 6; 1 female) or 2200 (n = 7; 2 females). Participants slept 2300 to 0800 for at least 12 nights before the in-lab FD study. Double blind placebo and alcohol (vodka tonic targeting 0.05g\% concentration) beverages were each administered three times during FD at different homeostatic loads: low (4.25 or 2.24 hrs awake), medium (8.25 or 6.25 hrs awake), high (12.25 or 10.25 hrs awake) in the 0400 and 1600 or 1000 and 2200 groups, respectively. Sleep was staged and subjected to spectral analysis.

Measurements and Results:
Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) confirmed targeted maximal levels. At bedtime, BrAC was 0 in the low and medium homeostatic load conditions; however, at high homeostatic load, BrAC was still measurable. Spectral characteristics of sleep were unaffected with alcohol at any time of day. Few alcohol related changes were seen for sleep stages; however, with alcohol given at 0400 at a high homeostatic load there was an increase in wake.

Conclusions:
These data lend support to the idea that alcohol may be disruptive to sleep; however, our findings are inconsistent with the idea that a low dose of alcohol is a useful sleep aid when attempting to sleep at an adverse circadian phase.

When ethanol was infused at a concentration of 24μmol/ml of blood the rate of utilization was 2.8μmol/min per g of liver. 3. Ethanol infusion raised perfusate glucose concentrations and caused a 2.5-fold increase in hepatic glucose output. 4. Final blood lactate concentrations were decreased in ethanol-infused livers, but the mean uptake of lactate from erythrocyte glycolysis was unaffected. 5. Production of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate+3-oxobutyrate) and the ratio [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[3-oxobutyrate] were raised by ethanol. 6. Formation of 3H2O from specifically 3H-labelled glucoses increased in the order [6-3H]{\textless}[3-3H]{\textless}[2-3H]. Production of 3H2O from [2-3H]glucose was significantly greater than that from [3-3H]glucose in both control and ethanol-infused livers. Ethanol significantly decreased 3H2O formation from all [3H]glucoses. 7. Liver glycogen content was unaffected by ethanol infusion. 8. Production of very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerols was inhibited by ethanol and there was a small increase in liver triacylglycerols. Very-low-density-lipoprotein secretion was negatively correlated with the ratio [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[3-oxobutyrate]. Perfusate fatty acid concentrations and molar composition were unaffected by perfusion with ethanol. 9. Ethanol decreased the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into fatty acids and cholesterol. 10. The concentration of total plasma amino acids was unchanged by ethanol, but the concentrations of alanine and glycine were decreased and ([glutamate]+[glutamine]) was raised. 11. It is proposed that the observed effects of ethanol on carbohydrate metabolism are due to an increased conversion of lactate into glucose, possibly by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The increase in gluconeogenesis is accompanied by diminished substrate cycling at glucose–glucose 6-phosphate and at fructose 6-phosphate–fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.},

All the agents tended to down regulate the ethanol-induced increased expression of glutathionine peroxidase 4 (GPX4). All the agents, except catechin, tended to reduce the expression of SOD2 induced by ethanol. Heat shock protein 70 was up regulated by ethanol alone and betaine tended to prevent this. All 4 agents down regulated the expression of Gadd45b in the presence of ethanol, which could explain the mechanism of DNA demethylation associated with the up regulation of the gene expression observed in experimental ALD.

Beliefs about the effects of mixing caffeine and alcohol on hangover or sleep may play a role in motivation to consume these mixtures; therefore, information is needed about actual effects. We investigated whether intoxication with caffeinated vs. non-caffeinated beer differentially affected perceived sleep quality, sleepiness, and hangover incidence and severity the next morning.

Methods
University students (89\%) and recent graduate drinkers were randomized to receive: (1) beer with the equivalent of 69 mg caffeine/12 oz glass of regular beer (n = 28) or (2) beer without caffeine (n = 36), in sufficient quantity to attain a BrAC of 0.12 g\%. After an 8-hour supervised sleep period, participants completed measures of hangover, sleep quality, sleep latency and time asleep, and sleepiness.

Results
While caffeinated beer improved perceived sleep quality, effect sizes were greater for morning alertness than for quality while sleeping, with no effect on sleep latency or total sleep time. No effects were seen on hangover incidence or severity.

Conclusions
Mixing caffeine and alcohol does not significantly impair amount of sleep or sleep latency, hangover, or sleepiness the morning after drinking to intoxication in this population.},

Objective: We aimed to assess whether an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) containing glutamine (as the dipeptide Ala-Gln), carbohydrates, and antioxidants would modulate duodenal protein metabolism in healthy humans.
Design: Thirty healthy control subjects were included and, over a period of 5 h, received by nasogastric tube either saline or ONS providing 11.7 kcal/kg as 0.877 g Ala-Gln/kg, 3.9 g carbohydrates/kg, and antioxidants (29.25 mg vitamin C/kg, 9.75 mg vitamin E/kg, 195 μg β-carotene/kg, 5.85 mg Se/kg, and 390 μg Zn/kg) or glutamine (0.585 g/kg, 2.34 kcal/kg). Simultaneously, a continuous intravenous infusion of l-[1-13C]-leucine was done until endoscopy. Leucine enrichment was assessed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometric analysis, and mucosal fractional synthesis rate was calculated by using intracellular amino acid enrichment as precursor. Mucosal proteolytic pathways were also evaluated.
Results: ONS infusion resulted in a doubling increase (P {\textless} 0.01) of duodenal fractional synthesis rate and a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) decrease in cathepsin D–mediated proteolysis compared with saline, whereas proteasome and Ca2+-dependent activities were unaffected. ONS infusion significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) decreased duodenal glutathione but not glutathione disulfide concentrations or the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide. Insulinemia increased after ONS infusion, whereas plasma essential amino acids decreased. Infusion of glutamine alone did not reproduce ONS effects.
Conclusions: ONS infusion improves duodenal protein balance in healthy humans. Further investigations are needed to study the origin of these effects and to evaluate ONS supply in stressed persons.},

	abstract = {The consumption of alcohol is often accompanied by other foods, such as fruits and vegetables. This study is aimed to investigate the effects of 20 selected fruits on ethanol metabolism to find out their potential health benefits and harmful impacts. The effects of the fruits on ethanol metabolism were characterized by the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood, as well as activities of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in liver of mice. Furthermore, potential health benefits and harmful impacts of the fruits were evaluated by biochemical parameters including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase. Generally, effects of these fruits on ethanol metabolism were very different. Some fruits (such as Citrus limon (yellow), Averrhoa carambola, Pyrus spp., and Syzygium samarangense) could decrease the concentration of ethanol in blood. In addition, several fruits (such as Cucumis melo) showed hepatoprotective effects by significantly decreasing AST or ALT level in blood, while some fruits (such as Averrhoa carambola) showed adverse effects. The results suggested that the consumption of alcohol should not be accompanied by some fruits, and several fruits could be developed as functional foods for the prevention and treatment of hangover and alcohol use disorder.},

A precisely weighed amount (1 g) of the edible portion was mixed with 5 mL of distilled water, and ground into fine particles with a grinder, which mimicked the preparation of fruit juice.


All groups were given 52\% (v/v) ethanol once at a dose of 4 g/kg body weight to induce acute alcohol intoxication. Subsequently, the control was given distilled water at a dose of 10 mL/kg body weight, while the fruit groups were treated once with different fruit juices at the same dose (equal to about 100 g fruit for a person of 60 kg). Two hours after the treatment, the mice were anesthetized. The blood was obtained and a piece of liver tissue was taken from each animal.

Generally, most of the fruit juices did not markedly affect the concentrations of blood ethanol and acetaldehyde.


Since Citrus limon (yellow), Averrhoa carambola, Pyrus spp., and Syzygium samarangense juices could lower the concentration of ethanol in blood, consuming them might be beneficial when drinking alcohol. On the other hand, the results suggested that Chaenomeles sinensis should not be consumed with drinking alcohol because it could increase alcohol concentration in blood.


It was assumed that Averrhoa carambola and Syzygium samarangense juices inhibited the activity of hepatic ALDH and, thus, slowed the clearance of acetaldehyde in blood and, hence, increased its toxicity.


The results indicated that consuming some fruits such as Averrhoa carambola, Ribes nigrum, Lycopersivon esculentum, Chaenomeles sinensis, and Syzygium samarangense could increase the hangover symptoms because they could decrease the activity of ALDH after drinking alcohol.


Mangifera indica and Durio zibethinus juices didn’t significantly affect the activities of ADH and ALDH in this study, while it was reported in the literature that Mangifera indica fruit could increase the activities of ADH and ALDH and Durio zibethinus fruit extracts inhibited yeast ALDH activity in vitro [12,31].

Methods: Students were recruited who consumed their usual quantity of any type of alcoholic beverage in their chosen company and then completed assessments of the effects the following day. The timing of drinking was restricted to the period between 22:00 and 02:00 h the night before testing as these are the most popular hours for consuming alcohol in the population under investigation. The testing included an assessment of mood and anxiety; testing was also performed after an evening of abstinence (no hangover condition), following a counterbalanced repeated measure design, with time of testing and order of testing as ‘between participant’ factors. Forty-eight student social drinkers (33 women, 15 men) aged between 18 and 43 years were tested, with a 1 week interval between test sessions. Results: Males reported consuming on average 14.7 units and females 10.5 units the night before testing. On the morning after alcohol consumption, ratings of alertness and tranquility were lower than the ratings the morning following an evening of abstinence at both 11:00 and 13:00 h and the post intoxication physical symptoms, emotional symptoms and symptoms of fatigue persisted throughout the morning. Conclusion: Heavy alcohol consumption lowers mood, disrupts sleep, increases anxiety and produces physical symptoms, emotional symptoms and symptoms of fatigue throughout the next morning.},

Since accelerated gastric emptying, decreased volume of distribution or delayed elimination could also result in higher blood alcohol levels, we investigated the effect of aspirin (1 g taken with a meal) on these parameters. Aspirin did not change the volume of ethanol distribution or the rate of its elimination. Moreover, it did not have a significant effect on gastric emptying. The half-time of 99mTc-DTPA loss was 65.5 ± 5.4 minutes without and 71.3 ± 6.5, with aspirin.

Transcription of the serotonin transporter gene is modulated by a polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR, near the promoter. 5-HTTLPR genotype has been associated with individual variation in emotion processing, brain structure, and brain function. We present an updated review of the biological literature on the serotonin transporter polymorphism. Recent imaging and behavioral studies of the role of 5-HTTLPR genotype in emotion processing are discussed in light of new biological findings related to 5-HTTLPR variation.

	abstract = {This study was to investigate the possibility of enhancing the anti-fibrotic effect by using a combination therapy with taurine, epigallocatechin gallate and genistein in a rat liver fibrosis model induced by alcohol, and to explore its underlying mechanism. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by intragastric administration with various amount of alcohol (5.0-9.5 g/kg) within 24 weeks in rats. The model group received alcohol only, and treatment groups received the corresponding drugs plus alcohol respectively, while the normal control group received an equal volume of saline. The antifibrotic effects of combination therapy were assessed directly by hepatic histology, and indirectly by measurement of serum biochemical markers, the fibrosis markers and related key cytokines/proteins. The results showed that combination therapy could significantly improve the liver function, as indicated by decreasing levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, combination therapy could effectively suppress the serum levels of fibrosis markers and hepatic hydroxyproline content, inhibit collagen deposition and reduce the pathological tissue damage. Research on mechanism showed that combination therapy was able to markedly reduce lipid peroxidation and recruit the anti-oxidative defense system, and inhibit the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2, α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor β(1) and small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 proteins. Our results showed that combination therapy is effective in attenuating hepatic injury and fibrosis in the alcohol-induced rat model. The improved efficacy of the combination therapy with its good safety profile could represent a new protective approach for liver fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Background:
Excessive alcohol consumption leads to liver disease. Interorgan crosstalk contributes to ethanol (EtOH)-induced liver injury. EtOH exposure causes gut dysbiosis resulting in negative alterations in intestinal fermentation byproducts, particularly decreased luminal butyrate concentrations. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated the effect of butyrate supplementation, in the form of trybutyrin, as a prophylactic treatment against EtOH-induced gut injury.

Methods:
C57BL/6J mice were treated with 3 different EtOH feeding protocols: chronic feeding (25 days, 32\% of kcal), short-term (2 days, 32\%), or acute single gavage (5 g/kg). Tributyrin (0.83 to 10 mM) was supplemented either into the liquid diet or by oral gavage. Intestinal expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and a butyrate receptor and transporter were evaluated, as well as liver enzymes and inflammatory markers.

Results:
All 3 EtOH exposure protocols reduced the expression and co-localization of TJ proteins (ZO-1, occludin) and the expression of a butyrate receptor (GPR109A) and transporter (SLC5A8) in the ileum and proximal colon. Importantly, tributyrin supplementation protected against these effects. Protection of the intestine with tributyrin supplementation was accompanied by mitigation of EtOH-induced increases in aspartate aminotransferase and inflammatory measures in the short-term and acute EtOH exposure protocols, but not after chronic EtOH feeding.

Conclusions:
These findings suggest that tributyrin supplementation could serve as a prophylactic treatment against gut injury caused by short-term EtOH exposure.},

	doi = {10.1177/0148607103027006396},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury causes significant morbidity and mortality. Protection against I/R injury may occur via preservation of tissue metabolism and ATP content, preservation of reduced glutathione, and stimulation of heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis. Supplementation with glutamine (GLN) has been reported to have beneficial effects on all of these protective pathways. Thus, we hypothesized that GLN pretreatment given to the rat in vivo would protect the myocardium against I/R-induced dysfunction.
METHODS: GLN (0.52 g/kg, intraperitoneally, given as alanine-glutamine dipeptide), alanine alone (0.23 g/kg), or a Ringer's lactate solution (control) was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 18 hours before heart excision, perfusion, exposure to global ischemia (15 minutes) and reperfusion (1 hour). Tissue metabolites were analyzed via magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
RESULTS: In control and alanine-treated animals, I/R injury resulted in cardiac dysfunction, indicated by a decrease in cardiac output. Administration of GLN 18 hours before I/R injury preserved cardiac output after reperfusion. Metabolic analysis of the myocardial tissue revealed that [/R injury led to significant diminution of myocardial tissue glutamate, ATP content, accumulation of myocardial lactate, and a reduction in reduced glutathione content in control animals. GLN significantly reduced the deleterious changes in myocardial metabolism and improved reduced glutathione content. No changes in pre- or post-I/R injury HSP expression were observed after GLN administration.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that remote in vivo administration of GLN before cardiac I/R injury can improve post-I/R cardiac function. This effect may be mediated via improved myocardial metabolism and enhanced reduced glutathione content.},

We investigated the effect of acute high dose alcohol consumption on systemic cytokine release. After an overnight fasting, alcohol-experienced healthy male volunteers (N = 20) aged 25–45 years were given oral ethanol in the form of vodka (4.28 mL/kg) which they drank over a period of 30 minutes reaching peak blood alcohol concentration of 0.12\% (SD 0.028). Blood samples were obtained prior to alcohol intake as well as 2, 7, and 12 hours thereafter. Serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, MCP-1, and TNF-α were determined by the multibead-based assay. Baseline cytokine levels were not related to BMI, hepatic parameters, electrolytes, glucose, or morning cortisol levels. Within 2 hours of alcohol intake, levels of IL-1Ra were elevated and remained so throughout the assessment period (p for trend = 0.015). In contrast, the levels of the chemokine MCP-1 dropped acutely followed by steadily increasing levels during the observation period (p {\textless} 0.001). The impact of sustained elevated levels of MCP-1 even after the clearance of blood alcohol content deserves attention.},

Findings from this study are in line with a handful of human studies that have been previously conducted examining direct effects of alcohol intoxication on cytokine response.


We demonstrate postalcohol induction of inflammatory cytokine MCP-1 in vivo within hours following an apparently acute fall in value that corresponds with opposing changes in IL-1Ra which has an anti-inflammatory effect.


Not only binge does drinking in healthy individuals rapidly increase serum LPS through compromised gut wall integrity but also the same dose of LPS ex vivo can induce production of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 [8].


In the context of heavy drinking, LPS-induced production of the cytokines TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-1β are potentiated [12]. A high degree of correlation between the MCP-1, a proinflammatory chemokine, and IL-1Ra, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, on both experimental days indicates that, under physiological conditions, a balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory state is maintained.
},
	annote = {
In summary, this study demonstrates that binge drinking provokes an early cytokine response favoring anti-inflammatory state, as indicated by elevated IL-1Ra levels, followed by a gradual change towards the baseline levels, which are not attained even when ethanol is fully eliminated from the blood. On the contrary, the levels of the proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 increased after initial drop and remained higher than baseline levels at 12-hour follow-up.

	abstract = {Although ascorbate has long been known to stimulate dietary iron (Fe) absorption and non-transferrin Fe uptake, the role of ascorbate in transferrin Fe uptake is unknown. Transferrin is a serum Fe transport protein supplying almost all cellular Fe under physiological conditions. We sought to examine ascorbate's role in this process, particularly as cultured cells are typically ascorbate-deficient. At typical plasma concentrations, ascorbate significantly increased 59Fe uptake from transferrin by 1.5–2-fold in a range of cells. Moreover, ascorbate enhanced ferritin expression and increased 59Fe accumulation in ferritin. The lack of effect of cycloheximide or the cytosolic aconitase inhibitor, oxalomalate, on ascorbate-mediated 59Fe uptake from transferrin indicate increased ferritin synthesis or cytosolic aconitase activity was not responsible for ascorbate's activity. Experiments with membrane-permeant and -impermeant ascorbate-oxidizing reagents indicate that while extracellular ascorbate is required for stimulation of 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-citrate, only intracellular ascorbate is needed for transferrin 59Fe uptake. Additionally, experiments with l-ascorbate analogs indicate ascorbate's reducing ene-diol moiety is necessary for its stimulatory activity. Importantly, neither N-acetylcysteine nor buthionine sulfoximine, which increase or decrease intracellular glutathione, respectively, affected transferrin-dependent 59Fe uptake. Thus, ascorbate's stimulatory effect is not due to a general increase in cellular reducing capacity. Ascorbate also did not affect expression of transferrin receptor 1 or 125I-transferrin cellular flux. However, transferrin receptors, endocytosis, vacuolar-type ATPase activity and endosomal acidification were required for ascorbate's stimulatory activity. Therefore, ascorbate is a novel modulator of the classical transferrin Fe uptake pathway, acting via an intracellular reductive mechanism.},

One hundred nine alcoholic patients, aged 22–81 years (mean ± SEM, 52.0 ± 1.3 years), and 21 healthy volunteers, aged 41–79 years (51.2 ± 2.2 years), participated in this study. Plasma PCOOH was measured by HPLC with chemiluminescence detection. Plasma PCOOH concentration was significantly higher in alcoholic patients (46.1 ± 4.1 pmol/ml) than in controls (15.6 ± 1.8 pmol/ml). It was significantly higher in patients with blood alcohol (88.0 ± 10.5 pmol/ml) than in those without alcohol (32.6 ± 3.1 pmol/ml). The patients with high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), and triglyceride (TG) showed significantly higher PCOOH concentrations than did patients with normal levels. The PCOOH level was positively correlated with levels of γ-GTP, HDL, blood alcohol concentration, and TG. Plasma PCOOH levels in 29 alcoholic patients after a 6 week abstinence were decreased significantly (22.8 ± 11.1 pmol/ml), which was associated with improvement on liver function tests. This is the first measurement of plasma PCOOH in alcoholic patients.
These results suggest the involvement of lipid peroxidation in alcohol-induced liver damage and confirm that the PCOOH plasma concentration is a new marker of alcohol consumption as well as oxidative stress in alcoholic patients.},

Glutamine (GLN) plays a role in maintenance of intestinal barrier function in various animal models and critically ill humans. Recent evidence from intestinal cell monolayers indicates that GLN maintains transepithelial resistance and decreases permeability. The mechanisms of these effects remain undefined. We hypothesized that GLN affects proteins involved in the intercellular junctional complex. GLN availability was controlled in Caco-2 monolayers by addition to the medium and treatment with methionine sulfoximine (MSO) to inhibit glutamine synthetase (GS). Expression of TJ proteins, claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occluden (ZO)-1 was measured by immunoblotting. Localization of TJ proteins was evaluated by immunofluorescence light microscopy. Structure of TJ was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Deprivation of GLN decreased claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 protein expression and caused a disappearance of perijunctional claudin-1 and a reduction of occludin but had no effect on ZO-1. TEM revealed that MSO-treated cells in the absence of GLN formed irregular junctional complexes between the apical lateral margins of adjoining cells. These findings indicate that TJ protein expression and cellular localization in Caco-2 cell monolayers rely on GLN. This mechanism may similarly relate to GLN-mediated modulation of intestinal barrier function in stressed animals and humans.},

The secondary outcome was self assessment of intoxication related symptoms (self confidence, urge to speak, and number of spontaneous hugs), scored on a scale of 0 to 10., Results Plasma ethanol concentrations were below the detection limit of 2.2 mmol/L (10 mg/100 mL) throughout the experiment. No significant changes were observed in the intoxication related symptoms, although self confidence and urge to speak increased slightly at the start of the study, probably due to the setup., Conclusion Our results suggest that feet are impenetrable to the alcohol component of vodka.

	abstract = {The study of rapid changes in brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) is of increasing interest in neuroimaging. Brain states departing from normal waking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the aforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by psilocybin (a substance found in “magic mushrooms”) is characterized by unconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time, space and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of these effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic experience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain activity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during and after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo. Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) temporal variability was assessed computing the variance and total spectral power, resulting in increased signal variability bilaterally in the hippocampi and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in BOLD signal spectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively higher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control, and dorsal attention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different connectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a wider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control conditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of the effects of psilocybin on dynamical behavior in the human brain at a macroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the unconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic state.

Here we show that fructose, at a dose of 1 g/kg, fulfills the criteria for such an agent. When ingested by healthy volunteers who had imbibed ethanol equivalent to 8 standard tots, it reduced the time required to attain a legal blood alcohol level (50 mg\%) by approximately 70 min ( n = 9). When ingested before a dose of alcohol equivalent to a double tot, fructose reduced both the magnitude and duration of the subsequent increase in blood alcohol; mean peak height, area under the curve, and time taken to reach zero were 39\%, 32\% and 51\%, respectively, of that observed in the absence of fructose ( n = 12).

	abstract = {Alcohol misuse and addiction is a worldwide problem causing enormous individual suffering as well as financial costs for the society. To develop pharmacological means to reduce suffering, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of ethanol in the brain. Ethanol is known to increase extracellular levels of both dopamine and taurine in the nucleus accumbens (nAc), a part of the brain reward system, but the two events have not been connected. In previous studies we have demonstrated that glycine receptors in the nAc are involved in modulating both basal- and ethanol-induced dopamine output in the same brain region. By means of in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats we here demonstrate that the endogenous glycine receptor ligand taurine mimics ethanol in activating the brain reward system. Furthermore, administration of systemic ethanol diluted in an isotonic (0.9\% NaCl) or hypertonic (3.6\% NaCl) saline solution was investigated with respect to extracellular levels of taurine and dopamine in the nAc. We found that ethanol given in a hypertonic solution, contrary to an isotonic solution, failed to increase concentrations of both taurine and dopamine in the nAc. However, a modest, non-dopamine elevating concentration of taurine in the nAc disclosed a dopamine elevating effect of systemic ethanol also when given in a hypertonic solution. We conclude that the elevations of taurine and dopamine in the nAc are closely related and that in order for ethanol to induce dopamine release, a simultaneous increase of extracellular taurine levels in the nAc is required. These data also -provide support for the notion that the nAc is the primary target for ethanol in its dopamine-activating effect after systemic administration and that taurine is a prominent participant in activating the brain reward system.},

However, as the applications of heat storage widen, from micro-electronics thermal control to concentrated solar heat storage and vehicle thermal management, and even for chemical reactor isothermalization, the challenges facing heat storage increasingly are moving from those associated with the ‘standard' diurnal storage, in itself a problem for low thermal conductivity materials, to response times measured in a few hours or even minutes. While high thermal conductivity metals such as foams can be impregnated with a PCM, for example, to increase local conductivity, the rapid heat input and removal necessitates a more radical approach—heat pipes, possibly with feedback control, with innovative PCM interfaces. This paper reviews the use of heat pipes in conventional and rapid response PCM and liquid or cold storage applications and introduces some novel concepts that might overcome current limitations.},

The specific type of brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (mRCC) that are adversely affected by alcohol abuse has not been studied. Thus, we examined the alterations of mRCC in freshly isolated mitochondria from mice brain that were pair-fed the ethanol (4\% v/v) and control liquid diets for 7–8 weeks. We observed that alcohol intake severely reduced the levels of complex I and V. A reduction in complex I was associated with a decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cPT1) and cPT2 levels. The mitochondrial outer (cPT1) and inner (cPT2) membrane transporter enzymes are specialized in acylation of fatty acid from outer to inner membrane of mitochondria for ATP production. Thus, our results showed that alterations of cPT1 and cPT2 paralleled a decrease β-oxidation of palmitate and ATP production, suggesting that impairment of substrate entry step (complex I function) can cause a negative impact on ATP production (complex V function). Disruption of cPT1/cPT2 was accompanied by an increase in cytochrome C leakage, while reduction of complex I and V paralleled a decrease in depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ, monitored by JC-1 fluorescence) and ATP production in alcohol intake. We noted that acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC, a cofactor of cPT1 and cPT2) prevented the adverse effects of alcohol while coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was not very effective against alcohol insults. These results suggest that understanding the molecular, biochemical, and signaling mechanisms of the CNS mitochondrial β-oxidation such as ALC can mitigate alcohol related neurological disorders.},

Although carnitine retards ethanol oxidation in the intact animal, the in vitro activities of ethainol-metabolizing enzymes remain unaltered. Therefore, hepatocytes were targeted to understand the mechanism of carnitine effect on ethanol metabolism. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase-perfusion technique and incubated in albumin-containing medium with ethanol in the presence or absence of added carnitine or related compounds. Ethanol oxidation was determined by the loss of ethanol as well as by the products formed. The rate of ethanol oxidation in the presence of carnitine was one-half the rate in the absence of carnitine (14 vs. 25 nmol · min−1 · million−1 cells). It took 100 times the concentration of carnitine to equal the maximal inhibition produced by acetylcarnitine and the effect of acetylcanitine was without a lag time.

"C a r n i t i n e inhibited ethanol metabolism at wide ranges of ethanol (0.1-10 mmol. l) and hepatocyte (0.25-2 million cells • ml -{\textasciitilde}) concentrations (data nott shown)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"T h u s , L-acetylcarnitine was 100-fold stronger inhibitor of ethanol metabolism than carnitine." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"T h e metabolism of ethanol was determined by the rate of ethanol disappearance from the medium as well as by the products of ethanol oxidation" (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"T h e r e f o r e , the major impact of carnitine or acetylcarnitin inhibition was in terms of CO2 produced. rms of CO2 produced. ms of CO2 produced." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
Therefore,.the major impact of carnitine or acetylcarnitine inhibition was in terms of CO2 produced. (note on p.292)
 
"A small but consistent decrease in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the presence of carnitine and acetylcarnitine is noteworthy" (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"T h e decrease in oxidation rate of ethanol in isolated hepatocytes is most likely due to the loss of shuttle intermediates during hepatocyte preparation because addition of malate and/or lactate is known to restore the ethanol oxidation rates in isolated hepatocytes equal to that found in the intact liver (7,16). Because shuttle intermediates were not replaced in the incubation mixture of these studies, their impact on the carnitine/acetylcarnitine inhibition cannot bee evaluated in a direct manner." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"C a r n i t i n e inhibited ethanol oxidation in hepatocytes, which is consistent with the observations in the intact rat (26)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"T h e m a g n i t u d e of inhibition of ethanol metabolism was about 5007o in isolated hepatocytes and about 30070 in the intact animal (20,25)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:292)
"p h a s e in carnitine inhibition (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the 32-h lag time we observed in intact animal (26)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
There was a distinct lag phase in carnitine inhibition (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the 32-h lag time we observed in intact animal (26). (note on p.293)
 
"I n thee later, about 32 h of carnitirte supplementation was essentiaa before a significant inhibition of ethanol metabolism could bee seen. Simultaneous administration of carnitine with ethanol had no apparent effect on ethanol metabolism (26)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"e q u i m o l a r concentrations of choline were equally effective in decreasing ethanol oxidation (Table 1)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"I n t h e intact rat, inhibition of ethanol metabolism by choline was not significant (27)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"T h e m o s t important finding was that at equimolar concentrations acetylcarnitine was a far better inhibitor of ethanol metabolism than carnitine in hepatocytes (Table 1)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"a c e t y l c a r n i t i n e effect is immediate and remains steady for all practical purposes, as a rate change of 10-1507\% over a inhibitor concentration change of 100-fold can hardly be considered significant" (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"A b o u t 950/0 of ethanol was oxidized to CO2 and the re-- mainder was found as acetaldehyde, acetyl-CoA, acetylcarni tine, and lipids, etc. (Table 3). Carnitine and acetylcarnitin reduced these products 20\% and 40\%, respectively" (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"I t has been shown, since then, that acetylcarnitine, not carnitine, inhibits in vitro activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (28)." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)
"A dose-response study revealed about 84\% inhibition by 0.2/{\textasciitilde}mol • I acetylcarnitine or 20/{\textasciitilde}mol • 1 carnitine (Table 2).." (Cha and Sachan 1995:293)},

Behaviorally, agmatine exerts antidepressant-like effects. The enzyme agmatinase degrades agmatine. The gene coding for human agmatinase is located on chromosome 1p36, a gene locus which has been linked to bipolar disorder and major depression, but the enzyme has not yet been studied in the context of neuropsychiatric diseases. We analyzed agmatinase protein expression in postmortem hippocampi of individuals with affective disorders. Data from eleven patients with mood disorders (unipolar and bipolar depression) and twelve matched control cases were compared by immunocytochemical and morphometrical analysis. Agmatinase protein was detected in a subset of hippocampal interneurons. The protein was localized to perikarya, neurites and putative nerve endings contacting hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. The number and the numerical density of agmatinase-immunopositive cell bodies were strongly elevated in depressive patients. In addition, a significantly increased density of agmatinase-immunoreactive punctate profiles was observed in the CA(4) region in unipolar and bipolar depression. The reported increased expression of agmatinase suggests a functional relevance of the enzyme in the pathophysiology of human affective disorders.

Both hangover and performance deficits have been documented the day after drinking to intoxication after breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) has returned to near zero. But few studies have examined the relationship between hangover and post-intoxication performance.

Method
We performed secondary analyses of data from a previously reported controlled cross-over laboratory study to assess the relationship of hangover incidence and severity to sustained attention/reaction time the morning after drinking to about 0.11 g\% BrAC. Relationships were investigated while controlling for gender, type of alcoholic beverage (bourbon or vodka), and neurocognitive performance after placebo.

Results
Hangover severity and neurocognitive performance were significantly correlated. Participants reporting stronger hangover were more impaired than those reporting little or no hangover. Comparing any to no hangover showed a trend in the same direction of effect.

Conclusions
More intense hangover may indicate less fitness for duty in workers in certain safety-sensitive occupations, with implications for occupational alcohol policies.},

	abstract = {Because of the significant morbidity and lethality caused by alcoholic liver disease (ALD), there remains a need to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent and treat ALD. Towards this goal, minimally invasive biomarker discovery represents an outstanding approach for these purposes. The mechanisms underlying ALD include hepatic lipid accumulation. As the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) has been shown to inhibit steatosis, the present study examined the role of PPARβ/δ in ALD coupling metabolomic, biochemical and molecular biological analyses. Wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice were fed either a control or 4\% ethanol diet and examined after 4–7 months of treatment. Ethanol fed Pparβ/δ-null mice exhibited steatosis after short-term treatment compared to controls, the latter effect appeared to be due to increased activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). The wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice fed the control diet showed clear differences in their urinary metabolomic profiles. In particular, metabolites associated with arginine and proline metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism, were markedly different between genotypes suggesting a constitutive role for PPARβ/δ in the metabolism of these amino acids. Interestingly, urinary excretion of taurine was present in ethanol-fed wild-type mice but markedly lower in similarly treated Pparβ/δ-null mice. Evidence suggests that PPARβ/δ modulates pyridoxal kinase activity by altering Km, consistent with the observed decreased in urinary taurine excretion. These data collectively suggest that PPARβ/δ prevents ethanol-induced hepatic effects by inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis, modulation of amino acid metabolism, and altering pyridoxal kinase activity.},

	abstract = {Background
This study assessed the effects of heavy drinking with high or low congener beverages on next-day neurocognitive performance, and the extent to which these effects were mediated by alcohol-related sleep disturbance or alcoholic beverage congeners, and correlated with the intensity of hangover.

Methods
Healthy heavy drinkers age 21–33 (n = 95) participated in two drinking nights after an acclimatization night. They drank to a mean of 0.11 g\% BrAC on vodka or bourbon one night with matched placebo the other night, randomized for type and order. Polysomnography recordings were made overnight; self-report and neurocognitive measures were assessed the next morning.

Results
After alcohol, people had more hangover and more decrements in tests requiring both sustained attention and speed. Hangover correlated with poorer performance on these measures. Alcohol decreased sleep efficiency and REM sleep, and increased wake time and next-day sleepiness. Alcohol effects on sleep correlated with hangover but did not mediate the effects on performance. No effect of beverage congeners was found except on hangover severity, with people feeling worse after bourbon. Virtually no sex differences appeared.

Conclusions
Since drinking to this level affects complex cognitive abilities, safety could be affected, with implications for driving and for safety sensitive occupations. Congener content affects only how people feel the next day so does not increase risk. The sleep disrupting effects of alcohol did not account for the impaired performance so other mechanisms of effect need to be sought. Since hangover symptoms correlate with impaired performance, these might be contributing to the impairment.},

The species were selected to represent different patterns of metabolism in fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelia. Vegetative mycelium of P. cubensis was characterized by a relatively high soluble nitrogen component and by the capacity to accumulate psilocybin and psilocin under selected conditions. The closely related P. cyanescens was less responsive to variations in phosphate nutrient and lacked the capacity to accumulate appreciable quantities of soluble nitrogenous compounds or detectable quantities of key tryptamines. P. campanulatus grown in phosphate-rich media appeared to have an adequate free amino acid pool and to excrete some exocellular nitrogen metabolites during longer incubation periods; no 5-hydroxytryptamine derivatives were detected in cultures of this fungus.},

	abstract = {The discovery that mammalian cells have the ability to synthesize the free radical nitric oxide (NO) has stimulated an extraordinary impetus for scientific research in all the fields of biology and medicine. Since its early description as an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, NO has emerged as a fundamental signaling device regulating virtually every critical cellular function, as well as a potent mediator of cellular damage in a wide range of conditions. Recent evidence indicates that most of the cytotoxicity attributed to NO is rather due to peroxynitrite, produced from the diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and another free radical, the superoxide anion. Peroxynitrite interacts with lipids, DNA, and proteins via direct oxidative reactions or via indirect, radical-mediated mechanisms. These reactions trigger cellular responses ranging from subtle modulations of cell signaling to overwhelming oxidative injury, committing cells to necrosis or apoptosis. In vivo, peroxynitrite generation represents a crucial pathogenic mechanism in conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, diabetes, circulatory shock, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, novel pharmacological strategies aimed at removing peroxynitrite might represent powerful therapeutic tools in the future. Evidence supporting these novel roles of NO and peroxynitrite is presented in detail in this review.},

	abstract = {Background: The enhanced vulnerability of women to develop alcohol-related diseases may be due to their higher blood alcohol levels after drinking, but the mechanism for this effect is debated. 
Methods: Sixty-five healthy volunteers of both genders drank 0.3 g of ethanol/kg of body weight (as 5\%, 10\%, or 40\% solutions) postprandially. Blood alcohol concentrations were monitored by breath analysis and compared with those after intravenous infusion of the same dose. First-pass metabolism was quantified (using Michaelis-Menten kinetics) as the route-dependent difference in the amount of ethanol reaching the systemic blood.  Gastric  emptying  was  assessed  by  nuclear  scanning  after  intake of  300 m Curie  of technetium-labeled diethylene triamine pentacetic acid in 10\% ethanol. The activities of alcohol dehydro- genase isozymes were assessed in 58 gastric biopsies, using preferred substrates for g -ADH (acetaldehyde) and for s -ADH ( m -nitrobenzaldehyde) and a specific reaction of x -ADH (glutathione-dependent formal- dehyde dehydrogenase). Results: Women had less first-pass metabolism than men when given 10\% or 40\%, but not 5\%, alcohol. This was associated with lower gastric x -ADH activity; its low affinity for ethanol could explain the greater gender  difference  in  first-pass  metabolism  with high  rather  than  with  low  concentrations  of  imbibed alcohol. Alcohol gastric emptying was 42\% slower and hepatic oxidation was 10\% higher in women. A 7.3\% smaller volume of alcohol distribution contributed to the higher ethanol levels in women, but it did not account for the route-dependent effects.

Conclusions: The gender difference in alcohol levels is due mainly to a smaller gastric metabolism in females (because of a significantly lesser activity of x -ADH), rather than to differences in gastric emptying or  in  hepatic  oxidation of  ethanol.  The  concentration-dependency  of  these  effects  may  explain earlier discrepancies. The combined pharmacokinetic differences may increase the vulnerability of women to the effects of ethanol.},

In both genders, alcohol levels were higher after intra- venous infusion than after oral consumption of the same dose (Fig. 1).The major gender difference was found after oral administration; although there were no gender differ- ences in the peak alcohol levels (25.3 +- 1.3 mg/dl in women vs. 25.6 +- 2.1, in men), high ethanol levels persisted longer in women than in men. This resulted in a 47\% greater AUC after oral ethanol in women than in men (45.9 +- 3.4 mg/dl 3 h vs. 31.2 +- 7; p , 0.01). By contrast, the AUC after intravenous administration were similar in both genders (58.4 +- 3.3 vs. 53.7 +- 3.3).The difference between the intravenous and oral amounts (namely, the first pass metabolism) was significantly smaller in women than in men (35.6 +- 7.4 mg/kg body weight vs. 72.9 +- 8.9; p {\textless} 0.002).In women, half of the gastric radioactivity (T50\%) left the stomach in 73 +- 8 min compared with 51 +- 3 min in men ( p {\textless} 0.02).Measurement of the activities of the three major gastric isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase showed a significantly (p {\textless} 0.003) lower chi-ADH activity in women than in men (Fig. 3), as judged by the activity of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde oxidation. There were no significant gender differences in sigma-ADH activity (assessed by the reduction of m-nitrobenzaldehyde) and in gamma-ADH activity (assessed by the reduction of acetaldehyde).In the present study, this gender difference resulted in 47\% larger areas under the curve (AUC) of blood alcohol concentra- tions in women than in men after oral, but not after intra- venous, administration of the dose (Fig. 1).We confirmed the observation by others (Dubowski 1976; Mishra et al., 1989) that the rate of ethanol oxidation, a function predominantly exerted by the liver, is faster in women than in men. In the present study, the maximal rate of elimination (VMAX) was 10\% higher in women than in men.By using this method, the route-dependent difference or FPM in women was about half of that in men ( p , 0.002), a gender change sufficiently large to account for the gender differences in blood alcohol levels.Conversely, the gender differences in FPM correlated with total gastric ADH activity at 500 mM of ethanol (Frezza et al., 1990), a concentration likely to occur in the stomach (Halsted et al., 1973), whereas minimal or no differences were found at concentrations similar to those in blood (Moreno et al., 1994; Thuluvath et al., 1994).The gastric mucosa expresses three classes of ADH isozymes in a decreasing order of affinity for ethanol: gamma-ADH, a class I isozyme also present in the liver, sigma-ADH, a class IV ADH characteristic of the upper digestive tract, and chi-ADH, a class III isozyme found in most tissues. we found a 58\% reduction in class III (or chi -) ADH activity in women compared with men (Fig. 3), Women’s significant decrease in FPM (observed above with 10\% ethanol, equivalent to wine) was reproduced in an additional group with 40\% (equivalent to hard liquors) but not with 5\% ethanol (equivalent to beers; Fig. 4). This finding is opposite to that previously found in ethnic groups differing in sigma-ADH activity (Dohmen et al., 1996), which has a much smaller KM.In both genders, the rate of gastric emptying decreases and the FPM increases by raising the imbibed ethanol concentration (Roine et al., 1991), but there is no evidence that this inhibitory effect of ethanol concentration is greater in male than in female subjects.In the present study, the volume of alcohol distribution in women was 7.3\% lower than in men, a difference too small to account for the changes in alcohol levels.

	abstract = {Background
Isoflavone administration in the form of a purified extract from the herbal medication kudzu root has been shown to reduce, but not eliminate, alcohol consumption in alcohol-abusing and alcohol-dependent men. The precise mechanism of this action is unknown, but one possible explanation for these results is that the isoflavones in kudzu might actually increase the intensity or duration of alcohol’s effects and thus delay the desire for subsequent drinks. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.

Methods
Twelve (12) healthy adult men and women (27.5±1.89 yrs old) who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol (7.8±0.63 drinks/week) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which they were treated with either kudzu extract (total isoflavone dose of 750 mg/day) or matched placebo for nine days. On days 8 and 9, participants received an acute challenge of ethyl alcohol (either 0.35 or 0.7 g/kg alcohol). During the challenges the following measures were collected: subjective effects, psychomotor (body sway), cognitive performance (vigilance/reaction time), physiological measures (heart rate and skin temperature), and plasma ethanol concentration.

Results
Alcohol resulted in a dose-related alteration in subjective measures of intoxication, impairment of stance stability, and vigilance/reaction time. Kudzu extract did not alter participants’ subjective responses to the alcohol challenge or to alcohol’s effects on stance stability or vigilance/reaction time. However, individuals treated with kudzu extract experienced a slightly more rapid rise in plasma ethanol levels, but only after the 0.7 g/kg dose. This transient effect during the first 30 minutes of the ascending plasma alcohol curve lasted only 10-15 minutes; there were no differences in peak plasma alcohol levels or alcohol elimination kinetics. Additionally, kudzu pretreatment enhanced the effects of the 0.7 g/kg dose of alcohol on heart rate and skin temperature.

Conclusions
These data suggest that individuals who drink alcohol while being treated with kudzu extract experience no adverse consequences and further, the reported reductions in alcohol intake after kudzu extract treatment are not related to an alteration in alcohol’s subjective or psychomotor effects.},

Dietary methyl donor supplements such as SAM and betaine mitigate ALI in animal models; however, the mechanisms of protection remain elusive. It has been suggested that methyl donors may act via attenuation of alcohol-induced oxidative stress. We hypothesized that the protective action of methyl donors is mediated by an effect on the oxidative metabolism of alcohol in the liver. Male C57BL/6J mice were administered a control high-fat diet or diet enriched in methyl donors with or without alcohol for 4 weeks using the enteral alcohol feeding model. As expected, attenuation of ALI and an increase in reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione ratio were achieved with methyl donor supplementation. Interestingly, methyl donors led to a 35\% increase in blood alcohol elimination rate, and while there was no effect on alcohol metabolism in the stomach, a profound effect on liver alcohol metabolism was observed. The catalase-dependent pathway of alcohol metabolism was induced, yet the increase in CYP2E1 activity by alcohol was blunted, which may be mitigating production of oxidants. Additional factors contributing to the protective effects of methyl donors in ALI were increased activity of low- and high-Km aldehyde dehydrogenases leading to lower hepatic acetaldehyde, maintenance of the efficient mitochondrial energy metabolism, and promotion of peroxisomal β-oxidation. Profound changes in alcohol metabolism represent additional important mechanism of the protective effect of methyl donors in ALI.},

Subjects were assigned to one of four treatment groups (bromelain 300 mg t.i.d., ibuprofen 400 mg t.i.d., placebo t.i.d., and control) and began treatment immediately following the exercise protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: No differences among treatments were observed for any of the dependent variables at any time. ROM deficits and pain peaked between 48 and 72 hours. Peak torque deficiencies were observed between 24 and 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of bromelain and ibuprofen had no effect on elbow flexor pain, loss of ROM, or loss of concentric peak torque as a result of an eccentric exercise regimen.},

	abstract = {Endogenous polyamines like spermine are known to have four distinct effects on recombinant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels: voltage-dependent inhibition, glycine-dependent stimulation, glycine-independent stimulation and decreased affinity to the agonist (l-glutamate). These effects are highly dependent on the constituting epsilon subunits (epsilon1-epsilon4) of the recombinant NMDA receptor channels. Agmatine reportedly inhibits native NMDA receptor channels in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the present investigation, the effects of agmatine on the epsilon/zeta heteromeric NMDA receptor channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were examined using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Agmatine inhibited the four epsilon/zeta (epsilon1/zeta1, epsilon2/zeta1, epsilon3/zeta1 and epsilon4/zeta1) channels with similar sensitivity (an IC50 value of about 300microM at -70mV). This effect was dependent on the membrane potential and was more pronounced at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (voltage-dependent inhibition). Agmatine did not exhibit other stimulatory (glycine-dependent and -independent effects) or inhibitory (decreased affinity to l-glutamate) effects. These properties are similar to the pharmacological profile of well-characterized NMDA receptor channel blockers like phencyclidine and ketamine. Thus, regarding the effects on the NMDA receptor channels, agmatine is not like other endogenous polyamines rather it acts as a channel blocker.},

	abstract = {The mixed serotonin (5-HT) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose-dependently induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self. The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20 mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3 mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 µg/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p\&lt;0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both. The data suggest that the modulation of 5-HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {Background
Epidemiologic studies have shown that individuals who consume low to moderate alcohol have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to abstainers. Although experimental studies confirmed this observation, the effect of alcohol on ischemic myocardium is still unclear. We developed a clinically relevant animal model of chronic myocardial ischemia to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on the myocardium.

Study Design
Fourteen Yorkshire swine underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. Postoperatively, one group was supplemented with 90mL 50\% ethanol daily (ETOH n=7), and one group was supplemented with 80g of sucrose daily to normalize caloric intake between groups (SUC n=7). After 7 weeks, all animals underwent sternotomy, and harvest of the chronically ischemic myocardium and non-ischemic myocardium. Tissues were analyzed for protein expression and stained for apoptosis quantification.

Results
In the ischemic myocardium, alcohol down-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins TNFα, FOX03, BAD and caspase 9, up-regulated pro-survival proteins AMPK, pAMPK and pFOX03, and down regulated MTOR signaling by down regulating MTOR, pMTOR and up-regulating Deptor. In the non-ischemic myocardium, alcohol up-regulated pro-survival proteins AKT, pAKT, pBCL2, AMPK, pBAD, pFOX03 and down regulated MTOR signaling by down regulating pMTOR and up-regulating Deptor. Alcohol also decreased cell death as measured by TUNEL staining in the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium.

Conclusions
Alcohol consumption down regulates apoptosis and promotes cell survival in the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium. Alcohol also modulates MTOR signaling, which regulates senescence and apoptosis. Perhaps MTOR and apoptosis regulation is another mechanism by which moderate ethanol consumption is cardioprotective.},

	abstract = {Methylene blue (MB) delays cellular senescence, induces complex-IV, and activates Keap1/Nrf2; however, the molecular link of these effects to MB is unclear. Since MB is redox-active, we investigated its effect on the NAD/NADH ratio in IMR90 cells. The transient increase in NAD/NADH observed in MB-treated cells triggered an investigation of the energy regulator AMPK. MB induced AMPK phosphorylation in a transient pattern, which was followed by the induction of PGC1α and SURF1: both are inducers of mitochondrial and complex-IV biogenesis. Subsequently MB-treated cells exhibited {\textgreater}100\% increase in complex-IV activity and a 28\% decline in cellular oxidants. The telomeres erosion rate was also significantly lower in MB-treated cells. A previous research suggested that the pattern of AMPK activation (i.e., chronic or transient) determines the AMPK effect on cell senescence. We identified that the anti-senescence activity of MB (transient activator) was 8-times higher than that of AICAR (chronic activator). Since MB lacked an effect on cell cycle, an MB-dependent change to cell cycle is unlikely to contribute to the anti-senescence activity. The current findings in conjunction with the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 suggest a synchronized activation of the energy and cellular defense pathways as a possible key factor in MB's potent anti-senescence activity.,

This damage is related to the ethanol oxidation in the brain. The metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetate is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species that accentuate the oxidative state of cells. This metabolism of ethanol can induce the oxidation of the fatty acids in phospholipids, and the bioactive aldehydes produced are known to be associated with neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. As such, here we will review the role of lipids in the neuronal damage induced by ethanol-related oxidative stress and the role that lipids play in the related compensatory or defense mechanisms.},

Ethanol-induced lipoperoxidation by oxidative stress [142] and its products decrease the intracellular reduced glutathione and increase its oxidized form [148].


ethanol-induced oxidative stress provokes a loss of [cardiolipin] [152, 154–157] in conjunction with the appearance of HNE [157, 158].


Interestingly, the neurodegeneration induced by ethanol can be prevented by an inhibitor of PLA2 in vitro [153, 161].


Meanwhile, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: 22:6n-3) prevents neuronal apoptosis by promoting PS accumulation [162], while conversely, PLA2 activity and oxidation-mediated HNE production may diminish the levels of PS.


The expression of serine palmitoyltransferase was localized in neurons and it was enhanced in caspase 3-positive neurons induced by ethanol [172], indicating that de novo ceramide synthesis participates in ethanol-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain.


nterestingly, CerS6 is enhanced within hours of ethanol withdrawal as a compensatory effect [176].

For example, there is more cholesterol in neuron membranes exposed to ethanol [155].


Hence, an increase in the cholesterol present in membranes may represent a compensatory mechanism to combat ethanol damage.

In adults, the ethanol ingested is almost completely and instantly absorbed by passive diffusion, reaching a peak concentration in humans between 30 and 90 min.


Solid food intake can reduce the ethanol absorption rate by 30\% and it has been suggested that this effect is due to the need for food digestion prior to absorption process.


As such, if food is taken in as a liquid then it would not produce this effect [49, 54].


Moreover, a small amount of ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) classes I and IV [52, 55] in the stomach and intestine. This acetaldehyde can be absorbed along with ethanol and metabolized by the liver or other tissues.


Absorption is more efficient in the small intestine than in stomach [49], a difference in absorption that is due to two factors.

In the CNS, it can be found in microsomes [133] and it has been shown that, in acute ethanol poisoning, there is an increase of catalase activity in the cytosol, microsomes, and synaptosomes, as well as a reduction in the mitochondria of the rat CNS [131].


This increase in catalase activity in the CNS may be adaptive processes induced by the increase in the hydrogen peroxide generated, as what occurs in the CNS of animals exposed to high concentrations of ethanol [134].


Increased SOD activity is considered to be an adaptive response to oxidative stress, such as that induced by acute ethanol toxicity in the cerebral cortex [132]. However, acute ethanol intoxication reduces the activity of Cu, Zn-SOD in the cytosolic and microsomal fraction of the rat brain, and Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria [131].


In the rat and human CNS, the greatest glutathione peroxidase activity is observed in the gray and white matter of the cerebral cortex [137, 138].

Most first pass metabolism occurs in the liver [49, 55] and the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by proteins of the ADH family [56], of which class I (ADH1) and III (ADH3) enzymes metabolize ethanol in the liver [57, 58].


Consequently ADH3 plays a more important role in the metabolism of alcohol at high concentrations. In addition, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) and catalase contribute to the metabolism of alcohol in specific circumstances, such as high ethanol concentrations [48, 60].


The acetaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethanol is thereafter transformed to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [61], which can be further metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy, or these metabolites can be deposited in the plasma [62, 63].

Most GRed activity is found in neurons and glial cells [139], and acute ethanol poisoning significantly dampens GRed activity in the cerebral cortex [140].


The most important exogenous antioxidant in the CNS is vitamin E, and both vitamin E and vitamin C content in the CNS falls after ethanol consumption, whereas vitamin A content increases [131].

The distribution of ethanol throughout the body is driven in direct proportion to water content of each tissue, especially at the ethanol steady-state.


Since the blood flow to the brain remains relatively constant, changes in the blood concentration of ethanol are the most relevant factor influencing the amount of ethanol delivered to the brain and therefore for the different levels of brain intoxication [78–80].


although metabolites of ethanol, like acetate, can also reach the brain as products of first pass metabolism [85].


Recently, the metabolism of [2-(13)C]-ethanol was evaluated in the brains of rats, and products such as labeled acetate, glutamate, glutamine, and GABA were detected found [86].
},
	annote = {
The oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde can occur in the brain through pathways that involve catalase, cytochrome CYP2E1, and ADH.
 Indeed, acetaldehyde production in the brain in vivo depends on catalase activity [85, 93] and catalase appears to be expressed in all neural cells.


Studies using inhibitors of catalase and acatalasemic mice revealed that catalase is responsible for approximately half of the ethanol metabolism occurring in the CNS [91].


Nonetheless, ADH4 inhibition avoids the synaptic dysfunction associated with severe alcohol intoxication in the hippocampus [89].


This enzyme is induced in response to chronic drinking and it may contribute to the increased rates of ethanol elimination in heavy drinkers. Some endogenous substrates for CYP2E1 include acetone and fatty acids, both of which are abundant in the brain [95].


Moreover, in human neurons CYP2E1 is known to generate ROS and nitric oxide through the induction of NADPH/xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase [99].


Therefore, CYP2E1 and catalase are the main pathways in the brain that metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde, while ADH appears to play a minor role.


Acetaldehyde is a biologically active compound and it has been implicated in alcohol addiction [100, 101], as well as inducing euphoria at low concentrations [102]. The effects of ethanol are modulated by acetaldehyde [100, 103], which in turn may react with endogenous substances to form other biologically active compounds.


Moreover adducts like salsolinol (formed when acetaldehyde binds to dopamine) were also seen to be involved in neurotoxicity [106] and in reinforcing addictive ethanol conduct [107].


However, the accumulation of NADH increases in association with ALDH activity [114] and if the NAD+/NADH ratio decreases, the amounts of superoxide radicals increase [115, 116].

When cells or animals receive carnitine it acts as a neuroprotective agent, preventing ethanol-induced damage [147].


Furthermore, ϖ type-3 unsaturated fatty acids and DHA provide neuroprotection in conjunction with an increase in the formation of acylethanolamine [161, 162], suggesting that the formation of the latter prevents the damage caused by the oxidative metabolism of ethanol. Finally, ethanol can also be metabolized as phosphatidylethanol, a molecule found in the brain of rats [192] that is possibly formed to avoid ethanol oxidation.


Acylethanolamines can be found in the mitochondria in vitro [191] and palmitoyl requires carnitine to enter mitochondria.

	abstract = {Background
A number of social drinkers claim that they do not experience next-day hangovers despite consuming large quantities of alcohol. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of drinkers who claim to be hangover immune and compare them with drinkers who do report having hangovers.

Methods
A total of 36 social drinkers participated in a naturalistic study consisting of a hangover day (alcohol consumed) and a control day (no alcohol consumed). Data were collected on alcohol consumption, demographics, sleep, next-day adverse effects, and mood. Data from drinkers with a hangover (N=18) were compared with data from drinkers who claim to be hangover immune (N=18).

Results
Drinkers with a hangover reported drowsiness-related symptoms, symptoms related to reduced cognitive functioning, and classic hangover symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, weakness, and stomach pain. Corresponding mood changes comprised increased feelings of depression, anger–hostility, fatigue, and reduced vigor–activity. In contrast, hangover-immune drinkers reported relatively few hangover symptoms, with only mild corresponding severity scores. The reported symptoms were limited to drowsiness-related symptoms such as sleepiness and being tired. The classic hangover symptoms were usually not reported by these drinkers.

Conclusion
In contrast to drinkers with a hangover, for those who claim to be hangover immune, next-day adverse effects of alcohol consumption are limited to a mild increase in drowsiness-related symptoms.},

The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether acute EtOH intoxication antagonizes the contraction-induced increase in protein synthesis and mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle. Fasted male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 g/kg EtOH or saline (control), and the right hindlimb was electrically stimulated (10 sets of 6 contractions). The gastrocnemius muscle complex was collected 30 min, 4 h, or 12 h after stimulation. EtOH decreased in vivo basal protein synthesis (PS) in the nonstimulated muscle compared with time-matched Controls at 30 min, 4 h, and 12 h. In Control, but not EtOH, PS was decreased 15\% after 30 min. In contrast, PS was increased in Control 4 h poststimulation but remained unchanged in EtOH. Last, stimulation increased PS 10\% in Control and EtOH at 12 h, even though the absolute rate remained reduced by EtOH. The stimulation-induced increase in the phosphorylation of S6K1 Thr421/Ser424 (20–52\%), S6K1 Thr389 (45–57\%), and its substrate rpS6 Ser240/244 (37–72\%) was blunted by EtOH at 30 min, 4 h, and 12 h. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 Ser65 was also attenuated by EtOH (61\%) at 4 h. Conversely, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase Thr202/Tyr204 was increased by stimulation in Control and EtOH mice at 30 min but only in Control at 4 h. Our data indicate that acute EtOH intoxication suppresses muscle protein synthesis for at least 12 h and greatly impairs contraction-induced changes in synthesis and mTOR signaling.},

To investigate the role of the epithelium in this Gln dependence, Caco-2 cells were raised on semipermeable membranes under conditions that model different regions of the crypt and villus. Gln availability was controlled by addition to the medium and treatment with methionine sulfoximine to inhibit Gln synthetase (GS). Barrier function was assayed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and fluxes of [14C]mannitol and fluoroscein isothiocyanate–dextran. The barrier function of these monolayers was found to require the Gln provided either in the medium at the apical or basal surface or via GS. However, the barrier was no more sensitive to Gln deprivation than it was to accumulation or maintenance of total protein. These results suggest that the in vivo dependence of the gut mucosal barrier on Gln likely involves roles separate from maintenance of the epithelial barrier per se.},

Furthermore, quercetin prophylaxis evidently ameliorated ethanol-stimulated mitochondrial dysfunction manifested by decreased membrane potential and induced permeability transition though suppressing glutathione depletion, enzymatic inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, ROS over-generation, and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria.

Because of its intoxicating and addictive properties, it is necessary to analyze its effect in the central nervous system. However, we are only now learning about the mechanisms controlling the modification of important membrane proteins such as ligand-activated ion channels by ethanol. Furthermore, only recently are these effects being correlated to behavioral changes. Current studies show that the glycine receptor (GlyR) is a susceptible target for low concentrations of ethanol (5 to 100 mM). GlyRs are relevant for the effects of ethanol because they are found in the spinal cord and brain stem where they primarily express the α1 subunit. More recently, the presence of GlyRs was described in higher regions, such as the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, with a prevalence of α2/α3 subunits. Here, we review data on the following aspects of ethanol effects on GlyRs: 1) direct interaction of ethanol with amino acids in the extracellular or transmembrane domains, and indirect mechanisms through the activation of signal transduction pathways; 2) analysis of α2 and α3 subunits having different sensitivities to ethanol which allows the identification of structural requirements for ethanol modulation present in the intracellular domain and C-terminal region; 3) Genetically modified knock-in mice for α1 GlyRs that have an impaired interaction with G protein and demonstrate reduced ethanol sensitivity without changes in glycinergic transmission; and 4) GlyRs as potential therapeutic targets.},

DESIGN--Four treatments were allocated in a randomised controlled order on four days over a period of 11 days. SETTING--Metabolic ward of research institute. SUBJECTS--Eight white healthy middle aged men. INTERVENTIONS--Subjects were provided with food for the 11 days. On the four study days mineral water or 40 g of alcohol in the form of beer, wine, or spirits was consumed at dinner early in the evening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, tissue type plasminogen activator antigen, and tissue type plasminogen activator activity one hour before and one, three, five, nine, and 13 hours after dinner with mineral water or alcoholic beverages. RESULTS--After dinner with alcohol plasminogen activator inhibitor activity rose from 53 (SD 19)\% to a maximum of 667 (283\%) five hours after dinner (P {\textless} 0.001). Tissue type plasminogen activator antigen levels rose from 5.3 (2.2) micrograms/l to a maximum of 10.8 (3.8) micrograms/l nine hours after dinner with alcohol (P {\textless} 0.001). Plasminogen activator activity was reduced in the postprandial period (from 1387 (483) IU/l to 323 (288) IU/l five hours after eating; P {\textless} 0.001) but was higher than normal early the next morning (1516 (809) IU/l after alcohol, 779 (516) IU/l after water; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION--Moderate alcohol consumption with dinner affects plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, plasminogen activator antigen level, and tissue type plasminogen activator activity temporarily. The effects observed in the early morning are consistent with a decrease in risk of coronary heart disease in moderate drinkers.},

We aimed to characterize the associations of usual alcohol consumption with a comprehensive systemic metabolite profile in young adults., Methods: Cross-sectional associations of alcohol intake with 86 metabolic measures were assessed for 9778 individuals from three population-based cohorts from Finland (age 24–45 years, 52\% women). Metabolic changes associated with change in alcohol intake during 6-year follow-up were further examined for 1466 individuals. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaires. Circulating lipids, fatty acids and metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays., Results: Increased alcohol intake was associated with cardiometabolic risk markers across multiple metabolic pathways, including higher lipid concentrations in HDL subclasses and smaller LDL particle size, increased proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, lower concentrations of glutamine and citrate (P {\textless} 0.001 for 56 metabolic measures). Many metabolic biomarkers displayed U-shaped associations with alcohol consumption. Results were coherent for men and women, consistent across the three cohorts and similar if adjusting for body mass index, smoking and physical activity. The metabolic changes accompanying change in alcohol intake during follow-up resembled the cross-sectional association pattern (R2 = 0.83, slope = 0.72 ± 0.04)., Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is associated with a complex metabolic signature, including aberrations in multiple biomarkers for elevated cardiometabolic risk. The metabolic signature tracks with long-term changes in alcohol consumption. These results elucidate the double-edged effects of alcohol on cardiovascular risk.},

Here we investigated the effects of MB (100 nM, 300 nM, and 1 μM) on key bioenergetic parameters and on H2O2 production/elimination in isolated guinea pig brain mitochondria under normal as well as respiration-impaired conditions. As measured by high-resolution Oxygraph the rate of resting oxygen consumption was increased, but the ADP-stimulated respiration was unaffected by MB with any of the substrates (glutamate malate, succinate, or α-glycerophosphate) used for supporting mitochondrial respiration. In mitochondria treated with inhibitors of complex I or complex III MB moderately but significantly increased the rate of ATP production, restored ΔΨm, and increased the rate of Ca2+ uptake. The effects of MB are consistent with transferring electrons from upstream components of the electron transport chain to cytochrome c, which is energetically favorable when the flow of electrons in the respiratory chain is compromised. On the other hand, MB significantly increased the production of H2O2 measured by Amplex UltraRed fluorimetry under all conditions, in resting, ATP-synthesizing, and respiration-impaired mitochondria, with each substrate combination supporting respiration. Furthermore, it also decreased the elimination of H2O2. Generation of H2O2 without superoxide formation, observed in the presence of MB, is interpreted as a result of reduction of molecular oxygen to H2O2 by the reduced MB. The elevated generation and impaired elimination of H2O2 should be considered for the overall oxidative state of mitochondria treated with MB.},

This case report documents the effectiveness of inositol treatment on a chronic patient with bipolar disorder I and severe psoriasis. Her lithium treatment was discontinued due to psoriasis exacerbation and inositol was administered. The remarked positive effect of inositol was noted on her stable mood during the last 4 years, the absence of psoriatic lesions, which lead to an improved quality of life of the patient.

Case presentation
A 62-year-old female Caucasian patient suffering from bipolar disorder, since the age of 32, presenting manic episodes when without lithium treatment. Lithium treatment caused severe exacerbation of psoriasis and was discontinued while anti-psoriatic treatment had no effect. The last 4 years the patient receives 3 gr per day of inositol alone and her mood has been stabilized while there is also a remarkable improvement on her psoriatic lesions.

Conclusion
Taking into consideration the course of her bipolar disorder when lithium was discontinued previously we consider that the 4 years of follow up assessments of this patient as a satisfactory time period for concluding that inositol has been a very effective treatment, replacing lithium, for mood stabilization and psoriasis.},

Markers of liver injury induced by alcohol: elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride and cholesterol, are reduced by GF-AS in both acutely and chronically treated rats. The activities of lipogenic enzymes including malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphoglucuronic acid dehydrogenase in chronic alcohol-treated rats are significantly decreased by GF-AS. Furthemore, GF-AS improves histological change in fatty liver and hepatic lesions induced by alcohol.

	abstract = {The involvement of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been elucidated by experiments with hallucinogens. Application of a hallucinogen to humans leads to changes in perception, cognition, emotions, and induction of psychotic-like symptoms that resemble symptoms of schizophrenia. In rodent studies, their acute administration affects sensorimotor gating, locomotor activity, social behavior, and cognition including working memory, the phenotypes are considered as an animal model of schizophrenia. The complexity and singularity of human cognition raises questions about the validity of animal models utilizing agonists of 5-HT2A receptors. The present study thus investigated the effect of psilocin on memory acquisition, reinforced retrieval, and memory consolidation in rats. Psilocin is a main metabolite of psilocybin acting as an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors with a contribution of 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors. First, we tested the effect of psilocin on the acquisition of a Carousel maze, a spatial task requiring navigation using distal cues, attention, and cognitive coordination. Psilocin significantly impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze at both doses (1 and 4 mg/kg). The higher dose of psilocin blocked the learning processes even in an additional session when the rats received only saline. Next, we examined the effect of psilocin on reinforced retrieval and consolidation in the Morris water maze (MWM). The dose of 4 mg/kg disrupted reinforced retrieval in the MWM. However, the application of a lower dose was without any significant effect. Finally, neither the low nor high dose of psilocin injected post-training caused a deficit in memory consolidation in the MWM. Taken together, the psilocin dose dependently impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze and reinforced retrieval in MWM; however, it had no effect on memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {The 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. GPCRs transduce extracellular signals to the interior of cells through their interaction with G-proteins. The 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors mediate effects of a large variety of compounds affecting depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, hallucinations, dysthymia, sleep patterns, feeding behaviour and neuro-endocrine functions. Binding of such compounds to either 5-HT2 receptor subtype induces processes that regulate receptor sensitivity. In contrast to most other receptors, chronic blockade of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors leads not to an up- but to a (paradoxical) down-regulation. This review deals with published data involving such non-classical regulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies. The underlying regulatory processes of the agonist-induced regulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, commonly thought to be desensitisation and resensitisation, are discussed. The atypical down-regulation of both 5-HT2 receptor subtypes by antidepressants, antipsychotics and 5-HT2 antagonists is reviewed. The possible mechanisms of this paradoxical down-regulation are discussed, and a new hypothesis on possible heterologous regulation of 5-HT2A receptors is proposed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

While this learning strategy has proved successful for both brain models and applications, computational examples show that attention to early critical features may later distort memory representations during online fast learning. For supervised learning, biased ARTMAP (bARTMAP) solves the problem of over-emphasis on early critical features by directing attention away from previously attended features after the system makes a predictive error. Small-scale, hand-computed analog and binary examples illustrate key model dynamics. Two-dimensional simulation examples demonstrate the evolution of bARTMAP memories as they are learned online. Benchmark simulations show that featural biasing also improves performance on large-scale examples. One example, which predicts movie genres and is based, in part, on the Netflix Prize database, was developed for this project. Both first principles and consistent performance improvements on all simulation studies suggest that featural biasing should be incorporated by default in all ARTMAP systems.

In this study, 20 healthy men who were all social drinkers drank alcohol (2.2 g/kg) in controlled circumstances on a Saturday evening. Ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) values were compared with ABPM values of the same subjects during the previous sober Saturday, separately throughout 6 hours of intoxication, throughout 6 hours when blood alcohol levels decreased, and throughout 6 hangover hours. During the intoxication period, both mean systolic BP and mean diastolic BP were 5 mm Hg higher (P=0.0183 and P=0.0529, respectively) and the pulse was 18 beats per minute faster (P=0.0001) compared with the corresponding sober period during the previous weekend. While blood alcohol levels decreased after drinking, mean systolic BP was 4 mm Hg lower (P=0.0331), diastolic BP was 5 mm Hg lower (P=0.0058), and pulse was 15 bpm faster (P=0.0001) than during the sober weekend. No statistically significant difference was found between the weekends in BP values during the hangover period. Drinking seems to increase both systolic and diastolic BP during intoxication but not during hangover. During the period when blood alcohol levels are decreasing, usually at night, both pressure levels fall to less than the basic level. These major and rapid changes in BP values might increase the likelihood of strokes, which are seen in increased numbers among young adults, especially during weekends and holidays.},

	issn = {0145-6008},
	abstract = {Numerous studies have indicated a correlation between ethanol intake and cigarette smoking in heavy drinkers. We have studied the underlying pharmacological basis of this relationship using cultured rat cortical neurons. These neurons express nicotinic receptors having characteristics similar to those described for the alpha4beta2 subunit combination. In the presence of alpha-bungarotoxin both acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine evoked currents with respective EC50 values of 4.3 and 3.4 microM. The maximal nicotine-activated response, however, was only 56\% that of the maximal ACh current. It was previously shown that 10 to 100 mM of ethanol potentiated ACh-mediated currents in these neurons. We demonstrate that 100 mM ethanol similarly potentiates currents evoked by 300 nM (40\%) and 1 microM nicotine 61\%). This suggests that an ethanol-induced potentiation of nicotinic currents may enhance the acute positive reinforcement associated with nicotine and could increase tobacco use during heavy ethanol intake. However, further experimentation indicated that the continuous perfusion of 30, 100, or 300 nM nicotine desensitizes ACh-evoked currents by 38, 54, and 62\%, respectively, with little direct receptor-channel activation. The residual ACh currents of nicotine-desensitized receptor channels were potentiated by 100 mM ethanol to nearly the extent as were the undesensitized control responses. We propose that the opposing effect of ethanol on nicotine-induced desensitization could also explain the increased tobacco use observed with excessive drinking. Thus, ethanol has a dual effect regarding nicotine. It enhances acute nicotine-mediated receptor activation, although opposing the net effect of nicotine-induced receptor channel desensitization.},

Some of the damage are permanent while some are appearantly reversible. It is our aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced and/or related brain damage, particularly of that observed in ‘medically uncomplicated’ (without heptatic cirrhosis or Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome [WKS]) alcoholics. Methods: A high-throughput proteomics technology has been applied to several ‘alcohol-sensitive’ brain regions from uncomplicated and hepatic cirrhosis-complicated alcoholics to understand the mechanisms of alcohol-related brain damage at the level of protein expression. Results: It was clearly demonstrated that each brain region reacts in significantly different manner to chronic alcohol ingestion. Appearant abnormalities in vitamin B1 (thiamine)-related biochemical pathways were observed in several brain regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, genu (a frontal part of the corpus callosum) and cerebellar vermis in uncomplicated alcoholics, suggesting that the reduction of this important nutritional component might be associated with brain damage even without the signs of WKS. In addition, in the two different subregions of the corpus callosum (genu and splenium [a posterior part of the corpus callosum]) and the cerebellar vermis, significant differences in protein expression profiles between uncomplicated and complicated alcoholics with hepatic cirrhosis were identified, suggesting that hepatic factors such as ammonia have significant additive influences on brain protein expression, which might lead to the structural changes and/or damage in these brain regions. Furthermore, in the hippocampus, significant change of the level of glutamine synthetase expression was observed, suggesting once again the importance of ammonia as a cause of brain damage in this region. Conclusions: Although our data did not show any evidence of “direct” alcohol effects to induce the alteration of protein expression in association with brain damage, high-throughput neuroproteomics approaches are proven to have a potential to dissect the mechanisms of complex brain disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
The Hangover Symptoms Scale (HSS) assesses the frequency of 13 symptoms experienced after drinking in the past year. Cross-sectional analyses in college drinkers showed preliminary evidence for the validity of the HSS (). The current investigation extended this work by examining the construct validity of the HSS in an ecological momentary assessment investigation.

Methods
Frequent drinkers (N = 404) carried electronic diaries to track their daily experiences over three weeks. Each morning, the diary assessed prior-night drinking behaviors, the presence of current hangover, and intensity of current headache and nausea.

Results
Adjusting for sex and body mass, the HSS significantly predicted diary endorsement of hangover (OR = 2.11, 95\% CI = 1.78–2.49, p {\textless}.001). Participants who endorsed the HSS headache and nausea items were especially likely to report elevations of corresponding symptoms in diary records made the morning after drinking. HSS scores incrementally predicted hangover when the number of drinks consumed in the episode was covaried but did not moderate the relationship between the number of drinks and diary hangover reports.

Conclusions
The HSS appears to be a valid tool for hangover research. Higher HSS scores identify individuals who complain of “real world” hangovers and who may be especially likely to display particular symptoms after a night of drinking. Past hangovers predicted future hangovers, suggesting hangovers do not necessarily discourage or inhibit future drinking, at least across the several-week time interval studied here. There is a need to develop and evaluate complementary measures that can more directly index individual differences in hangover susceptibility in survey designs.},

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0277-2116},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is absorbed in the intestinal tract coupled with sodium and is the principal metabolic substrate for the enterocyte. Therefore, an oral rehydration solution containing this substance might provide an effective oral means of restoring electrolyte losses as well as speeding repair of mucosal damage. The objective of this work was to investigate the use of an oral rehydration solution based on glutamine in vivo in the perfused rabbit ileal loop model of secretory diarrhea induced by choleratoxin.
METHODS: Phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP, 50 mg/l) was used as a nonabsorbable marker for calculations of net water and electrolyte transport. Solutions tested included: (a) a glutamine-based oral rehydration solution with 111 mmol/l glutamine, (Gln-ORS); (b) the oral rehydration solution recommended by the World Health Organization; (c) modified Ringer's solution. Choleratoxin (1 microg/ml) was injected into the lumen of the ileal rabbit segments for 30 minutes prior to the initiation of the perfusion.
RESULTS: Choleratoxin induced significant secretion of sodium in the control modified Ringer's solution (10.8 +/- 2.95 vs -14.05 +/- 5.95 microEq/g/min, n = 10; p {\textless} 0.01) and of water (0.06 +/- 0.03 vs -0.15 +/- 0.06 ml/g/min, n = 10; p {\textless} 0.01) with a maximum effect at 60 minutes after initiation of perfusion. World Health Organization oral rehydration solution was able to significantly reduce the intestinal secretion of sodium (control with cholera = -14.34 +/- 2.18 vs oral rehydration solution with cholera = -0.50 +/- 0.48 microEq/g/min, n = 10; p {\textless} 0.01) and water (-0.15 +/- 0.02 vs -0.012 +/- 0.005 ml/g/min, n = 10; p {\textless} 0.01). For comparison, glutamine-based oral rehydration solution had an even greater effect on sodium and water absorption (glutamine-based oral rehydration solution with choleratoxin = 10.31 +/- 1.21 microEq/g/min, n = 5; p {\textless} 0.01 for sodium and 0.08 +/- 0.008 ml water/g/min; n = 5; p {\textless} 0.01). Choleratoxin did not change the effect of glutamine-based oral rehydration solution on sodium and water absorption (12.90 +/- -1.09 microEq sodium/g/min, n = 5; and 0.11 +/- 0.01 ml water/g/min; n = 5). In addition glutamine-based oral rehydration solution also induced a greater absorption of potassium and chloride in the intestinal ileal segments treated with choleratoxin compared with World Health Organization glutamine-based oral rehydration solution.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the superior efficacy of glutamine-based oral rehydration solution in electrolyte and water absorption compared with modified Ringer's control solution or even with World Health Organization-recommended oral rehydration solution.},

	abstract = {Hangover may be related to propensity to develop alcohol use disorders (AUDs). However, the etiological role, if any, played by hangover in AUD is unclear. From a motivational perspective, hangover can be construed as either a deterrent to future alcohol consumption or a setting event for negative reinforcement that could promote deviant drinking practices (e.g., “hair-of-the-dog” drinking). Hangover could be related to AUD risk even if it does not play a direct role in promoting or inhibiting near-term drinking. For example, measures of hangover might serve as symptoms of AUD or as markers of individual differences that more directly account for AUD risk. Empirical evidence (though usually indirect) exists to support contentions that hangover is related to both risk for and protection from AUD. In this article, we briefly address variation in assessment strategies in existing hangover research because measures of hangover frequency and hangover susceptibility may prove to have different correlates. Next, we review the existing, limited evidence on relations between hangover and AUD risk. Finally, we sketch a variety of theoretically-informed hypotheses that might help delineate productive lines of inquiry for this emerging field.},

Alleles associated with increased acetaldehyde and flushing phenotypes are robustly associated with protection from AUD [42-44].


Thus, existing data are fairly consistent in indicating that drinkers with genotypes known to lead to acetaldehyde accumulation and confer protection from AUD are also more susceptible to hangover effects, at least as gauged by retrospective survey or self-reports of the expected aftereffects of drinking.
},
	annote = {
As we review below, population subgroups with differing risks for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) indeed appear to differ with respect to measures of hangover. Curiously, though, excess hangover has been reported in groups at both increased and decreased risk for AUD.
},

In sum, limited evidence hints that hangover may be more frequent among smokers. If so, this is likely to be explained by more frequent drinking among smokers because smoking status does not appear to be associated with differential hangover susceptibility.
},

These kinds of findings have been tentatively interpreted as evidence that women are more susceptible to hangover than are men [4, 16].


Most studies involving both men and women and explicitly testing sex differences in next-day symptoms have not found significant effects [1, 26-30].


However, no sex differences were found for objective measures of cognitive performance in this study. Slight differences in dosing protocols across studies might help to explain the discrepant effects.


Fifteen or more drinks appeared to be the optimal threshold for predicting hangover symptoms for men, whereas 10 or more drinks appeared to be a more appropriate hangover threshold for women.


the relation between number of drinks and HLE endorsement was stronger among women.


Sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol therefore appear to provide a reasonable account for the pattern of existing evidence. At the same number of drinks, women are more prone to hangover than men, but this is likely explained by the tendency for women to attain higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). At equivalent BACs, men and women appear to be indistinguishable with respect to most hangover effects.

Thus, hangover-reactive individuals may be more sensitive to both the immediate and post-intoxication effects of alcohol.

	abstract = {Background
The mechanism(s) by which alcohol causes cell injury are still not clear but a major mechanism appears to be the role of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in alcohol toxicity. CYP2E1-generated ROS contributes to the ethanol-induced oxidant stress and inhibition of CYP2E1 activity decreases ethanol-induced fatty liver. The transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the expression of many cytoprotective enzymes which results in cellular protection against a variety of toxins.

Method
The current study was designed to evaluate the ability of sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, to blunt CYP2E1-dependent, ethanol-induced steatosis in vivo and in vitro.

Results
The sulforaphane treatment activated Nrf2, increased levels of the Nrf2 target heme oxygenase -1 and subsequently lowered oxidant stress as shown by the decline in lipid peroxidation and 3-Nitrotyrosine protein adducts and an increase in GSH levels after the acute ethanol treatment. It decreased ethanol-elevated liver levels of triglycerides and cholesterol and Oil Red O staining. Similar results were found in vitro as addition of sulforaphane to HepG2 E47 cells, which express CYP2E1, elevated Nrf2 levels and decreased the accumulation of lipid in cells cultured with ethanol. Sulforaphane treatment had no effect on levels of or activity of CYP2E1.

Conclusions
Sulforaphane proved to be an effective in vivo inhibitor of acute ethanol–induced fatty liver in mice.

General significance
The possible amelioration of liver injury which occurs under these conditions by chemical activators of Nrf2 is of clinical relevance and worthy of further study.},

	abstract = {Converging evidence indicates an association of the short (s), low-expressing variant of the repeat length polymorphism, serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), in the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) with anxiety-related traits and increased risk for depression in interaction with psychosocial adversity across the life span. However, genetically driven deficient serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function would not have been maintained throughout evolution if it only exerted negative effects without conveying any gain of function. Here, we review recent findings that humans and nonhuman primates carrying the s variant of the 5-HTTLPR outperform subjects carrying the long allele in an array of cognitive tasks and show increased social conformity. In addition, studies in 5-HTT knockout rodents are included that provide complementary insights in the beneficial effects of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele. We postulate that hypervigilance, mediated by hyperactivity in corticolimbic structures, may be the common denominator in the anxiety-related traits and (social) cognitive superiority of s-allele carriers and that environmental conditions determine whether a response will turn out to be negative (emotional) or positive (cognitive, in conformity with the social group). Taken together, these findings urge for a conceptual change in the current deficit-oriented connotation of the 5-HTTLPR variants. In fact, these factors may counterbalance or completely offset the negative consequences of the anxiety-related traits. This notion may not only explain the modest effect size of the 5-HTTLPR and inconsistent reports but may also lead to a more refined appreciation of allelic variation in 5-HTT function. ?? 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

The present study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to examine the temporal relationships between drinking and hangovers and how this varied by age and sex. We hypothesized that alcohol’s dose-dependent effects on hangover severity are more pronounced among adolescents and young adults than older drinkers. We also explored whether greater hangover severity would lead to a lower likelihood and volume of alcohol use later the same day. Data were pooled from four studies of drinkers (N = 274; ages 15 to 66 years) who completed a 4- to 14-day (M = 7.46, SD = 1.13) EMA monitoring period. Each morning, participants recorded how much alcohol they consumed the day before and rated their hangover severity. Participants who consumed a greater quantity of alcohol the prior day reported more severe hangover symptoms; however, there was an interaction between drinking volume and age such that hangover was more severe among younger drinkers, especially at higher drinking levels. More severe hangover symptoms did not predict the likelihood of drinking later that day; however, on drinking days more severe hangover symptoms predicted lower quantities of alcohol use later that day. This event-level effect did not vary as a function of age. Study outcomes did not vary by sex. Our findings suggest that younger drinkers experience more severe hangovers and that greater hangover results in lighter drinking later that same day regardless of age.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackgroundAntioxidant defence has been reported to decrease, and oxidative stress to increase, after oral glucose loading in both normal and diabetic subjects. If confirmed in normal subjects, glucose–induced antioxidant depletion has important implications for health in relation to the modern, sugar–rich diet.Aim of the studyTo investigate changes in plasma biomarkers of oxidant:antioxidant balance in non–diabetic subjects following oral glucose loading. Baseline inter–relationships between biomarkers of glycaemic control, oxidant:antioxidant balance and inflammation were also explored.MethodsA singleblinded, placebo–controlled, crossover intervention trial involving 10 healthy, consenting subjects. Venous blood was collected after ingestion of 75 g glucose in 300 mL water, or of water alone. Blood was collected at 0 time (fasting) and 30, 60, 90, 120 min post–ingestion. Within 2 weeks the procedure was repeated with volunteers crossedover onto the other treatment. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (as the FRAP value), ascorbic acid, α–tocopherol, uric acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), allantoin and high sensitivity C–reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose and insulin, were measured in all samples. Paired results post–glucose and post–water at each time interval were compared using the Wilcoxon matched–pairs signed–ranks test.ResultsNormal glucose tolerance was observed in all subjects, although, as expected, plasma glucose and insulin increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05, n = 10) after glucose loading. Post–glucose responses in plasma FRAP and the individual antioxidants tested were not significantly different to the responses seen post–water, although both FRAP and α–tocopherol decreased slightly. Neither were postglucose changes in plasma MDA and allantoin, putative biomarkers of oxidative stress, significantly different to those after intake of water alone. Plasma FRAP and α-tocopherol also decreased slightly, but not significantly, after intake of water. A significant direct correlation (r = 0.867, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 10) was found between fasting allantoin and (log transformed) hsCRP concentrations.ConclusionsThese new data from a controlled intervention trial indicate that acute, transient increases in plasma glucose following oral intake of a large glucose load do not, as previously reported, cause a significant decrease in plasma antioxidants or increase oxidative stress in non–diabetic subjects. This is reassuring given the large quantities of sugar ingested by children and adolescents. However, a small decrease in plasma antioxidant capacity was seen after ingestion of water and of glucose, and it is possible that intake of glucose without concomitant intake of antioxidants in susceptible individuals may cause oxidative stress. Further work is needed in relation to diabetic subjects and a possible glucose threshold for this. The finding of a direct relationship between allantoin, a biomarker of oxidative stress, and hsCRP, a marker of inflammation and CHD predictor, in healthy subjects is interesting and indicates a link between sub–clinical inflammation and oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Herein, we have reviewed the role of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, in a number of neurochemical, -physiological, and -behavioral processes mediating the development of alcohol dependence. The findings discussed include results from both preclinical as well as neuroimaging and postmortem clinical studies. Expression levels for a number of glutamate-associated genes and/or proteins are modulated by alcohol abuse and dependence. These changes in expression include metabotropic receptors and ionotropic receptor subunits as well as different glutamate transporters. Moreover, these changes in gene expression parallel the pharmacologic manipulation of these same receptors and transporters. Some of these gene expression changes may have predated alcohol abuse and dependence because a number of glutamate-associated polymorphisms are related to a genetic predisposition to develop alcohol dependence. Other glutamate-associated polymorphisms are linked to age at the onset of alcohol-dependence and initial level of response/sensitivity to alcohol. Finally, findings of innate and/or ethanol-induced glutamate-associated gene expression differences/changes observed in a genetic animal model of alcoholism, the P rat, are summarized. Overall, the existing literature indicates that changes in glutamate receptors, transporters, enzymes, and scaffolding proteins are crucial for the development of alcohol dependence and there is a substantial genetic component to these effects. This indicates that continued research into the genetic underpinnings of these glutamate-associated effects will provide important novel molecular targets for treating alcohol abuse and dependence.},

	abstract = {The epithelial and endothelial barriers of the human body are major obstacles for drug delivery to the systemic circulation and to organs with unique environment and homeostasis, like the central nervous system. Several transport routes exist in these barriers, which potentially can be exploited for enhancing drug permeability. Beside the transcellular pathways via transporters, adsorptive and receptor-mediated transcytosis, the paracellular flux for cells and molecules is very limited. While lipophilic molecules can diffuse across the cellular plasma membranes, the junctional complexes restrict or completely block the free passage of hydrophilic molecules through the paracellular clefts. Absorption or permeability enhancers developed in the last 40 years for modifying intercellular junctions and paracellular permeability have unspecific mode of action and the effective and toxic doses are very close. Recent advances in barrier research led to the discovery of an increasing number of integral membrane, adaptor, regulator and signalling proteins in tight and adherens junctions. New tight junction modulators are under development, which can directly target tight or adherens junction proteins, the signalling pathways regulating junctional function, or tight junction associated lipid raft microdomains. Modulators acting directly on tight junctions include peptides derived from zonula occludens toxin, or Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, peptides selected by phage display that bind to integral membrane tight junction proteins, and lipid modulators. They can reversibly increase paracellular transport and drug delivery with less toxicity than previous absorption enhancers, and have a potential to be used as pharmaceutical excipients to improve drug delivery across epithelial barriers and the blood–brain barrier.},

	abstract = {Penthorum chinense Pursh (Penthoraceae) has been used as a Miao ethnomedicine for the treatment of jaundice, cholecystitis, edema, infectious hepatitis and anti-drunk hangover in China. The aim of present study is to investigate the possible protective effects of Penthorum chinense against chronic ethanol-induced liver injury. Mice were fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin as control diet with or without aqueous extract of Penthorum chinense (PCP, 5.15 and 10.30g/kg/BW) for 4 weeks. Silymarin (86mg/kg) was used as positive control to compare the efficacy of PCP against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Treatment with PCP (10.30g/kg) significantly reduced the increases in serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-6), which were induced by chronic ethanol exposure. PCP was also found to attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, restore the glutathione (GSH) depletion, and increase the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. In addition, PCP supplementation (10.30g/kg) inhibited the induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), a major contributor to ethanol-mediated oxidative stress, and up-regulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream anti-oxidant protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ethanol-treated mice. These results indicate that the co-treatment with aqueous extract of Penthorum chinense (10.30g/kg) protects against chronic ethanol-induced liver injury, possibly through suppressing CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and enhancing the oxidant defense systems via the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.},

	abstract = {Background Intestinal barrier dysfunction and translocation of endotoxins are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Exposure to ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde at relatively high concentrations have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelial tight junctions in the conventional two dimensional cell culture models. The present study investigated quantitatively and qualitatively the effects of ethanol at concentrations detected in the blood after moderate ethanol consumption, of its metabolite acetaldehyde and of the combination of both compounds on intestinal barrier function in a three-dimensional cell culture model.   Methods and Findings Caco-2 cells were grown in a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel™) to induce spheroid formation and were then exposed to the compounds at the basolateral side. Morphological differentiation of the spheroids was assessed by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. The barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-labeled dextran from the basal side into the spheroids' luminal compartment using confocal microscopy. Caco-2 cells grown on Matrigel assembled into fully differentiated and polarized spheroids with a central lumen, closely resembling enterocytes in vivo and provide an excellent model to study epithelial barrier functionality. Exposure to ethanol (10–40 mM) or acetaldehyde (25–200 µM) for 3 h, dose-dependently and additively increased the paracellular permeability and induced redistribution of ZO-1 and occludin without affecting cell viability or tight junction-encoding gene expression. Furthermore, ethanol and acetaldehyde induced lysine residue and microtubules hyperacetylation.   Conclusions These results indicate that ethanol at concentrations found in the blood after moderate drinking and acetaldehyde, alone and in combination, can increase the intestinal epithelial permeability. The data also point to the involvement of protein hyperacetylation in ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced loss of tight junctions integrity.},

To assess the effect on tHcy according to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C{\textgreater}T genotype., Design and methods: A randomized controlled crossover intervention study measuring tHcy and serum folate and vitamin B12 concentrations was conducted in 78 male subjects (21–70 years). Following a 2-week washout period during which no alcohol was consumed, all subjects consumed 24 g alcohol (either 240 ml red wine or 80 ml vodka)/day for a 2-week period. Following a further 2-week washout, participants consumed the alternate intervention for 2 weeks., Results: A significant increase in plasma tHcy was observed after the 2-week red wine intervention (5\%, P = 0.03), and a non-significant increase in tHcy with vodka intervention (3\%, P = 0.09). When the two interventions were compared, the change in tHcy did not differ between the vodka and red wine interventions (P = 0.57). There were significant decreases in serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations, and this decrease did not differ between interventions. The increase in tHcy observed in both interventions did not vary by MTHFR 677C{\textgreater}T genotype., Conclusions: A 2-week alcohol intervention resulted in a decrease in folate and vitamin B12 status and an increase in plasma tHcy. The effect of alcohol intervention on tHcy, folate and vitamin B12 concentrations did not differ between the red wine and vodka intervention groups.},

	abstract = {Many translucent industrial insulation applications require optimization of both the thermal and optical properties. Currently, the thermal performance witnessed in today's products often limits the amount of available area which can be designated for translucent panels. For example, translucent wall panels for passive lighting systems must provide both adequate light transmission as well as sufficient thermal insulation. In granular fill systems, these demands can sometimes work against each other since thermal performance will improve as the panel thickness is increased but light transmission will decrease accordingly. In contrast, the optical properties can be significantly enhanced by careful control of the particle size and size distribution. This in turn impacts the thermal resistance since spaces between the particles act as large pores that dominate the heat transfer. We have investigated aerogel materials derived from commercially viable silica sources. Results indicate that depending on the silica precursor, particle size distribution, and control over other processing conditions, the optical transparency can be varied from 25\% to 80\% in a 20 mm layer. Within these same constraints, we have found the thermal conductivity can be varied from 0.0140 to 0.0210 W/m K. This ability to tailor the optical and thermal characteristics, coupled with superior thermal properties of aerogel, may enable more widespread acceptance. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a familiar experience for the elite or novice athlete. Symptoms can range from muscle tenderness to severe debilitating pain. The mechanisms, treatment strategies, and impact on athletic performance remain uncertain, despite the high incidence of DOMS. DOMS is most prevalent at the beginning of the sporting season when athletes are returning to training following a period of reduced activity. DOMS is also common when athletes are first introduced to certain types of activities regardless of the time of year. Eccentric activities induce micro-injury at a greater frequency and severity than other types of muscle actions. The intensity and duration of exercise are also important factors in DOMS onset. Up to six hypothesised theories have been proposed for the mechanism of DOMS, namely: lactic acid, muscle spasm, connective tissue damage, muscle damage, inflammation and the enzyme efflux theories. However, an integration of two or more theories is likely to explain muscle soreness. DOMS can affect athletic performance by causing a reduction in joint range of motion, shock attenuation and peak torque. Alterations in muscle sequencing and recruitment patterns may also occur, causing unaccustomed stress to be placed on muscle ligaments and tendons. These compensatory mechanisms may increase the risk of further injury if a premature return to sport is attempted. A number of treatment strategies have been introduced to help alleviate the severity of DOMS and to restore the maximal function of the muscles as rapidly as possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated dosage-dependent effects that may also be influenced by the time of administra- tion. Similarly, massage has shown varying results that may be attributed to the time of massage application and the type of massage technique used. Cryotherapy, stretching, homeopathy, ultrasound and electrical current modalities have demon- strated no effect on the alleviation of muscle soreness or other DOMS symptoms. Exercise is the most effective means of alleviating pain during DOMS, however the analgesic effect is also temporary. Athletes who must train on a daily basis should be encouraged to reduce the intensity and duration of exercise for 1–2 days following intense DOMS-inducing exercise. Alternatively, exercises targeting less affected body parts should be encouraged in order to allow the most affected muscle groups to recover. Eccentric exercises or novel activities should be introduced progressively over a period of 1 or 2 weeks at the beginning of, or during, the sporting season in order to reduce the level of physical impairment and/or training disruption. There are still many unanswered questions relating to DOMS, and many potential areas for future research.},

	abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that glycine receptors in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) are involved in modulating both basal and ethanol-induced dopamine output in the same brain region. Ethanol is known to induce a release of both taurine and dopamine in the nAc, but the relationship between these two neuromodulators has not been investigated thoroughly. In vivo microdialysis was used to measure the effects of systemic ethanol diluted in isotonic (0.9\% NaCl) or hypertonic (3.6\% NaCl) saline on accumbal taurine and dopamine levels. We found that ethanol given in a hypertonic solution, contrary to an isotonic solution, failed to increase concentrations both of taurine and dopamine in the nAc. However, a modest, non-dopamine elevating concentration of taurine in the nAc disclosed a dopamine-elevating effect of systemic ethanol also when given in a hypertonic solution. In a second experiment, we investigated the effects of ethanol on taurine and dopamine in normal rats and rats with decreased levels of endogenous taurine. Lowering the level of taurine, approximately 40\% by adding 5\% β-alanine in the drinking water, did not influence taurine or dopamine output over time. We conclude that the elevations of taurine and dopamine in the nAc are closely related, and that in order for ethanol to induce dopamine release, a simultaneous increase of extracellular taurine levels in the nAc is required. These data also provide support for the notion that the nAc is the primary target for ethanol in its dopamine-activating effect after systemic administration.},

	abstract = {It is believed that drug-induced rewarding effects play an important role in the development of substance dependence. Recently, berberine was reported to inhibit the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine, morphine, and nicotine. Berberine is also demonstrated to modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems like, dopamine, nitric oxide, serotonin, and NMDA, which are implicated in rewarding effects of ethanol. Hence, we hypothesized that berberine may modulate the ethanol-induced rewarding effects. Therefore, we studied the effect of berberine on locomotor sensitization, conditioned place preference (CPP), and ethanol drinking preference in mice. The results revealed that acute administration of berberine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently reduced locomotor stimulant effect of acute ethanol and expression of sensitization to locomotor stimulant effect of ethanol. Further, pretreatment with berberine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to each dose of ethanol, blocked the development as well as expression of sensitization to locomotor stimulant effect of ethanol. In another set of experiment, treatment with berberine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the induction and expression of ethanol-induced CPP in mice. In addition, berberine in these doses also reduced preference to ethanol drinking over water, but did not alter the general reward. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that berberine attenuates ethanol-induced rewarding effects in mice and that could be attributed to its neuro-modulatory action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP.
AIM: We evaluated the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein, respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was performed by computerized image analysis system.
RESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 ± 10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively, with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1\%) patients in each group (P = 1.000). The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68 (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P = 0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal permeability and morphology improved significantly in both glutamine and ACG.},

In the study, the team used transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a) — an inflammatory-mediating cytokine — as the COX-2 induction stimulus, against which 14 natural-product compounds were tested (all were characterized as antioxidants and chemopreventive agents). Of these, only five produced significant, dose-dependent decreases in TGF-a-induced COX-2 reporter activity: genistein, kaempferol, quercetin, resorcinol and resveratrol, with quercetin being the most potent. Curcumin, DHA, daidzein, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, tannic acid and reduced glutathione had no effect. These data on curcumin run contrary to the Zhang study described above. This may be due to the different experimental systems used in this study (reporter gene in human colon cancer cells) contrasted to the system used by Zhang, et al. (direct measurement of COX-2 and its activity in various GI tract cells).

The addition of pure resveratrol inhibited both these effects, reversing the increases in COX-2 mRNA and protein. In addition to modifying gene expression, they also found resveratrol to directly inhibit COX-2 activity.

Together, these findings suggest the T. wilfordii extract used in this study reduced pros-taglandin production by selectively reducing the synthesis of the COX-2 enzyme itself without inhibiting the activity of COX-2. Less COX-2 enzyme means less prostaglandins and, thus, less pain.

	abstract = {Ethanol alters the function of several members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Recent studies have shown that the sensitivity of the α1 glycine receptor (GlyR) to ethanol can be affected by the state of G protein activation mediated by the interaction of Gβγ with intracellular amino acids in the GlyR. Here, we evaluated the physicochemical property of Lys385 that contributes to ethanol modulation by using mutagenesis, patch-clamp, and biochemical techniques. A conserved substitution (K385R) did not affect either the apparent glycine EC₅₀ (40 ± 1 versus 41 ± 0.5 μM) or the ethanol-induced potentiation (53 ± 5 versus 46 ± 5\%) of the human α1 GlyR. On the other hand, replacement of this residue with glutamic acid (K385E), an acidic amino acid, reduced the potentiation of the GlyR to 10 ± 1\%. Furthermore, mutations with a hydrophobic leucine (K385L), a hydrogen bond donor glutamine (K385Q), or a neutral residue (K385A) also reduced ethanol modulation. Finally, substitution by a large and hydrophobic residue (K385F) and deletion of 385 (Lys385\_) reduced ethanol modulation to 10 ± 4 and 17 ± 0.4\%, respectively. Experiments using dynamic cysteine substitution with a methanethiosulfonate reagent and homology modeling indicate that the basic property and the position of Lys385, probably because of its interaction with Gβγ, is critical for ethanol potentiation of the receptor.},

Agmatine inhibited the acquisition but not the expression of ethanol CPP. Furthermore, both the I₁ receptor antagonist, efaroxan (9 mg/kg) and the I₂ receptor antagonist, BU224 (5 mg/kg) attenuated the agmatine-induced inhibition of the ethanol CPP acquisition. In contrast, the I₂ receptor agonist, 2-BFI (5 mg/kg) and I₁ receptor agonist, moxonidine (0.4 mg/kg) alone, or a combination of their subeffective doses, significantly attenuated the effect of agmatine (20 mg/kg) on acquisition of ethanol CPP. Agmatine or imidazoline agents alone produced neither place preference nor aversion, and at the doses used in the present study did not affect locomotor activity. Thus, agmatine attenuates the acquisition of ethanol CPP at least in part by imidazoline (I₁ or I₂) receptors.

After the end of drinking, at bedtime, in the following morning after waking-up, and on two further occasions during the morning and early afternoon, breath-alcohol tests were performed and samples of urine were collected for analysis of ethanol and methanol and the 5-hydroxytryptophol (5-HTOL) to 5-hydroxyindol-3-ylacetic acid (5-HIAA) ratio The participants were also asked to quantify the intensity of hangover symptoms (headache, nausea, anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue, muscle aches, vertigo) on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe symptoms). The first morning urine void collected 6-11 h after bedtime as a rule contained measurable amounts of ethanol, being 0.09 ± 0.03 g/l (mean ± SD) after 50 g and 0.38 ± 0.1 g/l after 80 g ethanol. The corresponding breath-alcohol concentrations were zero, except for three individuals who registered 0.01–0.09 g/l. Ethanol was not measurable in urine samples collected later in the morning and early afternoon. The peak urinary methanol occurred in the first morning void, when the mean concentration after 80 g ethanol was ˜ 6-fold higher than pre-drinking values. This compares with a ˜ 50-fold increase for the 5-HTOL/5-HIAA ratio in the first morning void. Both methanol and the 5-HTOL/5-HIAA ratio remained elevated above pre-drinking baseline values in the second and sometimes even the third morning voids. Most subjects experienced only mild hangover symptoms after drinking 50 g ethanol (mean score 2.4 ± 2.6), but the scores were significantly higher after drinking 80g (78 ± 7.1). The most common symptoms were headache, drowsiness, and fatigue A highly significant correlation (r = 0.62–0.75, P {\textless}0.01) was found between the presence of headache, nausea, and vertigo and the urinary methanol concentration in the first and second morning voids, whereas 5-HTOL/5-HIAA correlated with headache and nausea. These results show that analysing urinary methanol and 5-HTOL furnishes a way to disclose recent drinking after alcohol has no longer been measurable by conventional breath-alcohol tests for at least 5–10 h. The results also support the notion that methanol may be an important factor in the aetiology of hangover.},

This hypothesis was tested by measuring dopamine (DA) release by intracranial microdialysis during voluntary oral ethanol self-administration in alcohol-preferring (P) and genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. The animals were trained to respond for ethanol (10\% w/v) or water in a free-choice operant task. Extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens were subsequently monitored during 30-min self-administration sessions and a 15-min "waiting period" before session onset. Ethanol self-administration in all animals was followed by a significant, dose-dependent rise in DA release with maximal effects at approximately 15 min after peak intake. Dose-effect functions revealed significantly steeper slopes for the DA-releasing effects of ethanol in P than in genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. Over an identical range of ethanol doses and blood alcohol levels, increases in DA efflux ranged from 143\% to 459\% of basal levels in P rats but only from 142\% to 212\% in Wistar rats. To differentiate the pharmacological effects of ethanol from the effects of operant responding, additional groups of P and Wistar rats were tested during self-administration of saccharin (0.05\% w/v). By contrast with ethanol, saccharin did not substantially elevate extracellular DA levels. A significant, transient increase in DA efflux was, however, observed in both strains of rats during the presession waiting period in the absence of ethanol or saccharin availability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Event-related potential (ERP) is a reliable neuroelectric measure of brain activity that helps to confirm the assessment of mental status and cognitive impairment. Many studies have reported that alcoholics show a significantly lower ERP P300 amplitude than the norm. In the present study, ERP P300 waves were measured to evaluate the effect of citric acid on cognitive function during excessive alcohol consumption in healthy adults. Five volunteers were selected through clinical interview, physical examination, and psychiatric assessment for participation in this study. In a double-blind placebo-controlled before-after design, each subject was treated with 5 ml/kg body weight alcohol, 5 ml/kg body weight alcohol and 1 mg citric acid, or a placebo on three separate occasions, one week apart. ERP P300, blood biochemical indicators, blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and acetaldehyde concentrations were assessed. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a within-subjects factor was used to evaluate differences in blood biochemical indicators, BACs, blood acetaldehyde concentrations, and ERP P300 in the three sessions of assessments. Several blood biochemical indicators showed significant differences between treatments, including the levels of cholinesterase (CHE), total bile acid (TBA), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and glycylproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (GPDA). BACs after consumption of alcohol alone or citric acid with alcohol were significantly higher compared to those after placebo treatment (P{\textless}0.05). There were no significant differences in blood acetaldehyde concentrations between the treatments. The P300 amplitudes on the frontal (Fz), central (Cz), and parietal (Pz) regions of the scalp after consumption of alcohol were significantly lower than those after consumption of the placebo or citric acid with alcohol (P{\textless}0.05), while there were no significant differences between the latter two treatments. The results of this study suggest that citric acid could reduce the decline in ERP P300 amplitude and cognitive ability induced by acute alcohol consumption. It may also affect some blood biochemical indicators, but the specific mechanisms need further research.},

Malnutrition and immune dysfunction are common features in hospitalized patients. Specific nutrients with immunological and pharmacological effects, when consumed in amounts above the daily requirement, are referred to as immune-enhancing nutrients or immunonutrients. Supplementation of immunonutrients is important especially for patients with immunodeficiency, virus or overwhelming infections accompanied by a state of malnutrition. Representative immunonutrients are arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, nucleotides, beta-carotene, and/or branched-chain amino acids. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid and performs multiple roles in human body. However, glutamine is depleted from muscle stores during severe metabolic stress including sepsis and major surgery. Therefore it is considered conditionally essential under these conditions. This review discusses the physiological role of glutamine, mode and dose for glutamine administration, as well as improvement of certain disease state after glutamine supplementation. Even though immunonutrition has not been widely assimilated by clinicians other than nutritionists, immunonutrients including glutamine may exert beneficial influence on diverse patient populations.},

One example is the Paris shoot-ings on January 7, 2015. By monitoring potential terrorists, security agencies are able to detect and stop terrorist plots at their planning stage. Although security agencies may have knowledge about potential terrorists (e.g., who they are, how they interact), they usually have limited resources and can-not monitor all terrorists. Moreover, a terrorist planner may strategically choose to arouse terrorists considering the se-curity agency's monitoring strategy. This paper makes five key contributions toward the challenging problem of com-puting optimal monitoring strategies: 1) A new Stackelberg game model for terrorist plot detection; 2) A modified double oracle framework for computing the optimal strategy effec-tively; 3) Complexity results for both defender and attacker oracle problems; 4) Novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for best response problems of both play-ers; and 5) Effective approximation algorithms for generating suboptimal responses for both players.

In this paper, a naturalistic conceptual framework is proposed for addressing these issues. This framework begins by contrasting classical and critical concepts of categories, and then puts forward an integrative position that is based on cognitive-affective research. This position can in turn be used to consider the debate between pharmacological Calvinism (which may adopt a moral metaphor of disorder) and psychotropic utopianism (which may emphasize a medical metaphor of disorder). I argue that psychiatric treatment of serious psychiatric disorders is justified, and that psychotropics are an acceptable kind of intervention. The use of psychotropics for sub-threshold phenomena requires a judicious weighing of the relevant facts (which are often sparse) and values.},

	abstract = {Background
Extract of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus) is promoted as a possible preventive or cure for alcohol-induced hangover symptoms. However, few rigorous clinical trials have assessed the effects of artichoke extract, and none has examined the effects in relation to hangovers. We undertook this study to test whether artichoke extract is effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover.

Methods
We recruited healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial. Participants received either 3 capsules of commercially available standardized artichoke extract or indistinguishable, inert placebo capsules immediately before and after alcohol exposure. After a 1-week washout period the volunteers received the opposite treatment. Participants predefined the type and amount of alcoholic beverage that would give them a hangover and ate the same meal before commencing alcohol consumption on the 2 study days. The primary outcome measure was the difference in hangover severity scores between the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. Secondary outcome measures were differences between the interventions in scores using a mood profile questionnaire and cognitive performance tests administered 1 hour before and 10 hours after alcohol exposure. 

Results
Fifteen volunteers participated in the study. The mean number (and standard deviation) of alcohol units (each unit being 7.9 g, or 10 mL, of ethanol) consumed during treatment with artichoke extract and placebo was 10.7 (3.1) and 10.5 (2.4) respectively, equivalent to 1.2 (0.3) and 1.2 (0.2) g of alcohol per kilogram body weight. The volume of nonalcoholic drink consumed and the duration of sleep were similar during the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. None of the outcome measures differed significantly between interventions. Adverse events were rare and were mild and transient.

Interpretation
Our results suggest that artichoke extract is not effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system seems to be centrally involved in regulating reward-related behavior and consequently has been implicated in addictive processes, such as alcoholism and drug addiction. This DA system has also been implicated in psychosis and in regulating hedonia/anhedonia, important components of mania and depression. Given the potentially great importance of the mesolimbic DA system for several psychiatric disorders, it is of major interest to delineate the mechanisms and dynamics underlying DA regulation and release. Recently strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyR) have attracted some interest in this matter.
METHODS: Western blot and in vivo microdialysis (couplied to high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), as well as reversed microdialysis, in awake, freely moving, adult male Wistar rats.
RESULTS: Here we demonstrate by means of Western blot that alpha GlyR subunit proteins are expressed in the rat nucleus accumbens (nAc), a major target of the mesolimbic DA system. We further show that reversed microdialysis of the competitive GlyR antagonist strychnine into the nAc concentration-dependently (2-200 microM) and in a reversible manner decreases accumbal extracellular DA levels. Conversely, reversed microdialysis of the agonist glycine increases accumbal DA levels in some rats but not others. The strychnine-induced depression of the accumbal DA levels is antagonized by simultaneous local perfusion of glycine.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that GlyRs in the nAc are tonically activated and of importance for regulating extracellular DA levels. The possibility of pharmacologically interfering with GlyRs to combat psychiatric disorders, in which the mesolimbic DA system is implicated, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and psychosis, should be explored.},

Absorption from the gut and accumulation in the tissues and cells must occur via a specific carrier mechanism because the compound is charged at physiologic pH and, hence, biological membranes are almost completely impermeable to the organic cation in the absence of an uptake system. Agmatine initially attracted attention as an endogenous ligand at imidazoline receptors and α(2)-adrenoceptors. However, independent of binding to those receptors, agmatine induces a variety of physiological and pharmacological effects exhibiting a great therapeutic potential of the compound. Although the precise function of endogenous agmatine is presently still unclear, this review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the physiological and pathophysiological function of agmatine.},

Agmatine, which is a metabolite of l-arginine, is known to participate in many biophysical reactions, including those in the cardiovascular system. We sought to investigate plasma agmatine levels in human subjects as a potential biomarker for the metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: Agmatine concentration was measured in plasma from 322 elderly participants in the Ansan Geriatric study. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to an Asian modified version of criteria established in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. We observed that the metabolic syndrome was associated with low levels of plasma agmatine concentration.
RESULTS: The mean plasma agmatine level in the metabolic syndrome group was lower than that in the non-metabolic syndrome group (79.42 ng/mL vs. 82.44 ng/mL, P = 0.024). Agmatine remained significant within the regression model after adjustment for different covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 0.962; 95\% confidence interval, 0.933-0.993).

	abstract = {Chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk for cancer of the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract and the upper digestive tract (i.e., upper aerodigestive tract), liver, colon, rectum, and breast. Various factors may contribute to the development (i.e., pathogenesis) of alcohol-associated cancer, including the actions of acetaldehyde, the first and most toxic metabolite of alcohol metabolism. The main enzymes involved in alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are encoded by multiple genes. Because some of these genes exist in several variants (i.e., are polymorphic), and the enzymes encoded by certain variants may result in elevated acetaldehyde levels, the presence of these variants may predispose to certain cancers. Several mechanisms may contribute to alcohol-related cancer development. Acetaldehyde itself is a cancer-causing substance in experimental animals and reacts with DNA to form cancer-promoting compounds. In addition, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that are generated during certain pathways of alcohol metabolism can damage the DNA, thus also inducing tumor development. Together with other factors related to chronic alcohol consumption, these metabolism-related factors may increase tumor risk in chronic heavy drinkers.},

	abstract = {Background
Alcohol is a significant component of the diet with dose-dependent risks and benefits. High doses of alcohol damage the liver and early symptoms of liver disease include changes in routinely assessed liver enzymes. Less is known regarding the mechanisms responsible for the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, including their effects on the liver. The objectives of this study were to examine alcohol’s dose-dependent effects on markers of liver function (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin), as well as to compare the different methods of assessing alcohol intake using NHANES 2001–2010 adult data (N = 24,807).

Methods
Three methods were used to estimate alcohol intake from all volunteers: 24-h recall; the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method of usual intake; and a specific alcohol intake questionnaire.

Results
Mean alcohol intake by 24-h recall, NCI method and questionnaire was 41.0 ± 0.8 g/d, 10.9 ± 0.2 g/d and 11.0 ± 0.2 g/d, respectively. Alcohol consumers had significantly lower levels of ALP and higher levels of AST, GGT and bilirubin compared to non-consumers (P {\textless} 0.01) and activities of ALT, AST, and GGT increased and of ALP decreased as alcohol intake increased, regardless of intake assessment method used. The most sensitive measure of alcohol consumption was GGT.

Conclusions
Since alcohol had a graded linear effect on several liver enzymes, including at low and moderate doses, benefits as well as risks of alcohol intake may be related to liver function. Since the NCI method and alcohol questionnaire yielded very similar alcohol intake estimates, this study cross-validated these methods and demonstrated the robustness of the NCI method for estimating intake of irregularly consumed foods.},

	abstract = {Background
Little is known about the effects of dietary components on the regulation of the gastric emptying rate of alcohol and its impact on alcohol metabolism. We recently found that the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers from several types of botanical foods maintained aqueous ethanol solutions. Additionally, the ethanol-absorbing ability of the dietary fibers correlated with the inhibition of the blood ethanol elevation by delaying gastric emptying. Moreover, we found that the synergism between tomatoes and alanine to reduce the absorption of alcohol in rats was attributable to the effect of alanine on precipitates, such as the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers of tomatoes. In the present study, we assess whether an alanine-fortified tomato (AFT) is effective in relieving acute alcohol-induced adverse effects by lowering the alcohol action in healthy human volunteers following the ingestion of alcohol with a meal.

Methods
Twenty healthy males ingested the AFT or sugar as the control, with 1.2 g/kg of alcohol and a micronutrient-fortified meal in a randomized cross-over study. Breath alcohol concentrations were temporally measured, and blood and urine samples were obtained during the trial. The study protocol was repeated with the AFT and sugar groups reversed 4 weeks later.

Results
Various analyses were performed using the data from the 15 subjects. The breath alcohol concentrations significantly decreased when AFT was ingested. A decrease in the urinary pH was also noted following the ingestion of AFT. Moreover, the sum of seven sedative scores as subjective sensation after alcohol ingestion was significantly reduced by AFT the next morning.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that the simultaneous ingestion of AFT under the consumption of excess alcohol and a micronutrient-fortified meal relieved the acute alcohol-induced adverse effects in male volunteers. These results are consistent with the effectiveness observed in rats as previously reported.},

On the first day, the 15 athletes ran without the use of supplements and blood samples were taken every 30 min.

Blood ammonia level was determined before the run and every 30 min during the run. During the control trial ammonia increased progressively to approximately 70\% above rest concentration. Following supplementation, independent of treatment, ammonia was not different (p{\textgreater}0.05) for the first 60 min, but for the second hour it was lower than in the control (p{\textless}0.05).

Methods : Water-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 12 healthy subjects during fasting and 1 h after a meal. Specifiable non-disintegrating capsules were administered at 7, 4 and 1 h prior to imaging. Results : While food intake reduced the mean fluid volumes in the small intestine (105 ± 72 mL vs. 54 ± 41 mL, P {\textless} 0.01) it had no significant effect on the mean fluid volumes in the colon (13 ± 12 mL vs. 18 ± 26 mL). The mean number of separated fluid pockets increased in both organs after meal (small intestine: 4 vs. 6, P {\textless} 0.05; large intestine: 4 vs. 6, P {\textless} 0.05). The distribution of capsules between the small and large intestine was strongly influenced by food (colon: 3 vs. 17 capsules, P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions : The results show that fluid is not homogeneously distributed along the gut, which likely contributes to the individual variability of drug absorption.

Exposure to ethanol abuse and severe oxidative stress are risk factors for hepatocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and its combinations with taurine and/or betaine on the level of glutathione (GSH), a powerful antioxidant in the liver, in acute hepatotoxicity induced by ethanol.

Methods
To examine the effects of SAMe and its combinations with taurine and/or betaine on ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, AML12 cells and C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with SAMe, taurine, and/or betaine, followed by ethanol challenge. Cell viability was detected with an MTT assay. GSH concentration and mRNA levels of GSH synthetic enzymes were measured using GSH reductase and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured with commercially available kits.

Results
Pretreatment of SAMe, with or without taurine and/or betaine, attenuated decreases in GSH levels and mRNA expression of the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis, in ethanol-treated cells and mice. mRNA levels of the modifier subunit of GCL and glutathione synthetase were increased in mice treated with SAMe combinations. SAMe, taurine, and/or betaine pretreatment restored serum ALT and AST levels to control levels in the ethanol-treated group.

Conclusions
Combinations of SAMe with taurine and/or betaine have a hepatoprotective effect against ethanol-induced liver injury by maintaining GSH homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Pre-cooling is used by many athletes for the purpose of reducing body temperature prior to exercise and, consequently, decreasing heat stress and improving performance. Although there are a considerable number of studies showing beneficial effects of pre-cooling, definite conclusions on the effectiveness of pre-cooling on performance cannot yet be drawn. Moreover, detailed analyses of the specific conditions under which pre-cooling may be most promising are, so far, missing. Therefore, we conducted a literature search and located 27 peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, which addressed the effects of pre-cooling on performance. These studies were analysed with regard to performance effects and several test circumstances (environmental temperature, test protocol, cooling method, aerobic capacity of the subjects).Eighteen studies were performed in a hot ({\textbackslash}textgreater26°C) environment and eight in a moderate. The cooling protocols were water application (n=12), cooling packs (n=3), cold drinks (n=2), cooling vest (n=6) and a cooled room (n=4). The following different performance tests were used: short-term, high-intensity sprints (n=2), intermittent sprints (n=6), time trials (n= 10), open-end tests (n=7) and graded exercise tests (n=2). If possible, subjects were grouped into different aerobic capacity levels according to their maximal oxygen consumption ( V? O2max): medium 55-65mL/kg/min (n= 11) and high {\textbackslash}textgreater65 mL/kg/min (n=6). For all studies the relative changes of performance due to pre-cooling compared with a control condition, as well as effect sizes (Hedges'g) were calculated. Mean values were weighted according to the number of subjects in each study.Pre-cooling had a larger effect on performance in hot (+6.6\%, g=0.62) than in moderate temperatures (+1.4\%, g = 0.004). The largest performance enhancements were found for endurance tests like open-end tests (+8.6\%, g=0.52), graded exercise tests (+6.0\%, g=0.44) and time trials (+4.2\%, g=0.44). A similar effect was observed for intermittent sprints (+3.3\%, g = 0.43), whereas performance changes were smaller during short-term, high-intensity sprints (-0.5\%, g = 0.03). The most promising cooling methods were cold drinks (+15.0\%, g= 1.68), cooling packs (+5.6\%, g = 0.70) and a cooled room (+10.7\%, g = 0.49), whereas a cooling vest (+4.8\%, g = 0.31) and water application (+1.2\%, g = 0.21) showed only small effects. With respect to aerobic capacity, the best results were found in the subjects with the highest V? O2max (high +7.7\%, g = 0.65; medium +3.8\%, g = 0.27). There were four studies analysing endurance-trained athletes under time-trial conditions, which, in a practical sense, seem to be most relevant. Those studies found an average effect on performance of 3.7\% (g = 0.48).In summary, pre-cooling can effectively enhance endurance performance, particularly in hot environments, whereas sprint exercise is barely affected. In particular, well trained athletes may benefit in a typical competition setting with practical and relevant effects.

	abstract = {Background
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) requires endotoxemia and is commonly associated with intestinal barrier leakiness. Using monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells as an in vitro barrier model, we showed that ethanol-induced intestinal barrier disruption is mediated by iNOS (inducible nitric-oxide synthase) upregulation, NO (nitric oxide) overproduction, and oxidation/nitration of cytoskeletal proteins. We hypothesized that iNOS inhibitors (L-NAME, L-NIL) in vivo will inhibit the above cascade and liver injury in an animal model of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH).

Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged daily with alcohol (6 g/kg/day) or dextrose for 10 weeks ± L-NAME, L-NIL or vehicle. Systemic and intestinal NO levels were measured by nitrites and nitrates in urine and tissue samples, oxidative damage to the intestinal mucosa by protein carbonyl and nitrotyrosine, intestinal permeability by urinary sugar tests, and liver injury by histological inflammation scores, liver fat, and myeloperoxidase activity.

Results
Alcohol caused tissue oxidation, gut leakiness, endotoxemia and ASH. L-NIL and L-NAME, but not the D-enantiomers, attenuated all steps in the alcohol-induced cascade including NO overproduction, oxidative tissue damage, gut leakiness, endotoxemia, hepatic inflammation and liver injury.

Conclusions
The mechanism we reported for alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption in vitro – NO overproduction, oxidative tissue damage, leaky gut, endotoxemia and liver injury – appears to be relevant in vivo in an animal model of alcohol-induced liver injury. That iNOS inhibitors attenuated all steps of this cascade suggests that prevention of this cascade in alcoholics will protect the liver against the injurious effects of chronic alcohol and that iNOS may be a useful target for prevention of ALD.},

Feeding of alcohol to rats for 10 weeks significantly increased serum endotoxin levels 7 fold, from 0.08 ± 0.02 to 0.58 ± 0.11 EU/ml (Fig. 5, p{\textless}0.05). L-NAME reduced this increase by 46\%) to 0.35 ± 0.02 EU/ml in alcohol fed rats (Fig. 5, p{\textless}0.05); L-NIL reduced the increase by 84\% to 0.16 ± 0.02 EU/ml.

In contrast, iNOS appears to be the key source of the EtOH-induced increase in NO levels because, in alcohol fed rats, iNOS inhibition by L-NIL significantly decreased NO levels in both urinary and colonic mucosa.

However, the inhibitory effect of L-NIL was significantly greater than L-NAME (98\% vs 46\% for urine NO; 97\% vs 64\% for colonic mucosa NO; p{\textless}0.05, Fig. 1).

The EtOH-induced increase in NO was inhibited in rats that were fed, in addition to EtOH, a nonselective iNOS inhibitor, L-NAME (46\% decrease to 410 ± 35, p{\textless}0.05, Fig. 1a) or a selective iNOS inhibitor, L-NIL (98\% decrease to 90 ± 8, p{\textless}0.05, Fig. 1a).

The storage unit is a component of ten pieced solar air collectors heating system being developed for space heating of a greenhouse and charging of PCM. CaCl26H2O was used as PCM in thermal energy storage with a melting temperature of 29 ??C. Hot air delivered by ten pieced solar air collector is passed through the PCM to charge the storage unit. The stored heat is utilized to heat ambient air before being admitted to a greenhouse. This study is based on experimental results of the PCM employed to analyze the transient thermal behavior of the storage unit during the charge and discharge periods. The proposed size of collectors integrated PCM provided about 18-23\% of total daily thermal energy requirements of the greenhouse for 3-4 h, in comparison with the conventional heating device. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed avid incorporation of agmatine into several mammalian cell lines and herein characterize agmatine transport in mammalian cells. In transformed NIH/3T3 cells, agmatine uptake is energy dependent with a saturable component indicative of carrier-mediated transport. Transport displays an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.5 μM and a maximal velocity of 280 pmol · min−1 · mg−1 protein and requires a membrane potential across the plasma membrane for uptake. Competition with polyamines, but not cationic molecules that utilize the y+ system transporter, suppresses agmatine uptake. Altering polyamine transporter activity results in parallel changes in polyamine and agmatine uptake. Furthermore, agmatine uptake is abrogated in a polyamine transport-deficient human carcinoma cell line. These lines of evidence demonstrate that agmatine utilizes, and is dependent on, the polyamine transporter for cellular uptake. The fact that this transport system is associated with proliferation could be of consequence to the antiproliferative effects of agmatine.},

The pair-fed control rats received an isocaloric diet containing dextrin-maltose instead of ethanol for 5 wks. Among the ethanol treated groups, the naringin supplements significantly lowered the plasma ethanol concentration with a simultaneous increase in the ADH and/or ALDH activities. However, among the ethanol-treated groups, naringin supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in the hepatic triglycerides and plasma and hepatic total cholesterol compared to that in the naringin-free group. Naringin supplementation significantly increased the HDL-cholesterol and HDL-C/total-C ratio, while lowering the AI value among the ethanol-treated groups. Hepatic lipid accumulation was also significantly reduced in the naringin-supplemented groups compared to the naringin-free group among the ethanol-treated groups, while no differences were found among the pair-fed groups. Among the ethanol-treated groups, the low-naringin supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of plasma and hepatic TBARS, whereas it resulted in higher SOD and GSH-Px activities and gluthathion levels in the liver. Accordingly, naringin would appear to contribute to alleviating the adverse effect of ethanol ingestion by enhancing the ethanol and lipid metabolism as well as the hepatic antioxidant defense system.},

	abstract = {Aim
To assess the effects of binge drinking on students’ next-day academic test-taking performance.

Design
A placebo-controlled cross-over design with randomly assigned order of conditions. Participants were randomized to either alcoholic beverage (mean =.12 g\% breath alcohol concentration [BrAC]) or placebo on the first night and then received the other beverage a week later. The next day, participants were assessed on test-taking, neurocognitive performance and mood state.

Participants
193 college students (≥ 21 years) recruited from greater Boston.

Setting
The trial was conducted at the General Clinical Research Center at the Boston Medical Center.

Measurements
The Graduate Record Exams © (GREs) and a quiz on a lecture presented the previous day measured test-taking performance; the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES3) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measured neurocognitive performance; and, the Profile of Mood States (POMS) measured mood.

Findings
Test-taking performance was not affected the morning after alcohol administration, but mood state and attention/reaction time were.

Conclusion
Drinking to a level of .12 g\% BrAC does not affect next-day test-taking performance, but does affect some neurocognitive measures and mood state.},

It is based on the adsorption of dilute extracts of hesperidin on a styrene-divinylbenzene (SDVB) resin and the desorption in much more reduced volumes by means of alkaline eluents. Hesperidin immediately precipitates with good yield and high purity after acidification of the concentrated solutions, thus overcoming disadvantages due to the high dilution. Different experiments were carried out to examine operating conditions in each phase of the process. Hesperidin was extracted from peel with an aqueous saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution, allowing precipitation of calcium pectates from colloidal pectins that can interfere in the subsequent phases of adsorption and separation of hesperidin. The clear extracts were neutralized to optimize adsorption on resin. The most effective eluent was 0.5 N NaOH solution containing 10\% ethanol. Recycling of the crystallization liquor improved the yield and purity of the product and reduced the acid amount required for neutralizing fresh alkaline extracts. Resin must be washed after each adsorption-desorption cycle and regenerated after five cycles. Results can constitute a useful starting point for an industrial application. A flow scheme of the process is also reported.},

The key inducer of such inflammation, and also the best understood, is gut microflora-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Alcohol can significantly increase the translocation of LPS from the gut. In healthy individuals, the adverse effects of LPS are kept in check by the actions and interactions of multiple organs. The liver plays a central role in detoxifying LPS and producing a balanced cytokine milieu. The central nervous system contributes to anti-inflammatory regulation through neuroimmunoendocrine actions. Chronic alcohol use impairs not only gut and liver functions, but also multi-organ interactions, leading to persistent systemic inflammation and ultimately, to organ damage.

	abstract = {Background
Alcohol abuse is associated with impaired circadian rhythms and sleep. Ethanol administration disrupts circadian clock phase-resetting, suggesting a mode for the disruptive effect of alcohol abuse on the circadian timing system. In this study, we extend previous work in C57BL/6J mice to: 1) characterize the SCN pharmacokinetics of acute systemic ethanol administration; 2) explore the effects of acute ethanol on photic and non-photic phase-resetting; and 2) determine if the SCN is a direct target for photic effects.

Methods
First, microdialysis was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of acute i.p. injections of 3 doses of ethanol (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg) in the mouse suprachiasmatic (SCN) circadian clock. Second, the effects of acute i.p. ethanol administration on photic phase-delays and serotonergic ([+]8-OH-DPAT-induced) phase-advances of the circadian activity rhythm were assessed. Third, the effects of reverse-microdialysis ethanol perfusion of the SCN on photic phase-resetting were characterized.

Results
Peak ethanol levels from the 3 doses of ethanol in the SCN occurred within 20–40 min post-injection with half-lives for clearance ranging from 0.6–1.8 hr. Systemic ethanol treatment dose-dependently attenuated photic and serotonergic phase-resetting. This treatment also did not affect basal SCN neuronal activity as assessed by Fos expression. Intra-SCN perfusion with ethanol markedly reduced photic phase-delays.

Conclusions
These results confirm that acute ethanol attenuates photic phase-delay shifts and serotonergic phase-advance shifts in the mouse. This dual effect could disrupt photic and non-photic entrainment mechanisms governing circadian clock timing. It is also significant that the SCN clock is a direct target for disruptive effects of ethanol on photic shifting. Such actions by ethanol could underlie the disruptive effects of alcohol abuse on behavioral, physiological, and endocrine rhythms associated with alcoholism.},

At the cellular level, alcohol abuse causes oxidative damage to mitochondria and cellular proteins and interlink with the progression of neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. We previously reported that alcohol inhibits glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to BBB dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that ethanol (EtOH)-mediated disruption in glucose uptake would deprive energy for human astrocytes and neurons inducing neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. EtOH may also have a direct effect on glucose uptake in neurons and astrocytes, which has not been previously described. Our results indicate that ethanol exposure decreases the uptake of D-(2-3H)-glucose by human astrocytes and neurons. Inhibition of glucose uptake correlates with a reduction in glucose transporter protein expression (GLUT1 in astrocytes and GLUT3 in neurons). Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a neuroprotective agent, suppresses the effects of alcohol on glucose uptake and GLUT levels, thus reducing neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. These findings suggest that deprivation of glucose in brain cells contributes to neurotoxicity in alcohol abusers, and highlights ALC as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent the deleterious health conditions caused by alcohol abuse.},

"In 1994, William-Hemby and Porrino reported that acute administration of low doses of ethanol increased glucose utilization in specific brain regions, while high doses of ethanol decreases [17]." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:49)
"In this study, we also found that acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) exerted neuroprotective effects by preventing glucose uptake dysfunction at the level of the BBB." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:49)
"Comparisons between samples were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc test. Differences were considered significant at P values ≤ 0.05." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:50)
"Human astrocytes were cultured with 5-500 mM EtOH for 24 hr, and were assessed for changes in glucose uptake." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:50)
"However, the significant decrease in glucose uptake was noted from 50 mM to 500 mM EtOH" (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:50)
"Next, we evaluated the effect of ALC (100 μM) on glucose uptake in astrocytes." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:51)
"ALC stabilized the rate of glucose uptake in astrocytes after EtOH application, indicating a protective effect of ALC (Figure 1B)." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:51)
"ALC alone did not change the GLUT1 expression versus control." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:51)
"In a similar fashion, ALC attenuated the reduction of GLUT1 protein exerted by 50 mM EtOH (Figure 3A-B)." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:51)
"To evaluate whether EtOH disrupts the glucose uptake process in neuronal cells, we treated primary human neuronal cultures with 50 mM EtOH for 24 hr." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:52)
"Concentrations up to 100 mM did not cause neuronal toxicity at 24 hr exposure (data not shown), however glucose uptake was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, starting at a concentration of 5 mM EtOH (Figure 4A)." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:52)
"Similar to the findings in astrocytes, the protective effect of ALC on GLUT3 protein levels was also observed." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:53)
"ALC alone did not affect GLUT3 protein levels, but rather it attenuated EtOH-dependent decreases in GLUT3 expression in neuronal cultures (Figure 5E-F, 6A-B)." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:53)
"Taken together, our results suggest that EtOH impairs the glucose uptake by inhibiting the expression of GLUT in human astrocytes and neurons." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:53)
"ALC acts as a neuroprotective agent to prevent the effects of alcohol on glucose uptake." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:53)

"In our experiments, we found that neuronal cells were more sensitive to EtOH exposure than astrocytes." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)
"Fetal neurons are very sensitive to exogenous stress agents, whereas glial cells like astrocytes are better adaptive to environmental stress. It remains open for further investigation whether neurons and astrocytes derived from adult brain tissues are less sensitive to EtOH insults." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)
"Another possible explanation may be that astrocytes are also better adapted to utilize non-carbohydrate substrates such as fatty acids as an alternative source of bio-energy under high-stress conditions." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)
"Another interesting observation was that ALC prevented the decrease in glucose uptake by stabilizing GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein levels after EtOH treatment." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)
"We hypothesize that ALC may stabilize the glycosylation state of astrocytic GLUT1 and neuronal GLUT3 by donating acetyl groups to glucosamine, as to enhance the activity of acetylglucosamine." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)
"Therefore, it is critical that GLUT1 and GLUT3 are functioning correctly in the plasma membrane to meet the high metabolic demands of astrocytes and neurons [28, 31]." (Muneer, Alikunju, Szlachetka, Mercer and Haorah 2011:54)

	abstract = {Objective
Metabolomics is a promising approach to the identification of biomarkers in plasma. Here, we performed a population-based, cross-sectional study to identify potential biomarkers of alcohol intake and alcohol-induced liver injury by metabolomic profiling using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS).

Methods
Fasting plasma samples were collected from 896 Japanese men who participated in the baseline survey of the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study, and 115 polar metabolites were identified and absolutely quantified by CE-MS. Information on daily ethanol intake was collected through a standardized, self-administered questionnaire. The associations between ethanol intake and plasma concentration of metabolites were examined. Relationships between metabolite concentrations or their ratios and serum liver enzyme levels in the highest ethanol intake group ({\textgreater}46.0 g/day) were then examined by linear regression analysis. Replication analysis was conducted in 193 samples collected from independent population of this cohort.

Results
Nineteen metabolites were identified to have an association with daily alcohol consumption both in the original and replication population. Three of these metabolites (threonine, glutamine, and guanidinosuccinate) were found to associate well with elevated levels of serum liver enzymes in the highest ethanol intake group, but not in the non-drinker group. We also found that the glutamate/glutamine ratio had a much stronger relation to serum γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase than glutamate or glutamine alone (standardized beta = 0.678, 0.558, 0.498, respectively).

Conclusions
We found 19 metabolites associated with alcohol intake, and three biomarker candidates (threonine, guanidinosuccinate and glutamine) of alcohol-induced liver injury. Glutamate/glutamine ratio might also be good biomarker.

	abstract = {Cluster headache (CH) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches on one side of the head, typically around the eye. There are often accompanying autonomic symptoms during the headache such as eye watering, nasal congestion and swelling around the eye, typically confined to the side of the head with the pain.
Cluster headache belongs to a group of primary headache disorders, classified as the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias or (TACs). Cluster headache is named after the demonstrated grouping of headache attacks occurring together (cluster). Individuals typically experience repeated attacks of excruciatingly severe unilateral headache pain. Cluster headache attacks often occur periodically; spontaneous remissions may interrupt active periods of pain, though about 10–15\% of chronic CH never remit. The cause of cluster headache has not been identified.
While there is no known cure, cluster headaches can sometimes be prevented and acute attacks treated. Recommended treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a fast acting triptan. Primary recommended prevention is verapamil. Steroids may be used as a transitional treatment and may prevent attack recurrence until preventative treatments take effect. The condition affects approximately 0.2\% of the general population, and men are more commonly affected than women, by a ratio of about 2.5:1 to 3.5:1.},

There is, however, no correlation between the alcohol dehydrogenase activity measured in vitro and the rate of ethanol oxidation in vivo or in liver slices [2,3,4]. As the activity of the enzyme does not appear to be the rate-limiting factor, it is assumed that the oxidation of NADH is rate- limiting for the ethanol oxidation in vivo.The oxidation rate of ethanol in human liver slices was increased 76\%, by fructose (11 mM) and 56\%, by D-glyceraldehyde (2 mM) (Table 3). Higher concentrations of D-glyceraldehyde (11 mM) had no effect; at 20 mM the oxidation rate was inhibited.Fed rats were used in these experiments and the ethanol oxidation rate was about 40\%, higher than in experiments with fasted rats; It was observed that both pyruvate and CO2, increased the oxidation rate about 80\%, and also that pyruvate increased ethanol oxidation rate even when CO2, was present (Table 3).A mere reduction of pyruvate to lactate cannot be the cause of the fructose effect, as no net formation of NAD+ occurs during the metabolism of fructose to lactate. The reaction responsible for the increase in the rate of ethanol metabolism by oxidation of the cytoplasmic NADH is reduction of oxaloacetate to malate catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase. The activity of this enzyme is very high and sufficient to account for the increase in ethanol oxidation during fructose metabolism [66], provided the production of oxaloacetate is increased in this condition.

	abstract = {The effects of a preparation of combined glutathione-enriched yeast (GEY) and rice embryo/soybean (RES) extracts (20:1), GEY/RES, on experimentally induced ethanol hangover were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. To evaluate the preventive effects on hangover, rats were orally administered GEY/RES (50/2.5, 100/5, or 200/10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At 30 minutes after the final treatment, they were challenged with 3 mL/kg ethanol (15 mL of 20\% in water/kg). The blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde were analyzed up to 7 hours postchallenge. Hepatic mRNA expression levels of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 type 2E1 (CYP2E1), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additional rats were challenged with ethanol and, 60 minutes later, administered GEY/RES to evaluate alcohol clearance. Pretreatment with GEY/RES for 2 weeks reduced the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde in a dose-dependent manner, lowering by 29.5\% and 54.6\% at the highest dose (200/10 mg/kg), respectively. The expressions of mRNAs for ADH and ALDH, the major alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, were markedly increased in the livers of rats administered GEY/RES for 2 weeks, whereas CYP2E1 mRNA was suppressed. Postchallenge treatment with GEY/RES enhanced the alcohol clearance rate by lowering blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde by 24\% and 26.6\%, respectively, for the highest dose group. GEY/RES remarkably eliminated 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate radical and FeCl(3)-mediated lipid peroxidation in vitro and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation following ethanol administration in vivo. Therefore, it is suggested that GEY/RES reduces the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde not only by modulating alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, but also by exerting its antioxidant activity, and that GEY/RES could be a promising candidate for improvements of alcoholic hangover.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether moderate alcohol consumption increases plasma high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and/or muscle oxidative capacity.

Materials and methods
Eleven lean (BMI 18–25 kg/m2) and eight overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) men consumed 100 ml whisky (∼32 g alcohol) or water daily for 4 weeks in a randomised, controlled, crossover trial. After each treatment period, muscle biopsies and fasting blood samples were collected.

Results
Adiponectin concentrations increased (p {\textless} 0.001) by 12.5\% after 4 weeks of moderate alcohol consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption tended to increase HMW adiponectin by 57\% (p = 0.07) and medium molecular weight adiponectin by 12.5\% (p = 0.07), but not low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin. Skeletal muscle citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase and β-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (β-HAD) activity were not changed after moderate alcohol consumption, but an interaction between alcohol consumption and BMI was observed for cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.072) and citrate synthase (p = 0.102) activity. Among lean men, moderate alcohol consumption tended to increase cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.08) and citrate synthase activity (p = 0.12) by 23 and 26\%, respectively, but not among overweight men. In particular, plasma HMW adiponectin correlated positively with activities of skeletal muscle citrate synthase (r = 0.64, p = 0.009), cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.59, p = 0.009) and β-HAD (r = 0.46, p = 0.056), while such correlation was not present for LMW adiponectin. Whole-body insulin sensitivity and intramyocellular triacylglycerol content were not affected by moderate alcohol consumption.

Conclusions/interpretation
Moderate alcohol consumption increases adiponectin concentrations, and in particular HMW adiponectin. Concentrations of HMW adiponectin in particular were positively associated with skeletal muscle oxidative capacity.},

After [1-13C]ethanol was systemically administrated to the rats, 13C labels were detected in glutamate, glutamine and aspartate in the carboxylic and amide carbon spectral region. 13C-labeled bicarbonate HCO3− (161.0 ppm) was also detected. Saturating acetaldehyde C1 at 207.0 ppm was found to have no effect on the ethanol C1 (57.7 ppm) signal intensity after extensive signal averaging, providing direct in vivo evidence that direct metabolism of alcohol by brain tissue is minimal. To compare the labeling of brain metabolites by ethanol with labeling by glucose, in vivo time course data were acquired during intravenous co-infusion of [1-13C]ethanol and [13C6]-D-glucose. In contrast to labeling by [13C6]-D-glucose which produced doublets of carboxylic/amide carbons with a J coupling constant of 51 Hz, the simultaneously detected glutamate and glutamine singlets are labeled by [1-13C]ethanol. Since 13C labels originated from ethanol enter brain after being converted into [1-13C]acetate in liver and the direct metabolism of ethanol by brain tissue is negligible, it is suggested that orally or intragastrically administered 13C-labeled ethanol may be used to study brain metabolism and glutamatergic neurotransmission in studies involving alcohol administration. In vivo 13C MRS of rat brain following intragastric administration of 13C-labeled ethanol is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Agmatine is an amine formed by the decarboxylation of l-arginine by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase. The fact that exogenous agmatine modulates morphine analgesia and dependence raises the question of whether the biosynthesis of endogenous agmatine is regulated during chronic pain. As a first step to understand the biological role of agmatine in human neurological and psychiatric conditions, this study was aimed to determine the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) agmatine in normal individuals. The levels of agmatine in the CSF and blood were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Samples of CSF and blood were collected from a total of 10 participants for this study. The CSF agmatine levels ranged from 24.3 to 54.0 ng/mL, whereas the plasma agmatine levels were from 8.4 to 65.1 ng/mL. The mean values with standard error for blood and CSF agmatine were 33.8 +/- 16.6 and 40.4 +/- 9.1, respectively. The statistical analysis of these 10 samples indicated no correlation between blood and CSF samples (r = .29); however, removing one outlier improved the correlation (r = .6). From this study, the authors conclude that human CSF agmatine levels can be measured by HPLC with precision and that a possible correlation exists between plasma and CSF agmatine levels. This study provides basis for future studies in human chronic pain conditions.},

	doi = {10.1177/014860719902300107},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a major fuel and an important nitrogen source for the small intestinal cell. It plays a key role in maintaining mucosal cell integrity and gut barrier function. Increased permeability may be a factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may be an interesting parameter in the follow-up of the disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether oral glutamine supplements are able to restore an increased intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.
METHODS: The inclusion criteria for the study were Crohn's disease and a disturbed small intestinal permeability for 51Cr-EDTA. Of 38 patients screened, 18 had an increased permeability (6 hours urinary excretion {\textgreater}1.1\% of label recovered in urine). Fourteen patients were included in the study and were randomized to receive either oral glutamine (7 g three times per day; n = 7) or placebo (7 g glycine three times per day; n = 7) in addition to their normal treatment during a 4-week period. The study was performed in a double-blind manner.
RESULTS: Baseline permeability (mean +/- SD) was 2.32\%+/-0.77\% dose in the glutamine group and 2.29\%+/-0.67\% dose in the placebo group. Permeability did not change significantly after glutamine (3.26\%+/-2.15\% dose) or after placebo (2.27\%+/-1.32\% dose). There was no significant effect on plasma glutamine, plasma glutamate, plasma ammonium, Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, or nutritional status.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral glutamine supplements, in the dose administered, do not seem to restore impaired permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.},

	abstract = {Vascular calcification is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (HSMCs) undergo mineralization in response to elevated levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in an active and well-regulated process. This process involves increased activity of alkaline phosphatase and increased expression of core binding factor α-1 (CBF-α1), a bone-specific transcription factor, with the subsequent induction of osteocalcin. It has been shown that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with greater calcification in coronary arteries. The goal of our study was to examine whether ethanol alters mineralization of HSMCs provoked by high Pi. Exposure of HSMCs to ethanol increased extracellular matrix calcification in a dose responsive manner, providing a significant additional calcium deposition at concentrations of ≥60 mmol/l. HSMC calcification was accompanied by further enhancement in alkaline phosphatase activity. Ethanol also provoked a significant increase in the synthesis of osteocalcin. Moreover, in cells challenged with ethanol the expression of CBF-α1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of osteoblastic transformation of HSMCs, was elevated. The observed effects of ethanol were not due to alterations of phosphate uptake by HSMCs. We conclude that ethanol enhances Pi-mediated human vascular smooth muscle calcification and transition of these cells into osteoblast-like cells.},

	abstract = {Presence of taste receptor families in the gastrointestinal mucosa suggests a physiological basis for local and early detection of a meal. We hypothesized that luminal l-glutamate, which is the primary nutrient conferring fundamental umami or proteinaceous taste, influences mucosal defense mechanisms in rat duodenum. We perfused the duodenal mucosa of anesthetized rats with l-glutamate (0.1–10 mM). Intracellular pH (pHi) of the epithelial cells, blood flow, and mucus gel thickness (MGT) were simultaneously and continuously measured in vivo. Some rats were pretreated with indomethacin or capsaicin. Duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) was measured with flow-through pH and CO2 electrodes. We tested the effects of agonists or antagonists for metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 1 or 4 or calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on defense factors. Luminal l-glutamate dose dependently increased pHi and MGT but had no effect on blood flow in the duodenum. l-glutamate (10 mM)-induced cellular alkalinization and mucus secretion were inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin or capsaicin. l-glutamate effects on pHi and MGT were mimicked by mGluR4 agonists and inhibited by an mGluR4 antagonist. CaSR agonists acidified cells with increased MGT and DBS, unlike l-glutamate. Perfusion of l-glutamate with inosinate (inosine 5′-monophosphate, 0.1 mM) enhanced DBS only in combination, suggesting synergistic activation of the l-glutamate receptor, typical of taste receptor type 1. l-leucine or l-aspartate had similar effects on DBS without any effect on pHi and MGT. Preperfusion of l-glutamate prevented acid-induced cellular injury, suggesting that l-glutamate protects the mucosa by enhancing mucosal defenses. Luminal l-glutamate may activate multiple receptors and afferent nerves and locally enhance mucosal defenses to prevent subsequent injury attributable to acid exposure in the duodenum.},

For this study, 25 healthy young men were recruited. All participants consumed 100 mL of water (placebo), commercial hangover beverage A or B, fermented A. quinata leaf (AQL) or fruit (AQF) extract before alcohol consumption. After 1 h, all participants consumed a bottle of Soju, Korean distilled liquor (360 mL), containing 20\% alcohol. Blood was collected at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h after alcohol consumption. The plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was highest in the placebo group. Compared with the control group, the AQL and AQF groups showed decreased ALT activity at 5 h after alcohol consumption. Plasma ethanol concentration was increased after alcohol intake and peaked at 3 h after alcohol consumption. Compared with the control group, the A group showed a higher plasma ethanol concentration at 1 h (P{\textless}0.05). At 3 h after alcohol consumption, the AQF group showed the lowest mean plasma ethanol concentration compared to the other groups; however, there were no statistical differences. After 5 h of alcohol consumption, the AQL and AQF groups showed lower plasma ethanol concentrations compared with the B group. The sensory evaluation score for the fermented A. quinata fruit extract was lower than for the commercial hangover beverages. In conclusion, the present intervention study results suggest that fermented A. quinata extracts alleviate alcoholic hangover and reduce plasma ethanol concentrations.},

Recently, sialic acid (SA) has been suggested as a new potential marker of excessive alcohol consumption. In this paper, the general characteristic of SA has been given including the usefulness in the identifying of alcohol abuse. The clinical studies showed that serum and saliva sialic acid concentration was significantly higher in female and male alcoholics compared to social drinkers. It has been established also, that the serum SA level in male alcoholics was significantly increased after a short period of relapse to heavy alcohol drinking. In addition, the serum SA level was significantly decreased during an alcoholism treatment and abstinence. Sialic acid seems to be interesting biochemical marker of alcohol abuse (detecting, monitoring) with the diagnostic efficiency as good as, or even better, than the traditional markers used today.},

	abstract = {Background
Overconsumption of alcohol has significant negative effects on an individual's health and contributes to an enormous economic impact on society as a whole. Pharmacotherapies to curb excessive drinking are important for treating alcohol use disorders.

Methods
Twenty (20) men participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between subjects design experiment (n=10/group) that tested the effects of kudzu extract (Alkontrol-Herbal™) for its ability to alter alcohol consumption in a natural settings laboratory. A single dose of kudzu extract (2 grams total with an active isoflavone content of 520 mg) or placebo was administered 2.5 hours before the onset of a 90 minute afternoon drinking session during which participants had the opportunity to drink up to 6 beers ad libitum; water and juice were always available as alternative beverages.

Results
During the baseline session, the placebo-randomized group consumed 2.7 ± 0.78 beers before treatment and increased consumption to 3.4 ± 1.1 beers after treatment. The kudzu group significantly reduced consumption from 3.0 ± 1.7 at baseline to 1.9 ± 1.3 beers after treatment. The placebo-treated group opened 33 beers during baseline conditions and 38 following treatment whereas the kudzu-treated group opened 32 beers during baseline conditions and only 21 following treatment. Additionally, kudzu-treated participants drank slower.

Conclusion
This is the first demonstration that a single dose of kudzu extract quickly reduces alcohol consumption in a binge drinking paradigm. These data add to the mounting clinical evidence that kudzu extract may be a safe and effective adjunctive pharmacotherapy for alcohol abuse and dependence.},

Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken from the second part of the duodenum before starting parenteral nutrition, and after two weeks. The ratio between the urine concentrations of lactulose and mannitol after enteral administration was used to measure intestinal permeability. After two weeks of parenteral nutrition in the GlnTPN group, intestinal permeability was unchanged, whereas permeability in the STPN group increased. Villus height was unaltered in the GlnTPN group but in the STPN group it decreased. The addition of glutamine to parenteral nutrition prevents deterioration of gut permeability and preserves mucosal structure.},

	abstract = {White-rot fungus Inonotus obliquus grown in submerged culture produces antioxidative phenolic compounds. In this study, addition of lignocellulosic materials into the liquid culture increased the production and antioxidant activity of extra- and intra-cellular phenolic compounds (EPC and IPC, respectively). The production of EPC and IPC was significantly enhanced by wheat straw (by 151.2 and 45.3 \%), sugarcane bagasse (by 106.9 and 26.1 \%), and rice straw (by 67.6 and 38.9 \%). Both of the EPC and IPC extracts from the three substrates showed a higher hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity than those from the control medium. The highly active polyphenols such as tea catechins of epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and phelligridin G in the EPC extracts increased by 113.1, 75.0, and 86.3 \% in the sugarcane bagasse medium. Davallialactone and inoscavin B in the EPC extracts were generated in large amounts in the lignocellulose media but not found in the control medium. The IPC extract from the wheat straw medium had the highest production of EGCG and ECG (17.6 and 18.1 mg/l). The different enhancement among the materials was attributed to the content and degradation rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The different antioxidant activity of the EPC and IPC extracts was related to their phenolic compositions.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to confirm the protective effect of berberine (BBR) on gastrointestinal injury caused by acute heavy alcohol exposure, an effect that has not been reported previously. Our research details how BBR protects against gastrointestinal injuries from acute alcohol exposure using both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Acute high alcohol concentrations lead to obvious damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa, resulting in necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. Oral administration of BBR was able to significantly reduce this alcohol-induced damage, inhibit increases of alcohol-induced TNFα and IL-1β expression in gastrointestinal mucosa as well as their upstream signals TLR2 and TLR4, and regulate cytokines that modulate tight junctions. Alcohol consumption is a popular human social behavior worldwide, and the present study reports a comprehensive mechanism by which BBR protects against gastrointestinal injuries from alcohol stress, providing people with a novel application of BBR.},

After alcohol drinking, especially acute and extensive consumption, alcohol stimulates the gastro-intestinal tract and causes stress to the gastrointestinal mucosa, inducing gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory damage, and ulcers due to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL6 and TNFα [21–23].

Approximately 7.103 g/kg alcohol was administered in the present study, which is equivalent to a human dosage of 0.7805 g/kg [15]. Based on the average body weight of 70 kg, the total amount of alcohol scales to 54.638 g in the present study, which is close to the amount of alcohol reported earlier. BBR is able to prevent the damage inflicted at high doses, demonstrating that it could be used potentially as an effective therapy in clinical practice.

Berberine (BBR) was administered at three different doses of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg. A 60\% alcohol was employed. The alcohol was administered at dose of 0.15 ml/10g body weight.

High-dose BBR (300mg/kg) effectively inhibited the alcohol-induced morphological changes of the duodenum (Fig 1A).


the necrosis in the stomach was less severe than in the small intestine[27], suggesting that the small intestines were more sensitive to alcohol damage.


Pretreatment with BBR before alcohol administration significantly reduced the BAC in mice even at the lower doses (Fig 2A).


Furthermore, the plasma ADH activity was remarkably increased in the group treated with high-dose BBR, suggesting that in addition to the protective duodenum effect, BBR could protect mice from alcohol injury through decreased blood alcohol concentration and enhanced metabolism of alcohol by increased ADH activity (Fig 2B).
},

In the present study, acute heavy alcohol consumption resulted in an abnormal expression profile of occludin and claudin4 in the gastrointestinal mucosa, and BBR antagonizes these profile changes.


Interestingly, we observed that alcohol could stimulate occludin downregulation and claudin4 upregulation in the small intestines, which has been previously reported [49].


BBR was able to down-regulate claudin4 and up-regulate occludin, returning levels to homeostasis, suggesting that BBR’s potential effect on intestinal permeability altered alcohol-induced damage.
},
	annote = {
The results revealed that acute alcohol exposure could significantly up-regulate the transcription and protein level of TNFα, IL1-β, TLR2, and TLR4, and these alcohol-dependent enhancements were antagonized by BBR administration (Fig 3).


Only one BBR dose group exhibited decreased expression of NOD2 protein as well as consistent q-PCR results, suggesting that BBR exhibits a greater effect on TLR2 and TLR4 compared with NOD2 in the stomach mucosa. O


Acute high alcohol exposure can up-regulate occludin and claudin4 expression. However, alcohol-induced expression profile changes could be antagonized by BBR, which attenuated occludin and claudin4 expression (Fig 3F and 3G \& 3M and 3N).


In the small intestine, alcohol administration suppressed the expression of occludin but increased the expression of claudin4. BBR enhanced occludin expression and attenuated claudin4 expression (Fig 4F and 4G \& 4M and 4N).

	abstract = {Stressful experiences during early-life can modulate the genetic programming of specific brain circuits underlying emotional and cognitive aspects of behavioral adaptation to stressful experiences later in life. Although this programming effect exerted by experience-related factors is an important determinant of mental health, its outcome depends on cognitive inputs and hence the valence an individual assigns to a given environmental context. From this perspective we will highlight, with studies in rodents, non-human primates and humans, the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience to stress-related mental disorders, which is based on gene-environment interactions during critical phases of perinatal and juvenile brain development. The three-hit (i.e., hit-1: genetic predisposition, hit-2: early-life environment, and hit-3: later-life environment) concept accommodates the cumulative stress hypothesis stating that in a given context vulnerability is enhanced when failure to cope with adversity accumulates. Alternatively, the concept also points to the individual's predictive adaptive capacity, which underlies the stress inoculation and match/mismatch hypotheses. The latter hypotheses propose that the experience of relatively mild early-life adversity prepares for the future and promotes resilience to similar challenges in later-life; when a mismatch occurs between early and later-life experience, coping is compromised and vulnerability is enhanced. The three-hit concept is fundamental for understanding how individuals can either be prepared for coping with life to come and remain resilient or are unable to do so and succumb to a stress-related mental disorder, under seemingly identical circumstances. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Zinc deficiency has been well documented in alcoholic liver disease.
Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether dietary zinc supplementation provides beneficial effects in treating alcohol-induced gut leakiness and endotoxemia.
Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups and pair-fed (PF) Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 8 wk: 1) control (PF); 2) alcohol-fed (AF; 5.00–5.42\% wt:vol ethanol); and 3) AF with zinc supplementation (AF/Zn) at 220 ppm zinc sulfate heptahydrate. The PF and AF/Zn groups were pair-fed with the AF group. Hepatic inflammation and endotoxin signaling were determined by immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Alterations in intestinal tight junctions and aldehyde dehydrogenases were assessed by qPCR and Western blot analysis.
Results: The AF rats had greater macrophage activation and cytokine production (P {\textless} 0.05) in the liver compared with the PF rats, whereas the AF/Zn rats showed no significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Plasma endotoxin concentrations of the AF rats were 136\% greater than those of the PF rats, whereas the AF/Zn rats did not differ from the PF rats. Ileal permeability was 255\% greater in the AF rats and 19\% greater in the AF/Zn rats than in the PF rats. The AF group had reduced intestinal claudin-1, occludin, and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression, and the AF/Zn group had upregulated claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with the PF group. The intestinal epithelial expression and activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases were elevated (P {\textless} 0.05) in the AF/Zn rats compared with those of the AF rats. Furthermore, the ileal expression and function of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, which was impaired in the AF group, was significantly elevated in the AF/Zn group compared with the PF group.
Conclusions: The results demonstrate that attenuating hepatic endotoxin signaling by preserving the intestinal barrier contributes to the protective effect of zinc on alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats.},

	abstract = {Ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) contributes to increased oxidative stress and steatosis in chronic alcohol-exposure models. However, its role in binge ethanol-induced gut leakiness and hepatic injury is unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the role of CYP2E1 in binge alcohol-induced gut leakiness and the mechanisms of steatohepatitis. Female wild-type (WT) and Cyp2e1-null mice were treated with three doses of binge ethanol (WT-EtOH or Cyp2e1-null-EtOH) (6 g/kg oral gavage at 12-h intervals) or dextrose (negative control). Intestinal histology of only WT-EtOH exhibited epithelial alteration and blebbing of lamina propria while liver histology obtained at 6 h after the last ethanol dose showed elevated steatosis with scattered inflammatory foci. These were accompanied by increased levels of serum endotoxin, hepatic enterobacteria and triglycerides. All these changes including the intestinal histology and hepatic apoptosis, determined by TUNEL assay, were significantly reversed when WT-EtOH mice were treated with the specific inhibitor of CYP2E1 chlormethiazole and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, both of which suppressed the oxidative markers including intestinal CYP2E1. WT-EtOH also exhibited elevated amounts of serum TNF-α, hepatic cytokines, CYP2E1 and lipid peroxidation with decreased levels of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and suppressed aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity. Increased hepatocyte apoptosis with elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and decreased levels of active (phosphorylated) p-AKT, p-AMPK and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), all of which are involved in fat metabolism and inflammation, were observed in WT-EtOH. These changes were significantly attenuated in the corresponding Cyp2e1-null-EtOH mice. These data indicate that both intestinal and hepatic CYP2E1 induced by binge alcohol seem critical in the binge alcohol-mediated increased nitroxidative stress, gut leakage, endotoxemia, and altered fat metabolism, and inflammation, contributing to hepatic apoptosis and steatohepatitis.},

	abstract = {Condensation reactions between some SH-amino acids (L-and D-cysteine 1\%) and acetaldehyde (50 microM) were studied in vitro experiment. In the aqueous solution, free acetaldehyde was reduced to 41.3\% by L-cysteine and to 36.4\% by D-cysteine. In the reaction with human blood medium, after the medium was deproteinized with perchloric acid reagent, acetaldehyde was reduced to 47.0\% by L-cysteine and to 43.8\% by D-cysteine. D-Cysteine appears to have great stability of reacting acetaldehyde. In vitro experiment reactability for D-cysteine exhibited 3-8\% higher than that for L-cysteine. Next, effects of some amino acids on alcohol metabolism were studied in male ICR mice. The animals were given ethanol through a gastric catheter at a dose of 2 g/kg and they were intraperitoneally injected L-cysteine (300 mg/kg), D-cysteine (300 mg/kg), L-alanine (300 mg/kg) and control (saline), respectively in the period of one hour before the injection of ethanol. Blood and tissues samples were analyzed for ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetate and acetone during alcohol intoxication in mice by head space gas chromatography. In the groups administered D-cysteine and L-cysteine, the mice showed a definitely faster oxidation and disappearance of ethanol. Especially in the D-cysteine group, ethanol levels in blood, liver and brain remained lower than that in the other groups (p less than 0.01). Acetaldehyde levels in blood, liver and brain remained low by L-cysteine. Ethanol metabolites during alcohol oxidation by chemical reactabilities of L- and D-cysteine showed different distribution in the mice, respectively. In the mice received L-alanine, acetate and acetone levels in blood, liver and brain were distinctly reduced (p less than 0.01). L-Alanine is reported to supply an abundance of pyruvic acid that performs the NAD-generating system. NAD produced is introduced to alcohol metabolism and the TCA cycle.

	abstract = {Modafinil, in its two clinical formulations (Provigil® and Nuvigil®), is a widely prescribed wake-promoting therapeutic agent. It binds competitively to the cell-membrane dopamine (DA) transporter and is dependent on catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and adrenergic) signaling for its wake-promoting effects. The clinical spectrum of effects for modafinil is distinct from the effects seen with other catecholaminergic agents. Relative to other commonly used agents that act through catecholaminergic mechanisms, modafinil has a relatively low abuse potential, produces wakefulness with an attenuated compensatory sleep recovery thereafter, and does not ameliorate cataplexy in narcolepsy. These clinically relevant phenomenological differences between modafinil and agents such as amphetamines and cocaine do not eliminate catecholaminergic effects as a possible mediator of its wake-promoting action; they merely reflect its unique pharmacological profile. Modafinil is an exceptionally weak, but apparently very selective, DA transporter inhibitor. The pharmacodynamic response to modafinil, as measured by DA levels in brain microdialyzate, is protracted relative to other agents that act via catecholaminergic mechanisms. The conformational constraints on the interaction of modafinil with the DA transporter – and probably, as a consequence, its effects on trace amine receptor signaling in the catecholaminergic cell – are unique among catecholaminergic agents. These unique pharmacological properties of modafinil should be considered both in seeking to thoroughly understand its putatively elusive mechanism of action and in the design of novel therapeutic agents.},

Although alcohol can alter the actions of all cell populations involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, the effect in many cases is a subclinical immunosuppression that becomes clinically relevant only after a secondary insult (e.g., bacterial or viral infection or other tissue damage). Alcohol’s specific effects on the innate immune system depend on the pattern of alcohol exposure, with acute alcohol inhibiting and chronic alcohol accelerating inflammatory responses. The proinflammatory effects of chronic alcohol play a major role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and pancreatitis, but also affect numerous other organs and tissues. In addition to promoting proinflammatory immune responses, alcohol also impairs anti-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic alcohol exposure also interferes with the normal functioning of all aspects of the adaptive immune response, including both cell-mediated and humoral responses. All of these effects enhance the susceptibility of chronic alcoholics to viral and bacterial infections and to sterile inflammation.},

In the current study we measured FAEE formation in rats after short-term oral administration of ethanol, in the presence and absence of pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine. Ethanol treatment caused a significant increase in the levels of FAEE, particularly in the brain and heart, but also in the kidney and liver. Increases in FAEE were associated with a significant increase in FAEE synthase activity, GSH transferase activity, and lipid hydroperoxide levels. Pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine resulted in a significant reduction of FAEE accumulation, decrease in FAEE synthase and GSH transferase activities, and lipid hydroperoxide levels. Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine greatly reduced the metabolic abnormalities due to non-oxidative ethanol metabolism, through an increment in lipid metabolism/turnover and by the modulation of the activities of enzymes associated with FAEE synthesis. These results suggest a potentially important pharmacological role for acetyl-L-carnitine in the prevention of alcohol-induced cellular damage.},

"In the current study we measured FAEE formation in rats after short-term oral administration of ethanol, in the presence and absence of pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:167)
"Pretreatment with acetyl-L-carnitine resulted in a significant reduction of FAEE accumulation, decrease in FAEE synthase and GSH transferase activities, and lipid hydroperoxide levels." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:167)
"These results suggest a potentially important pharmacological role for acetyl-L-carnitine in the prevention of alcohol-induced cellular damage." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:167)

The molecular pathology of ethanol is almost certainly multi-factorial, but one of its major effects is to alter the composition of lipids in various cells throughout the body. (note on p.167)
 
"However, it is not clear whether these alterations are related to any pharmacological effects of ethanol, per se, or to its oxidative metabolism, which produces oxidants and free radical-mediated reactions." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:167)
"However, this oxidative metabolism of ethanol cannot account for cellular damage in organs such as brain, heart or pancreas, as this metabolic pathway is minimal or absent (1) and these tissues are free of substantial acetaldehyde production (2)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:167)
"Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase (FAEES) activity has been recognized in different organs, such as human heart, brain, pancreas, and liver and has been demonstrated to be a glutathione (GSH) transferase (5)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"One of the most prominent feature of FAEE formation is that these compounds may accumulate in concentrations as high as 100 μM in the myocardium, and that their half-life is approximately 16 hours; thus, they may persist at potentially toxic levels, long after ethanol has been fully cleared from the blood (7)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"FAEE are largely associated with mitochondrial membranes, where a lipase exists that cleaves FAEE to free fatty acids, which are also known uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation;" (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"FAEE have disordering effects on membranes, exceeding that of ethanol by approximately an order of magnitude;" (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"even low concentrations of FAEE have been demonstrated to inhibit the hepatic enzyme triacylglycerole lipase as well as protein synthesis," (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"Thus, the esterification of free fatty acids in response to an ethanol load may represent part of a toxic cycle (9)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"the carnitine system has also been shown to be involved in a) membrane stabilization and repair, b) the intracellular communication of acyl groups, upon which peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation depends, c) the metabolism of branched chain amino acids or the removal of disruptive acyl CoAs, such as acylcarnitines (10-11)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"In particular, acetyl-L-carnitine is capable of inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase activity and hence ethanol oxidation (12)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"human volunteers receiving alcohol after treatment with L-carnitine exhibited significantly reduced levels of ethanol in blood associated with increased excretion of acyl-carnitine derivatives (13)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to evaluate the possible interaction between acetyl-L-carnitine and ethanol metabolism in various organs in the rat, and to elucidate the role of enzymes of non-oxidative ethanol metabolism in FAEE formation and their relationship to lipid hydroperoxide production during short-term ethanol intake." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:168)
"Short-term administration of alcohol at a dose of 2g/kg body weight to rats fasted overnight, resulted in a blood ethanol concentration of 56.8 ± 8.3 mmol/l approximately 1 h after ethanol ingestion." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"In the group of rats pretreated with acetyl-L-carnitine, the maximal ethanol concentration in blood was slightly higher than that of animals administered ethanol alone. When the same dose of alcohol was given to L-carnitine pretreated rats, the maximal ethanol concentration in blood was significantly lower (30\%) than that of rats treated with ethanol alone (Fig. 1)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"Pre-treatment with either acetyl-L-carnitine or carnitine, both resulted in a marked decrease in total FAEE levels in all organs studied compared with the group of animals receiving ethanol alone." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine decreased FAEE levels significantly compared to ethanol alone, and this decrease was mainly accounted for by a sparing of unsaturated fatty acids." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"no statistical differences were observed between the L-carnitine treated group and the acetyl-L-carnitine treated group." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"Pre-treatments with either acetyl-L-carnitine or L-carnitine were efficacious in decreasing FAEE levels in kidney, although neither compound was significantly better than the other in this respect." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"Ethanol administration led to a significant increase in the GSH S-transferase activity which (compared to the control group) was approximately 8-fold in the brain, 5-fold in the heart, 2-fold in the kidney and 3-fold in the liver respectively." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"Pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine significantly reduced the ethanol-induced increases of GSH S-transferase activity in the brain, heart and kidney, whereas in the liver no significant differences were observed, compared to the group of animals treated with ethanol alone." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:170)
"was significantly better than L-carnitine pre-treatment at protecting against the ethanol-induced increases in GSH S-transferase activity in all organs except the liver, where L-carnitine had the same efficacy as acetyl-L-carnitine." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:171)
However, pretreatment with acetyl-L-carnitine was significantly better than L-carnitine pre-treatment at protecting against the ethanol-induced increases in GSH S-transferase activity in all organs except the liver, where L-carnitine had the same efficacy as acetyl-L-carnitine. (note on p.171)
 
"Ethanol administration significantly increased the levels of lipid hydroperoxides in all tissues studied." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:171)
"However, pre-treatment with either acetyl-L-carnitine or L-carnitine significantly decreases FAEES activity, although not back to control levels." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:171)
"Interestingly, treatments with L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine, significantly reduced lipid hydroperoxide levels, particularly in brain and heart, but also in the liver and kidney" (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:171)
"Fatty acid ethyl esters have been shown to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in vivo (9), increase lysosomal fragility (22), and decrease incorporation of thymidine into DNA and methionine into new proteins (23)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:172)
"Moreover, FAEE have been shown to be present in human serum many hours after ethanol ingestion and (24), which suggests that their half-life in tissue may be much longer than that of ethanol itself or its oxidation products." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:172)
"Treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine greatly reduced both FAEE and FAEE synthase activity in all organs and this effect was associated with a significant reduction in the levels of lipid hydroperoxides." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)
"suggesting that the carnitine moiety alone account only partially for the observed effects of acetyl-L-carnitine." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)
"Therefore, it is conceivable that the reduced FAEE formation observed after administration of acetyl-L-carnitine could be a consequence of a reduction of free fatty acid levels, since these are considered the natural substrate for enzymatic FAEE synthesis" (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)
"In addition, acetyl-L-carnitine may protect cells from the injurious effect of accumulating acetaldehyde by attenuating ethanol oxidative metabolism." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)
"Our data support the hypothesis that fatty acid ethyl esters are cytotoxic mediators involved in the production of alcohol-dependent cellular damage (28-29)." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)
"In particular this study strongly suggests a role for the use of acetyl-Lcarnitine as a pharmacological tool in the prevention of alcohol-induced cellular/organ damage." (Calabrese, Scapagnini, Catalano, Dinotta, Bates, Calvani and Stella 2001:173)},

However, the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts a dose-dependent effect on the immune system remain poorly understood due to a lack of systematic studies that examine the effect of multiple doses and different time courses. This review will summarize our current understanding of the impact of moderate versus excessive alcohol consumption on the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system derived from both in vitro as well as in vivo studies carried out in humans and animal model studies.},

Residual alcohol effects on physiological and psychological symptoms are commonly experienced the morning after alcohol consumption. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of L-ornithine on subjective feelings and salivary stress markers the morning after alcohol consumption and to investigate whether L-ornithine acutely accelerates ethanol metabolism.

Methods
This study had a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover design. Subjects were all healthy Japanese adults with the ‘flusher’ phenotype for alcohol tolerance. In experiment 1, 11 subjects drank 0.4 g/kg body weight alcohol 1.5 h before their usual bedtime. Half an hour after drinking, they ingested either a placebo or 400 mg ornithine. The next morning on awakening, subjects completed a questionnaire containing a visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), and a profile of mood states (POMS) and collected a saliva sample for measurement of salivary stress markers (cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A, and α-amylase). In experiment 2, placebo or 400 mg ornithine were administrated to 16 subjects both before and after drinking, and the feeling of drunkenness, breath ethanol concentration and one-leg standing time were repeatedly investigated until 180 min after alcohol consumption.

Results
There were significant decreases in “awareness”, “feeling of fatigue” and “lassitude” VAS scores and in “anger-hostility” and “confusion” POMS scores and a significant increase in “sleep length” in the OSA-MA test. Salivary cortisol concentrations on awakening were reduced after ornithine supplementation. There were no differences between ornithine and placebo in any of the subjective or physiological parameters of acute alcohol metabolism.

Conclusions
Taking 400 mg ornithine after alcohol consumption improved various negative feelings and decreased the salivary stress marker cortisol the next morning. These effects were not caused by an increase in acute alcohol metabolism.},

The study objective was to compare the cooling rates of CCP applied to these traditional areas vs the glabrous skin surfaces of the cheeks, palms, and soles in exercise-induced hyperthermia.

Traditional cooling followed a linear decline (ΔT{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreateres{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater = 0.17 ± 0.04 C/10 min; P {\textbackslash}textless.001).

Conclusions Application of CCP to glabrous skin surfaces was more effective for treating exercise-induced heat stress than the traditional CCP cooling intervention.

	abstract = {Computational models of learning typically train on labeled input patterns (supervised learning), unlabeled input patterns (unsupervised learning), or a combination of the two (semi-supervised learning). In each case input patterns have a fixed number of features throughout training and testing. Human and machine learning contexts present additional opportunities for expanding incomplete knowledge from formal training, via self-directed learning that incorporates features not previously experienced. This article defines a new self-supervised learning paradigm to address these richer learning contexts, introducing a neural network called self-supervised ARTMAP. Self-supervised learning integrates knowledge from a teacher (labeled patterns with some features), knowledge from the environment (unlabeled patterns with more features), and knowledge from internal model activation (self-labeled patterns). Self-supervised ARTMAP learns about novel features from unlabeled patterns without destroying partial knowledge previously acquired from labeled patterns. A category selection function bases system predictions on known features, and distributed network activation scales unlabeled learning to prediction confidence. Slow distributed learning on unlabeled patterns focuses on novel features and confident predictions, defining classification boundaries that were ambiguous in the labeled patterns. Self-supervised ARTMAP improves test accuracy on illustrative low-dimensional problems and on high-dimensional benchmarks.

Low alcohol consumption improved left ventricular contractility. This was accompanied by reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) superoxide dismutase (SOD-3) activity, and elevated nuclear respiratory factors (NRF)1/2, Forkhead box proteinO1 (FOXO-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), and Akt expression, as well as an increase in cardiomyocyte survival. In contrast, high blood alcohol led to an increase in H2O2 level and SOD-3 activity, and a decrease in NRF1/2, FOXO-1, NF-kB, and Akt expression, resulting in a decrease in cardiomyocyte survival.


Together, these findings suggest that low and high blood alcohol may produce opposite effects on cardiomyocytes.

PLAT immunohistochemistry data revealed a significant increase in mast cells and neutrophils in rats after alcohol exposure. These results suggest that acute alcohol exposure results in increased mesenteric lymphatic permeability and PLAT inflammation.

In this study, the effects of 20 nonalcoholic beverages on alcohol metabolism and liver injury caused by alcohol were evaluated in mice. Kunming mice were orally fed with alcohol (52\%, v/v) and beverages. The concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood as well as the activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in liver were assessed to indicate alcohol metabolism. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in serum as well as the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver were measured to reflect the alcohol-induced liver injury. The results showed that the treatment of soda water, green tea and honey chrysanthemum tea could accelerate ethanol metabolism and prevent liver injuries caused by alcohol when companied with excessive alcohol drinking. They might be potential dietary supplements for the alleviation of harmful effects from excessive alcohol consumption. On the contrary, some beverages such as fresh orange juice and red bull are not advised to drink when companied with alcohol consumption due to their adverse effects on ethanol induced liver injury.},

More than 90\% of alcohol is metabolized in the liver, with small fractions being excreted in the breath (0.7\%), sweat (0.1\%), and urine (0.3\%) [8].


The primary mediators of adverse effects caused by excessive alcohol consumption appear to be oxidative stress and ethanol’s first metabolite, acetaldehyde [10].
},
	annote = {
The results suggested that these beverages that influenced the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood were not by means of changing ADH and ALDH activities, but through other ways, such as non-enzymatic ways, which could inhibit the absorption of ethanol in the stomach and intestine or accelerate the excretion of ethanol through breath and urine.


Therefore, beverages such as iced black tea and soda water which could boost the ALDH activity so as to decrease the content of acetaldehyde in blood might possess the capacity of accelerating the metabolism of alcohol and be beneficial in reducing the harm from excessive alcohol consumption. On the contrary, due to the evident inhibition of ALDH activity, the groups of coca cola, honey citron tea, water chestnut juice, jasmine tea, and fresh orange juice showed higher level of acetaldehyde in blood than the control.

	abstract = {Endurance sports are increasing in popularity and athletes at all levels are looking for ways to optimize their performance by training and nutrition. For endurance exercise lasting 30 min or more, the most likely contributors to fatigue are dehydration and carbohydrate depletion, whereas gastrointestinal problems, hyperthermia, and hyponatraemia can reduce endurance exercise performance and are potentially health threatening, especially in longer events ({\textbackslash}textgreater4 h). Although high muscle glycogen concentrations at the start may be beneficial for endurance exercise, this does not necessarily have to be achieved by the traditional supercompensation protocol. An individualized nutritional strategy can be developed that aims to deliver carbohydrate to the working muscle at a rate that is dependent on the absolute exercise intensity as well as the duration of the event. Endurance athletes should attempt to minimize dehydration and limit body mass losses through sweating to 2-3\% of body mass. Gastrointestinal problems occur frequently, especially in long-distance races. Problems seem to be highly individual and perhaps genetically determined but may also be related to the intake of highly concentrated carbohydrate solutions, hyperosmotic drinks, as well as the intake of fibre, fat, and protein. Hyponatraemia has occasionally been reported, especially among slower competitors with very high intakes of water or other low sodium drinks. Here I provide a comprehensive overview of recent research findings and suggest several new guidelines for the endurance athlete on the basis of this. These guidelines are more detailed and allow a more individualized approach.},

Complexes containing zinc have been reported to have better ability to protect gastric mucosa than the compounds alone. In this study, taurine zinc [Zn(NH3CH2CH2SO3)2] solid dispersions (SDs) were synthesized and investigated in an ethanol-induced ulcer model in rats. Gastric ulcer index; gastric mucosa malondialdehyde (MDA) level, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production; and serum nitric oxide (NO) were assessed and histological analysis of the gastric mucosa tissue was performed. Taurine zinc (100, 200 mg/kg) SDs protected rat gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced injury. Moreover, the gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc SDs was accompanied by a decrease in serum NO and significant increase in gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). When indomethacin, a non-selective COX inhibitor was administered before the last dose of taurine zinc, the gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc was weakened. Furthermore, taurine zinc (200 mg/kg) SDs protected against ulceration more significantly than the same dose of taurine alone, suggesting a synergistic effect between taurine and zinc. These results indicate taurine zinc protects the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced damage by elevating antioxidants, decreasing lipid peroxidation and inhibiting the production of nitric oxide. The gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc was also partially mediated by endogenous PGE2 production.},

Ethanol consumption elevated serum triglyceride and TNFα levels, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and lipid accumulation in liver. The oxyradical scavenging capacity of liver was reduced, and expression of CD14, TNFα, COX-2, and iNOS mRNAs was induced markedly. These ethanol-induced changes were all inhibited effectively by betaine supplementation. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and glutathione levels, reduced in the ethanol-fed rats, were increased by betaine supplementation. Methionine adenosyltransferase and cystathionine γ-lyase were induced, but cysteine dioxygenase was down-regulated, which appeared to account for the increment in cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis in the rats supplemented with betaine. Betaine supplementation for the final 2 wk of ethanol intake resulted in a similar degree of hepatoprotection, revealing its potential therapeutic value in alcoholic liver.

Male SD rats were fed for 8 wk a liquid form of a control diet (CD), an ethanol diet (ED), or a taurine-supplemented ethanol diet (TED). Plasma Se and Mn concentrations were significantly lower in the ED rats than in the CD rats; dietary taurine supplementation corrected alcohol-induced decreases in plasma Se and Mn levels. Chronic alcohol consumption significantly increased urinary excretion of Se (a 53\% increase, p {\textless} 0.05), Cr (a 62\% increase, p {\textless} 0.05), Mn (a 45\% increase, p {\textless} 0.05) and Cu (a 30\% increase, p {\textless} 0.05) in rats.

We describe environmental and genetic factors that can influence the production of secondary metabolites.

Four studies that specifically addressed glutamine safety were identified, from which it was concluded that glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. However, the published studies of safety have not fully taken account of chronic consumption by healthy subjects of all age groups. To help identify potential undetected hazards of glutamine intake, the literature on adverse effects of high dietary intake of protein and other amino acids was examined. High protein is reputed to cause nausea, vomiting and ultimately death in adults, and has been shown to result in neurological damage in preterm infants. Individual amino acids cause a variety of adverse effects, some of them potentially fatal, but neurological effects were the most frequently observed. Because glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, psychological and behavioral testing may be especially important.},

	abstract = {Among the members of the mitochondrial carrier family, there are transporters that catalyze the translocation of ornithine and related substrates, such as arginine, homoarginine, lysine, histidine, and citrulline, across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial carriers ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 from Homo sapiens, BAC1 and BAC2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Ort1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been biochemically characterized by transport assays in liposomes. All of them transport ornithine and amino acids with side chains terminating at least with one amine. There are, however, marked differences in their substrate specificities including their affinity for ornithine (KM values in the mM to μM range). These differences are most likely reflected by minor differences in the substrate binding sites of these carriers. The physiological role of the above-mentioned mitochondrial carriers is to link several metabolic pathways that take place partly in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondrial matrix and to provide basic amino acids for mitochondrial translation. In the liver, human ORC1 catalyzes the citrulline/ornithine exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is required for the urea cycle. Human ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis and transport of arginine, which can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of NO, agmatine, polyamines, creatine, glutamine, glutamate, and proline, as well as in the degradation of basic amino acids. BAC1 and BAC2 are implicated in some processes similar to those of their human counterparts and in nitrogen and amino acid metabolism linked to stress conditions and the development of plants. Ort1p is involved in the biosynthesis of arginine and polyamines in yeast.},

Five neonatal treatments groups were used, including ETOH (6.0 g/kg/day), AG (20 mg/kg), ETOH plus AG (6.0 g/kg/day and 20 mg/kg), a maltose control, and a non-treated control. Ethanol was administered via oral intubation twice daily for eight days, (AG was administered with the last ETOH intubation only). Two exposure periods were used; PND 1–8 or PND 8–15. On PND 31–33, balance performance on a single dowel was tested. Treatment with AG during withdrawal in ETOH exposed animals improved performance relative to ETOH alone among the PND 1–8 exposure period. ETOH exposure during the 2nd postnatal week did not impair balance. These findings provide further support that exposure to ETOH during critical developmental periods can impair performance on a cerebellar-dependent balance task. Of perhaps greater significance, co-administration of agmatine reduced these deficits suggesting that NMDA modulation via polyamine blockade may provide a novel approach to attenuating damage associated with binge-like ETOH consumption.},

Understanding how neuromodulators drive the associated learning and memory processes, including memory consolidation, retrieval/expression, and extinction (recall), is essential in the understanding of (individual differences in vulnerability to) these disorders and their treatment. The human and rodent studies I review here together reveal, amongst others, that acute selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment facilitates fear conditioning, reduces contextual fear, and increases cued fear, chronic SSRI treatment reduces both contextual and cued fear, 5-HT1A receptors inhibit the acquisition and expression of contextual fear, 5-HT2A receptors facilitates the consolidation of cued and contextual fear, inactivation of 5-HT2C receptors facilitate the retrieval of cued fear memory, the 5-HT3 receptor mediates contextual fear, genetically induced increases in serotonin levels are associated with increased fear conditioning, impaired cued fear extinction, or impaired extinction recall, and that genetically induced 5-HT depletion increases fear conditioning and contextual fear. Several explanations are presented to reconcile seemingly paradoxical relationships between serotonin levels and conditioned fear.},

	abstract = {Death is our most repressed consciousness, it inheres our condition as the primordial fear. Perhaps it was necessary that this angst be repressed in man or he would be hurled against the dark forces of nature. Modern ethos was built on this edifice, where the 'denial of death' while 'embracing one's symbolic immortality' would be worshipped, so this ideology simply overturned and repressed looking into the morass of the inevitable when it finally announced itself. Once this slowly pieced its way into all of life, 'death' would soon become a terminology in medicine too and assert its position, by giving a push to those directly dealing with the dying to shy away from its emotional and spiritual affliction. The need to put off death and prolong one's life would become ever more urgent. Research using psychedelics on the terminally ill which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s would coerce into another realm and alter the face of medicine; but the aggression with which it forced itself in the 1960s would soon be politically maimed, and what remained would be sporadic outpours that trickled its way from European labs and underground boot camps. Now, with the curtain rising, the question has etched itself again, about the use of psychedelic drugs in medicine, particularly psychedelic psychotherapy with the terminally ill. This study is an attempt to philosophically explore death anxiety from its existential context and how something that is innate in our condition cannot be therapeutically cured. Psychedelic use was immutably linked with ancient cultures and only recently has it seen its scientific revival, from which a scientific culture grew around psychedelic therapy. How much of what was threaded in the ritual and spiritual mores can be extricated and be interpreted in our own mechanized language of medicine is the question that nudges many.},

 In the present study, we find that concurrent exposure of hepatocytes to fructose and ethanol stimulates an upregulation of mitoneet expression. However, the increased expression of mitoneet primes the cell for TNFa-mediated necroptosis.In hepatocytes exposed to fructose and ethanol, treatment with TNF a activates a STAT3–Grim-19 complex, which binds to mitoneet, resulting in a rapid discharge of the mitoneet 2Fe-2S cluster, a dramatic accumulation of mitochondrial iron, ROS production and cytotoxicity.

	abstract = {Activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was investigated in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol administration by single-cell extracellular recordings from dopaminergic neurons of the ventrotegmental area, coupled with antidromic identification from the nucleus accumbens, and by microdialysis-technique experiments in the nucleus accumbens. Spontaneous firing rates, spikes per burst, and absolute burst firing but not the number of spontaneously active neurons were found drastically reduced; whereas absolute and relative refractory periods increased in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol treatment as compared with chronic saline-treated controls. Consistently, dopamine outflow in the nucleus accumbens and its acid metabolites were reduced after abruptly stopping chronic ethanol administration. All these changes, as well as ethanol-withdrawal behavioral signs, were reversed by ethanol administration. This reversal suggests that the abrupt cessation of chronic ethanol administration plays a causal role in the reduction of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity seen in the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. Results indicate that during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is tonically reduced in activity, as indexed by electrophysiological and biochemical criteria. Considering the role of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the reinforcing properties of ethanol, the depressed activity of this system during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome may be relevant to the dysphoric state associated with ethanol withdrawal in humans.},

The activity of ADH, not MEOS, was significantly inhibited by acetylcarnitine at NAD : acetylcarnitine ≤ 1. The inhibition is of a competitive nature where acetylcarnitine competes with NAD+ (Ki = 135 μmol.L−1).

In the present study, three mechanisms regulating human agmatine homeostasis were investigated. 1) Enzymatic regulation: expression of arginine decarboxylase, diamine oxidase, and ornithine decarboxylase in human colon neoplastic tissue was, at the mRNA level, about 75\% and 50\% lower and 150\% higher, respectively, than in the adjacent normal tissue; expression of agmatinase was unchanged. 2) Bacteria-derived agmatine: ten representative bacteria strains of the human intestinal microbiota considerably differed in agmatine production and its efflux into their surrounding fluid, suggesting that the composition of the intestinal microbiota influences the agmatine availability in the gut lumen for absorption. 3) Regulation of blood plasma agmatine concentration by the human liver: at low concentrations in portal venous blood plasma, agmatine either slightly increased or further decreased in blood plasma through liver passage. Above a threshold of 14 ng/ml agmatine in the portal venous blood plasma, substantial hepatic agmatine removal from blood occurred. Taken together, a perturbation of agmatine homeostasis has been proven to be involved in the regulation of malignant cell proliferation. The amount of agmatine available for absorption, which is an important physiological source of agmatine in the human organism, should differ considerably depending on the composition of the bacterial flora in the chyme since the various species of intestinal bacteria largely differ in their ability to form agmatine. Finally, evidence has been presented that the liver plays a crucial physiological role in the maintenance of agmatine homeostasis in the human organism.},

	abstract = {Aims To investigate whether the relative amounts of fat, carbohydrate (CHO), or protein in a meal influence the pharmacokinetics of a small dose of ethanol.
				, 
						Methods Nine healthy men received ethanol (0.30 g kg−1 body weight) on five occasions in a randomized cross-over fashion. On three occasions the dose of ethanol was consumed within 15 min of eating a standardized breakfast of similar volume and calorific value but containing different amounts of fat, CHO, and protein. On two other occasions the same dose of ethanol was ingested on an empty stomach (overnight fast) or administered by intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 30 min.
				, 
						Results The blood-ethanol profiles showed large inter and intraindividual variations, especially when ethanol was ingested after eating food. The peak blood-alcohol concentrations (BAC) were 16.6±4.0, 17.7±7.1, and 13.3±4.0 mg dl−1 (mean±s.d.) after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals and 30.8±4.3 and 54.3±6.4 mg dl−1 after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The corresponding areas under the concentration-time profiles (AUC) were 1767±549, 1619±760, 1270±406 mg dl−1 min after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals compared with 3210±527 and 4786±446 mg dl−1 min after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The time required to eliminate ethanol from the blood was shortened by 1–2 h in the fed-state.
				, 
						Conclusions Drinking ethanol after eating a meal, regardless of the nutritional composition, decreases the systemic availability of ethanol. Because gastric emptying is slow and more prolonged with food in the stomach, the delivery of ethanol to the duodenum and the liver will be highly variable as will the hepatic clearance of ethanol. Provided that portal venous BAC remains fairly low and ethanol metabolizing enzymes are not fully saturated then part of the dose of ethanol can be cleared by hepatic first-pass metabolism (FPM), as one consequence of Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics.},

Two binary mixtures melting near the ambient temperature were studied: (a) 0.925 Ca(NO3)2 - 4.06 H2O + 0.075 CaCl2 - 6.11 H2O melting at 35.6 deg.C and (b) 0.9 CH v3CONH2 + 0.1 Ca(NO3)2 - 4 H2O, melting at 27.7 deg.C. The melting temperature, the enthalpy offusion and the heat capacity of both mixtures were determined from DSC measurements. Both mixtures showed to be suitable solvents for theformation of consecutive cobalt(II) chloride complexes. The compositions of the complex compounds were adjusted in each mixture so that the absorption spectra in visible spectral range exhibited low absorbance at the melting temperature and a pronounced increase of the absorbance and/or change of color with the increase of temperature in the range relevant for passive solar energy receivers. The combined latent heat storage and the outstanding reversible change of the optical properties of the dissolved complex compounds with temperature is proposed to be applied in solar heated agricultural greenhouses in areas with fluctuating climate conditions. The increase of absorbance with.temperature acts as an auto-regulated shading protection from overheating. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

Ethanol exposure activates signaling pathways featuring high-mobility group box 1 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in induction of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, which regulates expression of several cytokine genes involved in innate immunity, and its target genes. This leads to persistent neuroimmune responses to ethanol that stimulate TLRs and/or certain glutamate receptors (i.e., N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors). Alcohol also alters stress responses, causing elevation of peripheral cytokines, which further sensitize neuroimmune responses to ethanol. Neuroimmune signaling and glutamate excitotoxicity are linked to alcoholic neurodegeneration. Models of alcohol abuse have identified significant frontal cortical degeneration and loss of hippocampal neurogenesis, consistent with neuroimmune activation pathology contributing to these alcohol-induced, long-lasting changes in the brain. These alcohol-induced long-lasting increases in brain neuroimmune-gene expression also may contribute to the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is well known that enhanced heat shock protein expression protects organisms against morbidity and mortality following experimental injury/illness. Presently, chemical/gene therapy based laboratory methods of enhancing heat shock protein expression are impractical for clinical application. Our laboratory has shown glutamine enhances heat shock protein expression following models of experimental illness/injury. The purpose of this review is to examine recent data supporting the use of glutamine as a clinically relevant enhancer of heat shock protein expression.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies indicate glutamine induces heat shock protein-70, HO-1 (heat shock protein-32), and heat shock protein-27 in models of illness/injury. Enhanced expression of heat shock proteins correlates with improved outcome in these models. Further, in-vitro data reveal glutamine enhances DNA binding of heat shock factor-1 (heat shock protein transcription factor) to its promoter. Finally, recently published pilot data show that glutamine enhances serum heat shock protein-70 expression in critically ill patients and this enhanced expression correlates with improved outcome.
SUMMARY: Currently, extensive data support glutamine as a gene level regulator of heat shock protein expression. Glutamine depletion, following critical illness/injury, is likely to lead to a state in which organisms are unable to induce heat shock proteins appropriately. Further, pharmacologic supplementation of glutamine potentiates the heat shock protein response prior to and following a stress. Pharmacologic trials utilizing glutamine to enhance heat shock proteins in humans are indicated.},

Because the ADH and ALDH2 reactions reduce NAD+ to NADH, the cellular NAD+/NADH redox ratio is lowered as a consequence of ethanol metabolism.

In general, there is little difference in the rate of absorption of the same dose of alcohol administered in the form of different alcoholic beverage i.e., blood ethanol concentration is not significantly influenced by the type of alcoholic beverage consumed.


The major factor governing the absorption rate of alcohol is whether the drink is taken on an empty stomach or together with or after a meal
},
	annote = {
KEY POINTS
    The equilibrium concentration of alcohol in a tissue depends on the relative water content of that tissue.    The rate of alcohol absorption depends on the rate of gastric emptying, the concentration of alcohol and is more rapid in the fasted state.    The blood alcohol concentration is determined by the amount of alcohol consumed,the presence or absence of food and the rate of alcohol metabolism.    First pass metabolism of alcohol occurs in the stomach and is decreased in alcoholics.    Liver alcohol dehydrogenase is the major enzyme system for metabolizing alcohol; this requires the cofactor NAD and the products produced are acetaldehyde and NADH.    The acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetate, the same final metabolite produced from all other nutrients-carbohydrates, fats and proteins; the acetate can be converted to CO2, fatty acids, ketone bodies, cholesterol and steroids.    Oxidation of alcohol by cytochrome P450 pathways, especially CYP2E1 which is induced by alcohol, are secondary pathways to remove alcohol especially at high concentrations.    Alcohol metabolism is regulated by the nutritional state, the concentration of alcohol,specific isoforms of alcohol dehyrogenase, need to remove acetaldehyde and regenerate NAD and induction of CYP2E1.    Substrate shuttles and the mitochondrial respiratory chain are required to regenerate NAD from NADH, and this can limit the overall rate of alcohol metabolism.    Metabolism of alcohol is increased in alcoholics without liver disease: this metabolic tolerance to alcohol may involve induction of CYP2E1, elevated regeneration of NAD or endotoxemia.

Several drugs, including H2 receptor blockers such as cimetidine or ranitidine, or aspirin inhibit stomach ADH activity. This will decrease first pass metabolism by the stomach, and hence, increase blood alcohol concentrations.


The overall significance of first pass metabolism by the stomach is controversial.


Whereas metabolism of the major nutrients is under hormonal control, e.g insulin/glucagon, leptin, catecholamine, thyroid hormones, generally, there is little hormonal regulation to pace the rate of alcohol elimination.


Animals with small body weight metabolize alcohol at faster rates than larger animals e.g. the rate of alcohol elimination in mice is 5 times greater than the rate in humans.


However, it is important to note that alcohol-derived calories are produced at the expense of the metabolism of normal nutrients since alcohol will be oxidized preferentially over other nutrients (19–23).

SYNOPSIS
This review describes the pathways and factors which modulate blood alcohol (alcohol and ethanol are used interchangeably) levels and alcohol metabolism and describe how the body disposes of alcohol. The various factors which play a role in the distribution of alcohol in the body, influence the absorption of alcohol and contribute to first pass metabolism of alcohol will be described. Most alcohol is oxidized in the liver and general principles and overall mechanisms for alcohol oxidation will be summarized. The kinetics of alcohol elimination in-vivo and the various genetic and environmental factors which can modify the rate of alcohol metabolism will be discussed. The enzymatic pathways responsible for ethanol metabolism, in particular, the human alcohol dehydrogenase alleles will be described. Rate-limiting steps in the overall metabolism of ethanol, including the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase isoforms, and the necessity to reoxidize NADH by substrate shuttle pathways and the mitochondrial respiratory chain will be discussed. The impact of alcohol metabolism on other liver metabolic pathways, and on cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs will be briefly described. Factors playing a role in the metabolic adaptation i.e., increased rate of ethanol metabolism by chronic alcoholics will be discussed. The metabolism and role of acetaldehyde in the toxic actions of alcohol and ethanol drinking behavior will be discussed. Despite much knowledge of alcohol pharmacokinetics and metabolism, numerous questions remain for further evaluation and research, including what regulates alcohol metabolism in-vivo, the role of alcohol metabolites in organ damage, functions and physiological substrates of the various ADH isoforms, population and gender differences in alcohol metabolism, need for developing markers to identify individuals susceptible to alcohol and other considerations are discussed.

The Km of CYP2E1 for alcohol is 10 mM ,10-fold higher than the Km of ADH for ethanol but still within the range of alcohol concentrations seen in social drinking. At low alcohol concentrations, CYP2E1 may account for about 10\% of the total alcohol oxidizing capacity of the liver.
},
	annote = {
The low Km mitochondrial ALDH oxidizes most of the acetaldehyde produced from the oxidation of alcohol, although in human liver, the class I cytosolic ALDH may also contribute (75).


Acetaldehyde can also be oxidized by aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and by CYP2E1, but these are insignificant pathways.


In general, the capacity of ALDH to remove acetaldehyde exceeds the capacity of acetaldehyde generation by the various pathways of alcohol oxidation. Therefore, circulating levels of acetaldehyde are usually very low.

The development of AUD involves repeated alcohol use leading to tolerance, alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), physical and psychological dependence, with loss of ability to control excessive drinking. Currently there is no effective therapeutic agent for AUD without major side-effects. Dihydromyricetin (DHM, 1 mg/kg, i.p. injection), a flavonoid component of herbal medicines, counteracted acute alcohol (EtOH) intoxication, and also withdrawal signs in rats including tolerance, increased anxiety and seizure susceptibility; DHM greatly reduced EtOH consumption in an intermittent voluntary EtOH intake paradigm in rats. GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are major targets of acute and chronic EtOH actions on the brain. At the cellular levels, DHM (1 μM) antagonized both acute EtOH-induced potentiation of GABAARs and EtOH exposure/withdrawal-induced GABAAR plasticity, including alterations in responsiveness of extra- and post-synaptic GABAARs to acute EtOH, and most importantly, increases in GABAAR α4 subunit expression in hippocampus and cultured neurons. DHM anti-alcohol effects on both behavior and CNS neurons were antagonized by flumazenil (10 mg/kg in vivo, 10 μM in vitro), the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist. DHM competitively inhibited BZ-site [3H]flunitrazepam binding (IC50, 4.36 μM), suggesting DHM interaction with EtOH involves the BZ-sites on GABAARs. In summary, we determined DHM anti-alcoholic effects on animal models, and determined a major molecular target and cellular mechanism of DHM for counteracting alcohol intoxication and dependence. We demonstrated pharmacological properties of DHM consistent with those expected to underlie successful medical treatment of AUD; therefore DHM is a therapeutic candidate.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Although hangover results from excessive alcohol consumption, the specific pathways through which hangover symptoms arise have not been elucidated. Research on predictors of hangover sensitivity may provide clues about such mechanisms. The present study investigated whether tobacco smoking on days of heavy drinking affects next-day hangover incidence and severity.

Method:
The study drew on diary data from a study on smoking and drinking among 113 students at a midwestern university in the United States. Participants completed a daily, web-based, 26-item survey for 8 weeks to assess prior-day alcohol and tobacco use as well as current-day hangover symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test the hypothesis that amount of smoking is related to hangover, controlling for amount of alcohol consumed, sex, and other individual characteristics. Analyses were conducted after selecting only days with alcohol consumption levels that typically elicit hangover, then repeated on lighter drinking days for comparison. Validityof the hangover items was checked by comparing reports after such heavy drinking days with days of lighter drinking.

Results:
Across all possible person-days, 92\% of daily reports were obtained. When selecting only events where an estimated blood alcohol concentration of 110 mg/dl was attained, smoking significantly increased the odds of hangover incidence and hangover severity while controlling for number of drinks consumed and sex. Additional analyses controlling for age first smoked regularly, frequency of drug use, type of drug involvement, or smoking status resulted in findings that were unchanged.

Conclusions:
Smoking more on heavy drinking days affects hangover sensitivity and severity, possibly because of acute pharmacological effects.},

We found that oral l-ornithine administration promoted lipid metabolism and activated the urea cycle from serum triacylglycerol, ketone bodies, free fatty acids, and blood ammonia level changing. l-ornithine significantly attenuated the subjective feeling of fatigue (measured by visual analog scale at postrecovery) compared with postload (P {\textless} .01).

While alcohol ingestion can affect many organs and systems, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol ingestion can cause a ‘leaky gut’ syndrome which in turn contributes to infection and systemic organ dysfunction. This study investigated the acute effect of alcohol on gut barrier function. Using an in vivo isolated gut sac model of naïve male rats, each individual gut sac was injected with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40\%, v/v) of alcohol. After different times of alcohol exposure, each isolated gut segment was harvested and intestinal permeability and mucosal surface hydrophobicity (a physiologic marker of mucus barrier function) were measured as well as luminal DNA, mucus, protein and free fatty acids. The results showed that alcohol caused dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in gut permeability and decreases in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, with significant changes to be observed 5 min after treatment with 10\% alcohol. In addition, it is further found that these changes in permeability and hydrophobicity are more closely associated with increased intestinal luminal free fatty acids levels but not protein or DNA levels. These results suggest that alcohol may cause loss of gut barrier function by extracting and dissolving lipids from the mucus with a resultant decrease in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, which is a critical component of gut barrier function.},

The main purpose of this study was to report fluoxetine-induced psoriasis in two Chinese women.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Although both patients had been taking fluoxetine for an extended period of time, the time scale of these two case studies suggests that fluoxetine played a causative role in these patients' psoriasis.},

We review evidence suggesting that plasticity within the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is critical to the expression of uncontrollable stressor-induced anxiety. Specifically, after uncontrollable stressor exposure subsequent anxiogenic stimuli evoke greater 5-HT release in DRN terminal regions including the amygdala and striatum; and pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors in these regions prevents expression of stressor-induced anxiety. Importantly, the controllability of stress, the presence of safety signals, and a history of exercise mitigate the expression of stressor-induced anxiety. These stress-protective factors appear to involve distinct neural substrates; with stressor controllability requiring the medial prefrontal cortex, safety signals the insular cortex and exercise affecting the 5-HT system directly. Knowledge of the distinct yet converging mechanisms underlying these stress-protective factors could provide insight into novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of stress-related psychiatric disorders.},

In the present study, the effect of acetaldehyde on tyrosine phosphorylation, immmunofluorescence localization, and detergent-insoluble fractions of the tight junction and the adherens junction proteins was determined in the human colonic mucosa. The role of EGF and l-glutamine in prevention of acetaldehyde-induced effects was also evaluated. Acetaldehyde reduced the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, thereby increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. The levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin in detergent-insoluble fractions were reduced by acetaldehyde, while it increased their levels in detergent-soluble fractions. Pretreatment with EGF or l-glutamine prevented acetaldehyde-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, redistribution from intercellular junctions, and reduction in the levels of detergent-insoluble fractions of occludin, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. These results demonstrate that acetaldehyde induces tyrosine phosphorylation and disrupts tight junction and adherens junction in human colonic mucosa, which can be prevented by EGF and glutamine.},

Results show that 1) acetaldehyde inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and slightly elevates the activation of p60c-Src and p125FAK, resulting in an increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human colonic mucosa; 2) acetaldehyde increases tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, E-cadherin, and β-catenin; 3) acetaldehyde reduces the levels of detergent-insoluble fractions of TJ and AJ proteins, leading to redistribution of these proteins from the intercellular junctions; and 4) both EGF and l-glutamine prevent the acetaldehyde-induced changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the levels of detergent-insoluble TJ and AJ proteins, and redistribution of these proteins from the intercellular junctions.


The protective effect of l-glutamine on acetaldehyde-induced permeability is mediated by EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity (25).

	abstract = {Aim: To investigate in social drinkers the effects of a ‘normal’ evening of drinking alcohol on cognitive performance. Methods: Aiming for ecological validity, the study required participants to consume their usual quantity of any type of alcoholic beverage in their chosen company (hangover situation). However, the timing of drinking was restricted to the period between 22:00 and 02:00 hours on the night before testing. Testing included memory and psychomotor performance tests; testing was also performed after an evening of abstinence (no hangover situation), following a counterbalanced design using repeated measures, with time of testing (09:00, 11:00 and 13:00 hours) and order of testing (hangover/no hangover; no hangover/hangover) as ‘between participant’ factors in the analysis. Results: Forty-eight social drinkers (33 women, 15 men) aged between 18 and 43 years were tested, with a 1-week interval between test sessions. The morning after alcohol (mean consumption: 14.7 units for men; 10.4 units for women), free recall was impaired at 09:00 hours and delayed recognition and psychomotor performance were impaired throughout the morning, despite blood alcohol levels of zero or very near zero. Conclusion: Memory and psychomotor performance is impaired on the morning after heavy ‘social’ drinking.},

	abstract = {Although it has been speculated that active oxidants and mitochondrial membrane damages play roles in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damages, its detail remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether ethanol induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) before cell death of gastric mucosal cells. Rat gastric mucosal cells (RGM-1) were kept in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before addition of various concentrations of ethanol. Nuclear morphological aftemations and membrane barrier dysfunction of RGM-1 cells were assessed by staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide, respectively. To assess the contribution of oxygen-derived free radicals and intracellular glutathione, scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical, N,N-dimethylthiourea, glutathione precursor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-methylpyrazole were added before treatment with ethanol. To investigate MPT, calcein and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester were loaded before addition of ethanol, and the changes of fluorescence intensity were monitored using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Ethanol ({\textgreater}5\% v/v) dose-dependently increased the number of propidium iodide-positive cells, suggesting a diminished barrier function of cell membrane. After addition of ethanol, mitochondria were filled quickly with calcein indicating MPT, which was accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization, as shown by loss of tetramethylrodamine methyl ester before cell death. Ethanol-induced cell death was significantly attenuated by simultaneous incubation with either N,N-dimethylthiourea or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting the importance of intracellular redox states in inducing cellular damage, whereas such change was not attenuated by 4-methylpyrazole. Present results suggest that ethanol treatment induces intracellular oxidative stress and produces MPT and mitochondrial depolarization, which are preceding cell death in gastric mucosal cells. Intracellular antioxidants, such as glutathione, may have a significant protective action against ethanol in gastric mucosal cells.},

The effects of fructose and glucose on the metabolic changes induced by ethanol and on the intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover were studied in 109 healthy male volunteers. After 10 hours of fasting, the subjects were given 1.75 g of ethanol per kg body wt during 3 hours under controlled laboratory conditions. Fructose or glucose were administered either simultaneously with ethanol or 12 hours later during the hangover period. The intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover were estimated 10 times during the experimental period of 20 hours using subjective and objective rating scales. Sequential determinations of blood ethanol, acetaldehyde, glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, triglycerides, ketone bodies and capillary blood acid-base balance were also made during the experiment. Under these experimental conditions neither fructose nor glucose had any significant effect on the intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover. The sugars also had no significant effect on the rate of ethanol elimination or on the blood acetaldehyde concentration during the course of the experiment. Blood glucose concentration was decreased and blood lactate, free fatty acid and ketone body concentrations were increased during the hangover period in the subjects who had been given only ethanol. These subjects also had a marked metabolic acidosis during hangover. Glucose and fructose significantly inhibited the metabolic alterations induced by ethanol. In this respect fructose was more effective than glucose. The results indicate that both fructose and glucose effectively inhibit the metabolic disturbances induced by ethanol but they do not affect the symptoms or signs of alcohol intoxication and hangover. The results support the view that hangover is not directly related to the metabolic effects of ethanol or to its metabolic products.},

The pharmacological and biochemical properties and therapeutic applications of simple coumarins depend upon the pattern of substitution. Coumarins have attracted intense interest in recent years because of their diverse pharmacological properties. Among these properties, their cytotoxic effects were most extensively examined. In this review, their broad range of effects on the tumors as shown by various in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical studies are discussed. Hence, these cytotoxic coumarins represent an exploitable source of new anticancer agents, which might also help addressing side-toxicity and resistance phenomena. These natural compounds have served as valuable leads for further design and synthesis of more active analogues. In this review, plant derived coumarins and their synthetic analogues were systematically evaluated based on their plant origin, structure-activity relationship and anticancer efficacy. Owing the their diverse effects and inconclusive results from different in vitro studies, the mechanism of their action is not yet fully understood and correlation of effects with chemical structures is not conclusive at the moment. It is the objective of this review to summarize experimental data for different coumarins, used as cytotoxic agents, because promising data have been reported for a series of these agents. Yet, the results from different coumarins with various tumor lines are contradictory in part. We therefore conclude that there is still a long way to go until we know which cytotoxic agent will clinically be suitable for what tumor entity for treatment. Their ability to bind metal ions represents an additional means of modulating their pharmacological responses.},

	abstract = {Background
This study evaluated sex and family history of alcoholism as moderators of subjective ratings of sleepiness/sleep quality and polysomnography following alcohol intoxication in healthy, young adults.

Methods
Ninety-three healthy adults (mean age 24.4 ± 2.7 years, 59 women, 29 subjects with a positive family history of alcoholism (FH+)) were recruited. Following screening polysomnography, participants consumed alcohol (sex/weight adjusted dosing) to intoxication (peak breath alcohol concentration [BrAC] of 0.11 ± 0.01 g\% for men and women) or matching placebo between 2030 and 2200 hours. Sleep was monitored with polysomnography between 2300 and 0700 hours. Participants completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale at bedtime and on awakening and a validated post-sleep questionnaire.

Results
Following alcohol, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, nighttime awakenings, and wake after sleep onset were more disrupted in women than men, with no differences by family history status. Alcohol reduced sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and REM sleep while increasing wakefulness and Slow Wave Sleep across the entire night compared to placebo. Alcohol also generally increased sleep consolidation in the first half of the night, but decreased it during the second half. Sleepiness ratings were higher following alcohol, particularly in women at bedtime. Morning sleep quality ratings were lower following alcohol than placebo.

Conclusions
Alcohol intoxication increases subjective sleepiness and disrupts sleep objectively more in healthy women than in men, with no differences evident by family history of alcoholism status. Evaluating moderators of alcohol effects on sleep may provide insight into the role of sleep in problem drinking.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of nutraceutical oral administration of L-glutamine (L-Gln) in middle-aged and elderly individuals.
METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, double-blind clinical study, 30 residents of a long-term-care institution, selected according to a modified SENIEUR protocol (Working Party of the EURAGE Concerted Action Programme on Ageing of the European Community), were studied. Fourteen subjects received orally 0.5 g kg(-1) d(-1) of L-Gln and 16 received calcium caseinate for 14 d, followed by a 5-d washout. Supplements were switched for the second 14-d trial. Laboratory tests for hepatic and renal functions and ammonemia were performed and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 30 subjects, 16 were men, mean age was 69+/-8.8 y, average weight was 61.8+/-14.2 kg, and mean serum albumin was 4.0+/-0.3g/dL. Neither adverse clinical effects nor clinically significant laboratory changes were noted during L-Gln supplementation. There was no difference in ammonemia between the groups. There were statistically but not clinically significant increases in plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. There was no significant decrease in eGFR during calcium caseinate supplementation (-2.9\%). The eGFR decreased significantly after L-Gln supplementation (-13.3\%) but well below the 25\% limit for biologic significance.
CONCLUSION: Increases in serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and decrease in eGFR are probably due to difficulties by older kidneys in metabolizing the supplemented protein sources. Although not clinically significant, those alterations impose a rigorous control on the evaluation parameters of renal function during oral L-Gln supplementation, with doses of 0.5 g kg(-1) d(-1) in middle-aged and elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by living organisms as a result of normal cellular metabolism and environmental factors, such as air pollutants or cigarette smoke. ROS are highly reactive molecules and can damage cell structures such as carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins and alter their functions. The shift in the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of oxidants is termed “oxidative stress.” Regulation of reducing and oxidizing (redox) state is critical for cell viability, activation, proliferation, and organ function. Aerobic organisms have integrated antioxidant systems, which include enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants that are usually effective in blocking harmful effects of ROS. However, in pathological conditions, the antioxidant systems can be overwhelmed. Oxidative stress contributes to many pathological conditions and diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/perfusion, diabetes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. In this review, we summarize the cellular oxidant and antioxidant systems and discuss the cellular effects and mechanisms of the oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Modafinil (MOD) and its R-enantiomer (R-MOD) are approved medications for narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. They have also been used, off label, as cognitive enhancers in populations of patients with mental disorders, including substance abusers that demonstrate impaired cognitive function. A debated non-medical use of MOD in healthy individuals to improve intellectual performance is raising questions about its potential abuse liability in this population.

Results and Conclusions
MOD has low micromolar affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT). Inhibition of dopamine (DA) reuptake via the DAT explains the enhancement of DA levels in several brain areas, an effect shared with psychostimulants like cocaine, methylphenidate and the amphetamines. However, its neurochemical effects and anatomical pattern of brain area activation differ from typical psychostimulants and are consistent with its beneficial effects on cognitive performance processes such as attention, learning, and memory. At variance with typical psychostimulants, MOD shows very low, if any, abuse liability, in spite of its use as a cognitive enhancer by otherwise healthy individuals. Finally, recent clinical studies have focused on the potential use of MOD as a medication for treatment of drug abuse, but have not shown consistent outcomes. However, positive trends in several result measures suggest that medications that improve cognitive function, like MOD or R-MOD, may be beneficial for treatment of substance use disorders in certain patient populations.},

Here we tested the hypothesis that supplemental taurine, an amino acid that functions as a chemical chaperone/osmolyte and enhances cellular anti-oxidant activity, would prevent ethanol-induced decreases in adiponectin expression and attenuate liver injury. Serum adiponectin concentrations decreased as early as 4–7 days after feeding rats a 36\% ethanol diet. This rapid decrease was associated with increased oxidative, but not ER, stress in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Taurine prevented ethanol-induced oxidative stress and increased inflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue. Ethanol feeding also rapidly decreased expression of transcription factors regulating adiponectin expression (C/EBPα, PPARγ and PPARα) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Taurine prevented the ethanol-induced decrease in C/EBPα and PPARα normalizing adiponectin mRNA and serum adiponectin concentrations. In the liver, taurine prevented ethanol-induced oxidative stress and attenuated TNF-α expression and steatosis, at least in part, by increasing expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation.},

	abstract = {Background
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the number one cause of chronic liver disease and second indication for liver transplantation in the Western world. Effective therapy is still not available. Previously we showed a critical role for caspase-2 in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the potentially progressive form of NAFLD. An imbalance between free Coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl-CoA ratio is known to induce caspase-2 activation.

Objectives
We aimed to evaluate CoA metabolism and the effects of supplementation with CoA precursors, pantothenate and cysteine, in mouse models of NASH.

Methods
CoA metabolism was evaluated in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) and Western diet mouse models of NASH. MCD-diet fed mice were treated with pantothenate and N-acetylcysteine or placebo to determine effects on NASH.

Results
Liver free CoA content was reduced, pantothenate kinase (PANK), the rate-limiting enzyme in the CoA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated, and CoA degrading enzymes were increased in mice with NASH. Decreased hepatic free CoA content was associated with increased caspase-2 activity, and correlated with worse liver cell apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment with pantothenate and N-acetylcysteine did not inhibit caspase-2 activation, improve NASH, normalize PANK expression, or restore free CoA levels in MCD diet-fed mice.

Conclusion
In mice with NASH, hepatic CoA metabolism is impaired, leading to decreased free CoA content, activation of caspase-2, and increased liver cell apoptosis. Dietary supplementation with CoA precursors did not restore CoA levels or improve NASH, suggesting that alternative approaches are necessary to normalize free CoA during NASH.},

Here, we demonstrate that Gck gene expression and promoter activity in pancreatic β-cells were suppressed by chronic ethanol exposure in vivo and in vitro, whereas expression of activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) and its binding to the putative Atf/Creb site (from −287 to −158 bp) on the Gck promoter were up-regulated. Furthermore, in vitro ethanol-induced Atf3 inhibited the positive effect of Pdx-1 on Gck transcriptional regulation, enhanced recruitment of Hdac1/2 and histone H3 deacetylation, and subsequently augmented the interaction of Hdac1/Pdx-1 on the Gck promoter, which were diminished by Atf3 siRNA. In vivo Atf3-silencing reversed ethanol-mediated Gck down-regulation and β-cell dysfunction, followed by the amelioration of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Together, we identified that ethanol-induced Atf3 fosters β-cell dysfunction via Gck down-regulation and that its loss ameliorates metabolic syndrome and could be a potential therapeutic target in treating type 2 diabetes. The Atf3 gene is associated with the induction of type 2 diabetes and alcohol consumption-induced metabolic impairment and thus may be the major negative regulator for glucose homeostasis.},

Previous studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol use results in increased gut permeability and increased serum endotoxin levels that contribute to many of the biological effects of chronic alcohol, including alcoholic liver disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of acute binge drinking in healthy adults on serum endotoxin levels. We found that acute alcohol binge resulted in a rapid increase in serum endotoxin and 16S rDNA, a marker of bacterial translocation from the gut. Compared to men, women had higher blood alcohol and circulating endotoxin levels. In addition, alcohol binge caused a prolonged increase in acute phase protein levels in the systemic circulation. The biological significance of the in vivo endotoxin elevation was underscored by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, and chemokine, MCP-1, measured in total blood after in vitro lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Our findings indicate that even a single alcohol binge results in increased serum endotoxin levels likely due to translocation of gut bacterial products and disturbs innate immune responses that can contribute to the deleterious effects of binge drinking.},

	abstract = {Latent heat storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy. Unlike the sensible heat storage method, the latent heat storage method provides much higher storage density, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. This paper reviews previous work on latent heat storage and provides an insight to recent efforts to develop new classes of phase change materials (PCMs) for use in energy storage. Three aspects have been the focus of this review: PCM materials, encapsulation and applications. There are large numbers of phase change materials that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. Paraffin waxes are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require large surface area. Hydrated salts have larger energy storage density and higher thermal conductivity but experience supercooling and phase segregation, and hence, their application requires the use of some nucleating and thickening agents. The main advantages of PCM encapsulation are providing large heat transfer area, reduction of the PCMs reactivity towards the outside environment and controlling the changes in volume of the storage materials as phase change occurs. The different applications in which the phase change method of heat storage can be applied are also reviewed in this paper. The problems associated with the application of PCMs with regards to the material and the methods used to contain them are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, is a cognitive and neural theory of how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. This article reviews classical and recent developments of ART, and provides a synthesis of concepts, principles, mechanisms, architectures, and the interdisciplinary data bases that they have helped to explain and predict. The review illustrates that ART is currently the most highly developed cognitive and neural theory available, with the broadest explanatory and predictive range. Central to ART's predictive power is its ability to carry out fast, incremental, and stable unsupervised and supervised learning in response to a changing world. ART specifies mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony during both unsupervised and supervised learning. ART provides functional and mechanistic explanations of such diverse topics as laminar cortical circuitry; invariant object and scenic gist learning and recognition; prototype, surface, and boundary attention; gamma and beta oscillations; learning of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells; computation of homologous spatial and temporal mechanisms in the entorhinal-hippocampal system; vigilance breakdowns during autism and medial temporal amnesia; cognitive-emotional interactions that focus attention on valued objects in an adaptively timed way; item-order-rank working memories and learned list chunks for the planning and control of sequences of linguistic, spatial, and motor information; conscious speech percepts that are influenced by future context; auditory streaming in noise during source segregation; and speaker normalization. Brain regions that are functionally described include visual and auditory neocortex; specific and nonspecific thalamic nuclei; inferotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, hippocampal, parahippocampal, perirhinal, and motor cortices; frontal eye fields; supplementary eye fields; amygdala; basal ganglia: cerebellum; and superior colliculus. Due to the complementary organization of the brain, ART does not describe many spatial and motor behaviors whose matching and learning laws differ from those of ART. ART algorithms for engineering and technology are listed, as are comparisons with other types of models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background
The pre-drinking mood state has been indicated to be an important factor in the mood effects of alcohol. However, for moderate alcohol consumption there are no controlled studies showing this association. Also, the mood effects of consuming alcohol combined with food are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol combined with a meal on ambiance-induced mood states. Furthermore effects on autonomic nervous system activity were measured to explore physiological mechanisms that may be involved in changes of mood state.

Methods
In a crossover design 28 women (age 18–45 y, BMI 18.5–27 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to 4 conditions in which they received 3 glasses of sparkling white wine (30 g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine while having dinner in a room with either a pleasant or unpleasant created ambiance. Subjects filled out questionnaires (B-BAES, POMS and postprandial wellness questionnaire) at different times. Skin conductance and heart rate variability were measured continuously.

Results
Moderate alcohol consumption increased happiness scores in the unpleasant, but not in the pleasant ambiance. Alcohol consumption increased happiness and stimulation feelings within 1 hour and increased sedative feelings and sleepiness for 2.5 hour. Skin conductance was increased after alcohol within 1 hour and was related to happiness and stimulation scores. Heart rate variability was decreased after alcohol for 2 hours and was related to mental alertness.

Conclusion
Mood inductions and autonomic nervous system parameters may be useful to evaluate mood changes by nutritional interventions. Moderate alcohol consumption elevates happiness scores in an unpleasant ambiance. However, drinking alcohol during a pleasant mood results in an equally positive mood state.

	abstract = {In the past, alcoholic liver disease was attributed exclusively to dietary deficiencies, but experimental and judicious clinical studies have now established alcohol's hepatotoxicity. Despite an adequate diet, it can contribute to the entire spectrum of liver diseases, mainly by generating oxidative stress through its microsomal metabolism via cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1). It also interferes with nutrient activation, resulting in changes in nutritional requirements. This is exemplified by methionine, one of the essential amino acids for humans, which needs to be activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a process impaired by liver disease. Thus, SAMe rather than methionine is the compound that must be supplemented in the presence of significant liver disease. In baboons, SAMe attenuated mitochondrial lesions and replenished glutathione; it also significantly reduced mortality in patients with Child A or B cirrhosis. Similarly, decreased phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase activity is associated with alcoholic liver disease, resulting in phosphatidylcholine depletion and serious consequences for the integrity of membranes. This can be offset by polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC), a mixture of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines comprising dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), which has high bioavailability. PPC (and DLPC) opposes major toxic effects of alcohol, with down-regulation of CYP2E1 and reduction of oxidative stress, deactivation of hepatic stellate cells, and increased collagenase activity, which in baboons, results in prevention of ethanol-induced septal fibrosis and cirrhosis. Corresponding clinical trials are ongoing.},

	abstract = {Alcoholic liver disease is associated with zinc decrease in the liver. Therefore, we examined whether dietary zinc supplementation could provide protection from alcoholic liver injury. Metallothionein-knockout and wild-type 129/Sv mice were pair-fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 12 weeks, and the effects of zinc supplementation on ethanol-induced liver injury were analyzed. Zinc supplementation attenuated ethanol-induced hepatic zinc depletion and liver injury as measured by histopathological and ultrastructural changes, serum alanine transferase activity, and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α in both metallothionein-knockout and wild-type mice, indicating a metallothionein-independent zinc protection. Zinc supplementation inhibited accumulation of reactive oxygen species, as indicated by dihydroethidium fluorescence, and the consequent oxidative damage, as assessed by immunohistochemical detection of 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine and quantitative analysis of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in the liver. Zinc supplementation suppressed ethanol-elevated cytochrome P450 2E1 activity but increased the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, without affecting the rate of blood ethanol elimination. Zinc supplementation also prevented ethanol-induced decreases in glutathione concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity and increased glutathione reductase activity in the liver. In conclusion, zinc supplementation prevents alcoholic liver injury in an metallothionein-independent manner by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species (P450 2E1) and enhancing the activity of antioxidant pathways.},

This review addresses the effect of alcohol consumption on the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Although data are limited in humans, studies highlight the importance of changes in the intestinal microbiota in alcohol-related disorders. Alcohol-induced changes in the GIT microbiota composition and metabolic function may contribute to the well-established link between alcohol-induced oxidative stress, intestinal hyperpermeability to luminal bacterial products, and the subsequent development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), as well as other diseases. In addition, clinical and preclinical data suggest that alcohol-related disorders are associated with quantitative and qualitative dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiota and may be associated with increased GIT inflammation, intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and tissue damage/organ pathologies including ALD. Thus, gut-directed interventions, such as probiotic and synbiotic modulation of the intestinal microbiota, should be considered and evaluated for prevention and treatment of alcohol-associated pathologies.},

Antioxidant phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, regulate the expression of ALD-associated proteins and peptides, namely, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. These plant antioxidants have electrophilic activity and may induce antioxidant enzymes via the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-NF-E2-related factor-2 pathway and antioxidant responsive elements. Furthermore, these antioxidants are reported to alleviate cell injury caused by oxidants or inflammatory cytokines. These phenomena are likely induced via the regulation of mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathways by plant antioxidants, similar to preconditioning in ischemia-reperfusion models. Although the relationship between plant antioxidants and ALD has not been adequately investigated, plant antioxidants may be preventive for ALD because of their electrophilic and regulatory activities in the MAPK pathway.},

Three mechanisms have been proposed to cause alcoholic liver injury: (1) acetaldehyde toxicity[18]; (2) metabolic generation of ROS or exposure to oxidative stress[10,19-21]; and (3) provocation of an immune response that causes oxidative stress in hepatocytes[13,22-24].


However, several clinical studies have identified only partial effects of vitamin E in ALD[32,33]. Therefore, the induction of antioxidant enzymes may be more effective than vitamin supplementation in the prevention of ALD.

Although ethanol (EtOH) is known to induce pharmacokinetic tolerance, the

28 rats weighing 341±22g at baseline, 15 were assigned to the EtOH group

4-days of EtOH treatment followed by 10 days of recovery. Rats in both groups
had structural MR imaging (MRI) scans and whole brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) at
baseline, immediately following each binge period, and after each recovery
period (total=11 MR scans per rat)., Average blood alcohol levels (BALs) across each of the 5, 4-day binge
periods were 298, 300, 301, 312, 318 mg/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes of
the lateral ventricles and cisterns showed enlargement with each binge EtOH

metabolites were transient: levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and total
creatine (tCr) decreased, while those of choline-containing compounds (Cho) and
glutamate/glutamine (Glx) increased with each binge EtOH exposure cycle, but
also recovered during each abstinence period. The directionality of changes in

EtOH exposure experiments, but the current results do not provide support for
accruing pathology with repeated binge EtOH exposure.},

Similar BALs were achieved following administration of comparable doses of EtOH over course of experiment (Table 1), indicating an absence of metabolic tolerance (i.e., it was not necessary to increase the dose of EtOH administered to achieve similar BALs) (Cox et al., 2013).


That a few behavioral responses to equivalent BALs diminished over time (i.e., startle response, hunched back), however, presents modest evidence for physiological tolerance (Linsenbardt et al., 2011).


In conclusion, repeated episodes of EtOH intoxication and withdrawal provided little to no support for accruing brain pathology as quantified using in vivo MR imaging and spectroscopy.

Thus, the hypothesis that delivery of the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) via recombinant adenovirus would reduce alcohol-induced liver injury was tested. Rats were given recombinant adenovirus containing Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) and then fed alcohol enterally for 4 weeks. Mn-SOD expression and activity of Ad.SOD2 in liver mitochondria of infected animals was increased nearly 3-fold compared with Ad.lacZ-infected controls. Mitochondrial glutathione levels in Ad.lacZ-infected animals were decreased after 4 weeks of chronic ethanol, as expected, but were unchanged in Ad.SOD2-infected animals. Alanine aminotransferase was elevated significantly by ethanol, an effect that was prevented by Ad.SOD2. Moreover, pathology (e.g. the sum of steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis) was elevated dramatically by ethanol in Ad.lacZ-treated rats. This effect was also blunted in animals infected with Ad.SOD2. Neutrophil infiltration was increased about 3-fold in livers from both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected rats by ethanol treatment. Moreover, ESR-detectable free radical adducts in bile were increased about 8-fold by ethanol. Using13C-labeled ethanol, it was determined that nearly 60\% of total adducts were due to the α-hydroxyethyl radical adduct. This increase in radical formation was blocked completely by Ad.SOD2 infection. Furthermore, apoptosis of hepatocytes was increased about 5-fold by ethanol, an effect also blocked by Ad.SOD2. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA was elevated to the same extent in both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected animals follows ethanol exposure. These data suggest that hepatocyte mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in alcohol-induced liver damage and likely follows Kupffer cell activation, cytokine production, and neutrophil infiltration. These results also support the hypothesis that mitochondrial oxidant production is a critical factor in parenchymal cell death caused by alcohol.},

	abstract = {Background
Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.

Objectives
Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.

Search methods
Search methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years).
We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies.
A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005).
Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.

Main results
Main results

This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies.
When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95\% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95\% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95\% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1\%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95\% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7\%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo.
Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings.
For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.},

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Oral glutamine supplementation was continued for at least 12 days. Patients kept a daily record of diarrhea and stomatitis. The plasma glutamine level, intestinal permeability (lactulose-mannitol test), and tumor size were analyzed. The expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens in breast carcinoma was assessed.
RESULTS: The plasma glutamine level was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the placebo group (420.39 +/- 52.39 mmol/L vs 309.76 +/- 42.34 mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.05). After one cycle of chemotherapy, the lactulose-mannitol ratio was higher in the placebo group than in the glutamine group (0.0630 +/- 0.0091 vs 0.0471 +/- 0.0094, P {\textless} 0.05). No differences were observed in the grades of stomatitis and diarrhea, in the changes in tumor size, and in the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic oral glutamine could ameliorate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced increase in intestinal permeability, but had no significant positive clinical effect on stomatitis and diarrhea and did not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy.},

For this purpose, a total of 17 heavy drinkers [age, 31.6±3.2 years; body mass index (BMI), 27.4±0.8 kg/m(2); experimental group (EG)] and 17 controls [age, 33.5±1.3 years; BMI, 26.1±1.4 kg/m(2); control group (CG), who did not exceed moderate alcohol consumption], underwent one trial of acute exercise of moderate intensity (50-60\% of the heart rate reserve) for 30 min on a cycle ergometer, following an overnight fast, and abstaining from smoking and alcohol consumption. Blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise for later determination of the indices of liver function and blood redox status. The subjects in the EG had significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) baseline γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels compared to the subjects in the CG. Exercise thus resulted in significantly higher γ-GT levels (p{\textless}0.005) only in the EG. No significant differences in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) baseline levels were observed between the 2 groups. Following exercise, the AST levels increased significantly (p{\textless}0.001) in both groups, whereas the ALT levels increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01) only in the EG. The baseline glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly lower (p{\textless}0.05) and remained low following exercise in the EG. In addition, we observed a trend for higher (p=0.07) baseline levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), which remained elevated post-exercise in the EG compared to the CG. Significantly increased post-exercise total antioxidant capacity (TAC; p{\textless}0.01) and uric acid (UA; p{\textless}0.05) levels were noted in the CG, whereas the TAC (p=0.06) and UA (p=0.08) levels increased and approached significance post-exercise in the EG. No significant differences in the baseline levels of total bilirubin and protein carbonyl were observed between the 2 groups, even post-exercise. Thus, the findings of the present study indicate that even though heavy drinkers may be prone to oxidative stress, their exercise-induced antioxidant response is similar to that of individuals who do not drink heavily.},

	abstract = {In spite of the extensive work on the effect of temperature on plants in general, there are very few reviews on this subject as a whole, the most extensive being that of Belehradek (7). The ecological effects of temperature are discussed by Daubenmire (35), Whyte (153), and Walter (139). Tem­ perature, along with light, humidity, etc., belongs to the important factors in the environment of plants. It is also an insufficiently appreciated tool for research, for in many cases the processes of growth can be differentiated by their temperature responses. A good example of this fact is the photo­ synthetic process, in which temperature affects a chemical process at high light intensities and a diffusion process at low light intensities when the photochemical process becomes limiting. The temperatures at which most physiological processes go on normally in plants range from approximately O°C. to 40°C. Very high and very low temperatures cause injury effects, which are a different matter, have already been discussed in previous volumes (64, 75), and need no further elaboration (see also 81). We can distinguish between direct temperature effects on physiological partial processes, which allow us to draw conclusions about the physico-chemical processes involved, and the different effects of temperature on the organism as a whole. There are direct and delayed effects, and effects of fluctuation in temperature. For practical purposes we can subdivide the subject still further to effects of temperature on a) the early stages of growth (germination, vernalization), b) during the plant's maturity, and c) on the dormant stages. Almost half of all published papers in plant physiology could be quoted in this review, for all contain references to temperature, if only to describe experimental conditions. Actually, only the few in which temperature response is treated as a major problem will be discussed; this should give a bird's-eye view of the whole. The effects of temperature on the individual life and growth processes must be known in order to understand the effect of temperature on plants as a whole. Cell growth, especially cell elongation, has a high Q10 which indicates that this is a chemically rather than physically controlled phe­ nomenon (26). The growth of excised plant parts has been studied at different temperatures. The optimal growth temperature for tomato roots was found to be 30°C.

Objectives:to describe the effects of alcohol on the CNS, identifying the signaling pathways that are modified and the biological effects resulting from its consumption.Methods:a literature review was conducted and articles published in different languages over the last 15 years were retrieved.Results:the studies reviewed describe the direct effect of alcohol on several neurotransmitter receptors (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], glutamate, endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG, among others), the indirect effect of alcohol on the limbic and opioid systems, and the effect on calcium and potassium channels and on proteins regulated by GABA in the hippocampus.Discussion and conclusion:the multiple actions of alcohol on the CNS result in a general effect of psychomotor depression, difficulties in information storage and logical reasoning and motor incoordination, in addition to stimulating the reward system, a fact that may explain the development of addiction. Knowledge on the neuronal signaling pathways that are altered by alcohol allows the identification of effectors which could reduce its central action, thus, offering new therapeutic perspectives for the rehabilitation of alcohol addicts.Keywords: alcohol-induced disorders; nervous system; neurotransmitter receptors},

There was a significant increase in the activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in the serum of the ethanol group. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expressions of cytochrome P4502E1 and nuclear factor κB1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β(1) in hepatocytes were significantly increased in ethanol group. The fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin and α(1)(I) collagen and activity of cytotoxicity marker caspase-3 were significantly increased and AA content was significantly reduced in hepatocytes of alcohol-treated guinea pigs. But the AA and silymarin supplementation significantly reduced these changes in comparison with alcohol abstention group. AA could induce greater reduction of inflammatory and fibrotic markers in hepatocytes than silymarin. This indicates that AA is superior to silymarin in inhibiting intracellular ROS generation and thereby reducing the ethanol-induced inflammation in hepatocytes.},

By the latter part of the 19th century, neuronal theories had also been well articulated (Liveing, 1873) and, indeed, Gowers (1888) seemed happy with that concept. It is remarkable that three key approaches revived the vascular theory in the mid- to late-20th century; and the same three key areas—human experimental studies, observations on vascular change and therapeutics—have, some 120 years later, put migraine back into the brain, and thus firmly into the domain of neurology.

This issue of Brain describes a study with exactly the type of result that lead Wolff to think of migraine as vascular; yet, taken in context, it provides evidence that leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.

	abstract = {Hallucinogens (psychedelics) are psychoactive substances that powerfully alter perception, mood, and a host of cognitive processes. They are considered physiologically safe and do not produce dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in a variety of sociocultural and ritual contexts. In the 1950s, after the virtually contemporaneous discovery of both serotonin (5-HT) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), early brain research focused intensely on the possibility that LSD or other hallucinogens had a serotonergic basis of action and reinforced the idea that 5-HT was an important neurotransmitter in brain. These ideas were eventually proven, and today it is believed that hallucinogens stimulate 5-HT2A receptors, especially those expressed on neocortical pyramidal cells. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors also leads to increased cortical glutamate levels presumably by a presynaptic receptor-mediated release from thalamic afferents. These findings have led to comparisons of the effects of classical hallucinogens with certain aspects of acute psychosis and to a focus on thalamocortical interactions as key to understanding both the action of these substances and the neuroanatomical sites involved in altered states of consciousness (ASC). In vivo brain imaging in humans using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose has shown that hallucinogens increase prefrontal cortical metabolism, and correlations have been developed between activity in specific brain areas and psychological elements of the ASC produced by hallucinogens. The 5-HT2A receptor clearly plays an essential role in cognitive processing, including working memory, and ligands for this receptor may be extremely useful tools for future cognitive neuroscience research. In addition, it appears entirely possible that utility may still emerge for the use of hallucinogens in treating alcoholism, substance abuse, and certain psychiatric disorders. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Alcoholic (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) are clinical conditions leading to hepatocellular injury and inflammation resulting from alcohol consumption, high fat diet, obesity and diabetes, among others. Oxidant stress is a major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of ALD and NAFLD. Multiple studies have shown that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is key for the progression of fatty liver to steatohepatitis. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) plays a critical role in ROS generation and CYP2E1 is also induced by alcohol itself. This review summarizes the role of CYP2E1 in ALD and NAFLD.},

MEOS has a higher Km than ADH in oxidizing alcohol and oxidizes alcohol to generate acetaldehyde.


Among the cytochrome P450 family, CYP2E1 has been identified as the most relevant for ALD as it is highly inducible and it has high catalytic activity for alcohol [18].


CYP2E1 is mainly expressed in the liver, with hepatocytes showing the highest expression, but it is also located in other organs such as the brain and intestine. CYP2E1 is mainly located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) although it is also expressed in the mitochondria [23].


Previous studies showed that increased cellular injury, lipid peroxidation, oxidant and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial damage occurred in livers from chronic ethanol-fed mice compared with pair-fed mice. One of the reasons for the increase in CYP2E1 protein during chronic ethanol intake is decreased proteasomal degradation, which increases CYP2E1 protein stability [[12], [27]].

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
To assess how alcohol affects multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) and subjective measures of stimulation/sedation when alcohol is given at different circadian phases.

Participants:
Twenty-seven healthy young adults (age 21-26 yr) were studied.

Design:
Double-blind placebo and alcohol (vodka tonic targeting 0.05 g\% concentration) beverages were each administered three times during the 20-h forced desynchrony protocol. Sleep latency tests and Biphasic Effects of Alcohol Scale (BAES) were administered on each forced desynchrony day. The outcome variables for this study include sleep onset latency (SOL) and stimulation and sedation value (from the BAES). Each outcome variable was associated with the ascending or descending limb of the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) curve and assigned a circadian phase within a 90° bin.

Measurements and Results:
BrAC confirmed targeted maximal levels. Only outcome variables associated with the ascending and descending limb of the alcohol curve were analyzed for this article. Alcohol administered at a circadian time associated with greatest sleepiness showed longer SOL compared with placebo when measured on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve. We also found longer SOL with alcohol on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve in a circadian bin that favors greatest alertness. We observed shorter SOLs on the descending limb of the BrAC curve, but with no circadian phase interaction. The subjective data were partially consistent with the objective data.

Conclusions:
The physiologic findings in this study support the biphasic stimulating and sedating properties of alcohol, but limit the effect to specific circadian times.

The glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine failed to affect the l-glutamine-mediated protection of barrier function. l-Glutamine reduced the acetaldehyde-induced redistribution of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the intercellular junctions. Acetaldehyde dissociates occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the actin cytoskeleton, and this effect was reduced by l-glutamine. l-Glutamine induced a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor, and the protective effect of l-glutamine was prevented by AG1478, the EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These results indicate that l-glutamine prevents acetaldehyde-induced disruption of the tight junction and increase in the paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayer by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism.},

	abstract = {Silica aerogel granulate is a nanostructured material with high solar transmittance and low thermal conductivity. These properties offer exciting applications in building envelopes. One objective of the joint R\&D project ISOTEG at ZAE Bayern was to develop and characterize a new glazing element based on granular silica aerogel. Heat transfer coefficients of less than 0.4 W/(m2 K) and a total solar energy transmittance of 35\% for the whole glazing unit were achieved. The glazing has a thickness of less than 50 mm. Another application for granular silica aerogel is, for example, in solar collectors. The thermal properties of the glazing as well as the optical and thermal properties of the granular aerogels are presented here. The solar transmittance of a 10 mm packed bed of silica aerogel was 53\% for semi-translucent spheres and 88\% for highly translucent granulate. In our heat transfer experiments the gas pressure, external pressure load, temperature and gas filling were varied. The various thermal conductivity values measured for the glazing and collector applications were compared to the values calculated using two different packed bed models. For the gas-dependent measurements the intergranular voids in the granulate were 1.0 ± 0.1 mm before loading the packed bed, 0.3 ± 0.1 mm at an external load of 3.2 bar (3.2 × 105 Pa) and 0.6 ± 0.1 mm after release. A direct radiative conduction of λdirect = 4.5 ± 0.5 × 10 -3 W m-1 K-1 was obtained. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Alcohol promotes the generation of ROS and/or interferes with the body's normal defense mechanisms against these compounds through numerous processes, particularly in the liver. For example, alcohol breakdown in the liver results in the formation of molecules whose further metabolism in the cell leads to ROS production. Alcohol also stimulates the activity of enzymes called cytochrome P450s, which contribute to ROS production. Further, alcohol can alter the levels of certain metals in the body, thereby facilitating ROS production. Finally, alcohol reduces the levels of agents that can eliminate ROS (i.e., antioxidants). The resulting state of the cell, known as oxidative stress, can lead to cell injury. ROS production and oxidative stress in liver cells play a central role in the development of alcoholic liver disease.},

Firstly, an experiment was conducted to test thermal performance of the new collector on July 9, 2011. After a daily work from 09:00 to 16:00, the maximum collector efficiency could reach 66\%, while the temperature of water of 200. kg in the storage tank increased by about 25.0. °C in the end. Secondly, a theoretical analysis on the energy balance for each component of the collector was made to understand the heat transfer process inside the collector. Thirdly, a transient heat transfer model has been developed to calculate the collector efficiency, temperatures of water, the glass cover and the absorber plate, of which the simulation results are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Taurine, glutamine and arginine are examples of amino acids which have become increasingly popular as ingredients in dietary supplements and functional foods and beverages. Animal and human clinical research suggests that oral supplementation of these amino acids provides additional health and/or performance benefits beyond those observed from normal intake of dietary protein. The increased consumer awareness and use of these amino acids as ingredients in dietary supplements and functional foods warrant a comprehensive review of their safety through quantitative risk assessment, and identification of a potential safe upper level of intake. The absence of a systematic pattern of adverse effects in humans in response to orally administered taurine (Tau), l-glutamine (Gln) and l-arginine (Arg) precluded the selection of a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). Therefore, by definition, the usual approach to risk assessment for identification of a tolerable upper level of intake (UL) could not be used. Instead, the newer method described as the Observed Safe Level (OSL) or Highest Observed Intake (HOI) was utilized. The OSL risk assessments indicate that based on the available published human clinical trial data, the evidence for the absence of adverse effects is strong for Tau at supplemental intakes up to 3 g/d, Gln at intakes up to 14 g/d and Arg at intakes up to 20 g/d, and these levels are identified as the respective OSLs for normal healthy adults. Although much higher levels of each of these amino acids have been tested without adverse effects and may be safe, the data for intakes above these levels are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety, and therefore these values are not selected as the OSLs.},

	abstract = {Molten-salt thermocline tanks are a low-cost energy storage option for concentrating solar power plants. Despite the potential economic advantage, the capacity of thermocline tanks to store sufficient amounts of high-temperature heat is limited by the low energy density of the constituent sensible-heat storage media. A promising design modification replaces conventional rock filler inside the tank with an encapsulated phase-change material (PCM), contributing a latent heat storage mechanism to increase the overall energy density. The current study presents a new finite-volume approach to simulate mass and energy transport inside a latent heat thermocline tank at low computational cost. This storage model is then integrated into a system-level model of a molten-salt power tower plant to inform tank operation with respect to realistic solar collection and power production. With this system model, PCMs with different melting temperatures and heats of fusion are evaluated for their viability in latent heat storage for solar plants.Thermocline tanks filled with a single PCM do not yield a substantial increase in annual storage or plant output over a conventional rock-filled tank of equal size. As the melting temperature and heat of fusion are increased, the ability of the PCM to support steam generation improves but the corresponding ability of the thermocline tank to utilize this available latent heat decreases. This trend results from an inherent deconstruction of the heat-exchange region inside the tank between sensible and latent heat transfer, preventing effective use of the added phase change for daily plant operations. This problem can be circumvented with a cascaded filler structure composed of multiple PCMs with their melting temperatures tuned along the tank height. However, storage benefits with these cascaded tank structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the proper selection of the PCM melting points relative to the thermocline tank operating temperatures. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: l-Glutamate (Glu) is a major amino acid in milk and postweaning diets for mammals (including pigs and human infants). However, effects of Glu on intestinal mucosal barrier and antioxidative functions are unknown.
Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that Glu may enhance the barrier function of intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1) cells by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins.
Methods: IPEC-1 cells were cultured with or without Glu in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L diquat (an oxidant) for indicated time points. Cell numbers, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), mRNA, and protein abundance of glutamate transporter, the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the abundance of tight junction proteins were determined.
Results: Compared with 0 mmol/L Glu, 0.5-, 1-, and 2 mmol/L Glu stimulated (P {\textless} 0.05) cell growth by 13–37\% at 24 h and 12–34\% at 48 h, respectively. In addition, 0.5 mmol/L Glu increased (P {\textless} 0.05) TEER (by 58\% at 24 h and by 98\% at 48 h, respectively). These effects of Glu were associated with increased mRNA abundance of Glu transporter solute carrier family 1 member 1 (SLC1A1) by 30–130\% and protein abundance of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (encoded by SLC1A1) by 19–34\%, respectively. In a cell model of oxidative stress induced by 1 mmol/L diquat, 0.5 mmol/L Glu enhanced cell viability, TEER, and membrane integrity (as indicated by the reduced release of LDH) in IPEC-1 cells by increasing the abundance of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-3, zonula occludens (ZO)-2, and ZO-3.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that Glu plays an important role in mucosal barrier function by enhancing cell growth and maintaining membrane integrity in response to oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Glutamine (GLN) is the most abundant free amino acid (AA) in the human body. Under GLN-free conditions, which can be obtained when cells are cultivated in vitro, tissue cells cannot grow. Therefore, when classifying GLN as a "non-essential" AA, one must consider that in the human body GLN is synthesized from essential AAs and is continuously delivered from skeletal muscle to other organs. It is fascinating that a relatively simple AA like GLN can stimulate a large variety of cellular reactions. GLN stimulates not only the growth of cells but also the expression of surface antigens, the formation of cytokines, and the synthesis of heat shock proteins. Further, a GLN deficiency leads to a cell cycle arrest in G(0) to G(1) and reduces apoptosis. Interestingly, many of these biological activities also are associated with the cellular reduced oxygen potential, which depends mainly on the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione. Experimental animal studies have shown that the administration of GLN increases tissue concentrations of reduced glutathione. This review describes the relation of GLN to reduced glutathione metabolism and discusses the alteration of reduced glutathione metabolism under a variety of clinical conditions such as reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, respiratory insufficiency, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, and clinical protein catabolism.},

No psychometrically established measure of acute hangover symptoms is published and available to use in experimental investigations. The present investigation combined data across three studies of residual alcohol effects to establish the properties of a new Acute Hangover Scale (AHS) based on symptoms supported in previous lab studies.

Methods
Professional mariners from a Swedish maritime academy (n = 54) and young adult students/recent graduates of urban U.S. universities (n = 135) participated in one of three within-subjects' studies of residual effects of heavy drinking (M = .114 g\% breath alcohol concentration [BrAC]). All drank placebo one evening and alcoholic drinks another evening followed by an 8-hour sleep period before completing the AHS 10-20 min after awakening.

Results
The AHS showed excellent internal consistency reliability the morning after alcohol. The AHS mean score and each item were significantly affected by beverage but not demographics or typical drinking, supporting validity.

Conclusions
The AHS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing acute hangover symptoms in experimental investigations of residual alcohol effects.},

Rats irradiated with 10 Gy to the abdomen were randomly divided into a glutamine-free diet group and a glutamine-rich diet (2\% glutamine) group. After 3 days of feeding of each diet, the 6-h urinary recovery of polyethylene glycol 4000 was significantly decreased in the glutamine-rich diet group compared to that in the glutamine-free diet group. The 6-h urinary recovery of phenolsulfonphthalein was also decreased in the glutamine-rich diet group, but the difference was not significant. Plasma endotoxin concentration was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group. Twenty-four hour after gavage with 14C-labeled Escherichia coli, the detection rate of 14C-labeled bacteria in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group. The adherence of 14C-labeled E. coli in the jejunal mucosa was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group than in the glutamine-free diet group, but there were no significant differences in the ileal mucosa. These findings suggest that in rats with intestinal injury induced by irradiation, enteral glutamine maintains the intestinal barrier and reduces bacterial translocation.},

This study has investigated the antioxidant effects of Tannat red wine on oxidative stress induced by glucose and fructose in erythrocytes in vitro, with the purpose to determine some of its majoritarian phenolic compounds and its antioxidant capacity. Erythrocytes were incubated using different concentrations of glucose and fructose in the presence or absence of wine. From these erythrocytes were determined the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), glucose consumption, and osmotic fragility. Moreover, quantification of total phenolic, gallic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, resveratrol, and DPPH scavenging activity in wine were also assessed. Red wine showed high levels of polyphenols analyzed, as well as high antioxidant potential. Erythrocytes incubated with glucose and fructose had an increase in lipid peroxidation and this was prevented by the addition of wine. The wine increased glucose uptake into erythrocytes and was able to decrease the osmotic fragility of erythrocytes incubated with fructose. Altogether, these results suggest that wine leads to a reduction of the oxidative stress induced by high concentrations of glucose and fructose.},

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease explained by extracellular amyloid beta deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increasing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction displays significant role in the pathophysiological processes of AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction involves alterations in mitochondrial respiratory enzyme complex activities, oxidative stress, opening of permeability transition pore and enhanced apoptosis. Various bioenergetics and antioxidants have been tried or under different investigational phase against AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) because of their complex and multiple site of action. These mitochondrial-targeting bioenergetics and antioxidant compounds such as coenzyme Q10, idebenone, creatine, mitoQ, mitovitE, mitotempol, latrepirdine, methylene blue, triterpenoids, SS peptides, curcumin, Ginkgo biloba and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with potential efficacy in AD have been identified.

To investigate the elimination kinetics of psilocin (PI), the first metabolite of PY, urine was collected for 24 h and PI concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with column switching and electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Sample workup included protection of the unstable PI with ascorbic acid, freeze-drying, and extraction with methanol. Peak PI concentrations up to 870 ??g/l were measured in urine samples from the 2-4 h collection interval. The PI excretion rate in this period was 55.5??33.8 ??g/h. The limit of quantitation (10 ??g/L) was usually reached 24 h after drug administration. Within 24 h, 3.4??0.9\% of the applied dose of PY was excreted as free PI. Addition of ??-glucuronidase to urine samples and incubation for 5 h at 40??C led to twofold higher PI concentrations, although 18??7\% of the amount of unconjugated PI was decomposed during incubation. We conclude that in humans PI is partially excreted as PI-O-glucuronide and that enzymatic hydrolysis extends the time of detectability for PI in urine samples. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Chronic alcoholism is a major public health problem and causes multiorgan diseases and toxicity. Although the majority of ethanol ingested is metabolized by the liver, it has intoxicating effects in the brain. Evidence is accumulating that intermediates of oxygen reduction may be associated with the development of alcoholic disease. Several studies have shown the capacity of carnitine and its derivatives to influence ethanol metabolism. We have previously demonstrated that preadministration of L-carnitine to rats receiving ethanol significantly reduced fatty acid ethyl esters in different organs and that the carnitine/acylcarnitine system is crucial for maintaining a functional acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio under conditions in which cellular homeostasis is exposed to the deleterious effects of accumulating organic acids. Ethanol, administered to rats for 20 months, induced significant changes in the status of glutathione, primarily in the brain regions of hippocampus and cerebellum, followed by cortex and striatum, where a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio was found. The same brain regions showed a significant increase in free radical-induced luminescence and hydroxynonenal (HNE), which were associated with decreased GSH reductase activity. Long-term supplementation with acetyl carnitine significantly reduced GSH depletion, particularly in the brain regions of hippocampus, an effect associated with decreased luminescence and HNE formation. In addition, acetyl carnitine treatment increased GSH reductase and arginase activities. Our results indicate that decreased GSH reductase activities associated with thiol depletion are important factors sustaining a pathogenic role in alcohol-related pathologies. Administration of acetyl carnitine greatly reduces these metabolic abnormalities. This evidence supports the pharmacological potential of acetyl carnitine in the management of alcoholic disturbances.},

The gastric cytoprotective properties of natural honey (monofloral and polyfloral specimens) and of a glucose-fructose-sucrose-maltose mixture (gfsm) was evaluated in the rat using absolute ethanol, indomethacin and acidified acetylsalicylic acid (asa-hcl) as necrotising agents. Prior gastric administration of honey (2.5 g/kg) to animals induced a net reduction of hemorrhagic lesions length of the mucosa. Protection of the stomach elicited by both types of honey and gfsm was almost total against ethanol-induced lesions. Similar results were also observed when using asa-hcl except that the percent protection was 87\%. The percent reduction of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was variable according to the nature of the test solution: gfsm mixture (41.1\%) \&lt; polyfloral honey (55.2\%) \&lt; monofloral honey (64.0\%). Perfusion of the stomach with isotonic honey resulted in (1) a 70\% reduction of the area of the lesions caused by ethanol, (2) the failure to prevent the transmural potential difference fall induced by ethanol, (3) an increase of basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion. These results suggest that sugar rich solutions (gfsm and honey) may prevent gastric damage by a mechanism involving the release of some protective agents.},

	abstract = {Agmatine is a neuromodulator that regulates multiple neurotransmitters and signaling pathways. Several studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of this molecule, which seems to be mediated by a reduction in oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and proapoptotic signaling. Since these events are implicated in acute and chronic excitotoxicity-related disorders (ischemia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) as well as in nociception, agmatine has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Agmatine also stimulates the expression of trophic factors and adult neurogenesis, contributing to its ability to induce endogenous repair mechanisms. Therefore, considering its wide range of biological effects, this review summarizes the current knowledge about its protective and regenerative properties in the CNS.},

	abstract = {Relapse and neurodegeneration are two of the major therapeutic targets in alcoholism. Fortuitously, the roles of glutamate/NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in withdrawal, conditioning and neurotoxicity mean that NMDAR inhibitors are potentially valuable for both targets. Preclinical studies further suggest that inhibitory modulators that specifically reduce the co-agonist effects of polyamines on NMDARs are potential non-toxic medications. Using agmatine as a lead compound, over 1000 novel compounds based loosely on this structure were synthesized using feedback from a molecular screen. A novel series of aryliminoguanidines with appropriate NMDAR activity in the molecular screen were discovered (US patent application filed 2007). The most potent and selective aryliminoguanidine, JR 220 [4- (chlorobenzylidenamino)- guanidine hydrochloride], has now been tested in a screening hierarchy for anti-relapse and neuroprotective activity, ranging from cell-based assay, through tissue culture to animal behavior. This hierarchy has been validated using drugs with known, or potential, clinical value at these targets (acamprosate (N-acetyl homotaurine), memantine and topiramate). JR220 was non-toxic and showed excellent activity in every screen with a potency 5-200x that of the FDA-approved anti-relapse agent, acamprosate. This chapter will present a review of the background and rationale for this approach and some of the findings garnered from this approach as well as patents targeting the glutamatergic system especially the NMDAR.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the cooling rate of hyperthermic subjects, as measured by three estimates of deep core temperatures (esophageal, rectal and aural canal temperatures), during immersion in a range of water temperatures. The objective of the study was to compare the three indices of core temperature and define safe cooling limits when using rectal temperature to avoid the development of hypothermia. On 4 separate days, seven subjects (four males, three females) exercised for 45.4+/-4.1 min at 65\% V(O2)max at an ambient temperature of 39 degrees C, RH: 36.5\%, until rectal temperature (T (re)) increased to 40.0 degrees C (39.5 degrees C for two subjects). Following exercise, the subjects were immersed in a circulated water bath controlled at 2, 8, 14 and 20 degrees C until T (re) returned to 37.5 degrees C. When T (re) reached normothermia during the cooling period (37.5+/-0.05 degrees C), both esophageal (T (es)) (35.6+/-1.3 degrees C) and aural canal (T (ac)) (35.9+/-0.9 degrees C) temperatures were approaching or reaching hypothermia, particularly during immersion in 2 degrees C water (T (es)=34.5+/-1.2 degrees C). On the basis of the heat loss data, the heat gained during the exercise was fully eliminated after 5.4+/-1.5, 7.9+/-2.9, 10.4+/-3.8 and 13.1+/-2.8 min of immersion in 2, 8, 14 and 20 degrees C water, respectively, with the coldest water showing a significantly faster cooling rate. During the immersion in 2 degrees C water, a decrease of only 1.5 degrees C in T (re) resulted in the elimination of 100\% of the heat gained during exercise without causing hypothermia. This study would therefore support cooling the core temperature of hyperthermic subjects to a rectal temperature between 37.8 degrees C (during immersion in water {\textbackslash}textgreater10 degrees C) and 38.6 degrees C (during immersion in water {\textbackslash}textless10 degrees C) to eliminate the heat gained during exercise without causing hypothermia.},

	abstract = {Many natural products exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing excessive nitric oxide (NO) production by inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol has been formerly shown to decrease nitrite generation, taken as an index for NO, but so far it was not clear which constituent of the complex flavonoid mixture mediated this effect. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the in vivo generated Pycnogenol metabolite M1 (δ-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone) displayed any activity in the context of induction of iNOS expression and excessive NO production. For the first time we show that M1 inhibited nitrite production (IC(50) 1.3 μg/ml, 95\% CI 0.96-1.70) and iNOS expression (IC(50) 3.8 μg/ml, 95\% CI 0.99-14.35) in a concentration-dependent fashion. This exemplifies bioactivation by metabolism because the M1 precursor molecule catechin is only weakly active. However, these effects required application of M1 in the low-micromolar range, which was not consistent with concentrations previously detected in human plasma samples after ingestion of maritime pine bark extract. Thus, we investigated a possible accumulation of M1 in cells and indeed observed high-capacity binding of this flavonoid metabolite to macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. This binding was distinctly decreased in the presence of the influx inhibitor phloretin, suggesting the contribution of a facilitated M1 transport into cells. In fact, intracellular accumulation of M1 could explain why in vivo bioactivity can be observed with nanomolar plasma concentrations that typically fail to exhibit measurable activity in vitro.},

	title = {Involvement of accumbal glycine receptors in the regulation of voluntary ethanol intake in the rat},
	volume = {29},
	issn = {0145-6008},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) increase after ethanol (EtOH) administration in the rat, a response that may be involved in the positive reinforcing effects of EtOH. The mechanisms underlying this DA activation and how they relate to EtOH reinforcement remain to be elucidated, but recent data indicate that glycine receptors (GlyRs) in the nAc may be involved. Here this hypothesis was further challenged by examining the influence of bilateral accumbal application of glycine (a GlyR agonist), strychnine (a GlyR competitive antagonist), or Ringer on EtOH intake and preference, as well as on the concomitant DA output in the nAc, in EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats.
METHODS: EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats [EtOH preference {\textgreater}60\% during continuous access to a bottle of EtOH (6\% v/v) and a bottle of water] were limited to drink 1 hr/day (limited access drinking). Thereafter, the animals were equipped bilaterally with microdialysis probes aimed at the mAc, and were subjected to in vivo microdialysis (coupled to high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) and reversed microdialysis (for drug application) during two experimental days (balanced study), during which the animals were allowed a choice between EtOH and water.
RESULTS: The EtOH consumption in rats that were perfused with Ringer in the nAc was approximately 0.9 g/kg/hr and associated with a significant increase in extracellular accumbal DA levels. In a subpopulation of rats, bilateral accumbal glycine (100 microM) perfusion produced a significant increase in accumbal DA output and a decrease in EtOH preference and intake. In these glycine responders, the EtOH consumed (approximately 0.7 g/kg/hr) did not produce a further increase of DA levels. In other rats, bilateral glycine perfusion did not change the accumbal DA output, and voluntary EtOH intake was not altered. In these glycine nonresponders, EtOH tended to increase accumbal DA levels. Bilateral accumbal strychnine (20 microM) perfusion significantly decreased DA output in the nAc, and the DA levels remained decreased despite a statistically significant increase of EtOH intake. Finally, the increase in accumbal DA levels observed after EtOH consumption in Ringer-treated rats was significantly larger in glycine responders than in glycine nonresponders.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that glycine and strychnine alter extracellular DA levels in the nAc, probably via GlyR stimulation and blockade, respectively, and concomitantly glycine and strychnine reciprocally alter also EtOH consumption in EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats. The possibility of developing selective GlyR agonists and/or antagonists should be explored. Such agents could prove of value in the treatment of alcoholism.},

	abstract = {A full understanding of consciousness requires that we identify the brain processes from which conscious experiences emerge. What are these processes, and what is their utility in supporting successful adaptive behaviors? Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) predicted a functional link between processes of Consciousness, Learning, Expectation, Attention, Resonance and Synchrony (CLEARS), including the prediction that "all conscious states are resonant states". This connection clarifies how brain dynamics enable a behaving individual to autonomously adapt in real time to a rapidly changing world. The present article reviews theoretical considerations that predicted these functional links, how they work, and some of the rapidly growing body of behavioral and brain data that have provided support for these predictions. The article also summarizes ART models that predict functional roles for identified cells in laminar thalamocortical circuits, including the six layered neocortical circuits and their interactions with specific primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific nuclei. These predictions include explanations of how slow perceptual learning can occur without conscious awareness, and why oscillation frequencies in the lower layers of neocortex are sometimes slower beta oscillations, rather than the higher-frequency gamma oscillations that occur more frequently in superficial cortical layers. ART traces these properties to the existence of intracortical feedback loops, and to reset mechanisms whereby thalamocortical mismatches use circuits such as the one from specific thalamic nuclei to nonspecific thalamic nuclei and then to layer 4 of neocortical areas via layers 1-to-5-to-6-to-4. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	doi = {10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01249.x},
	abstract = {Background
Emerging evidence suggests that taurine acts as a partial agonist at glycine receptors (GlyR) in vitro and in vivo. Ethanol acts as an allosteric modulator at the GlyR producing a leftward shift of the glycine concentration-response curve, with no enhancing effects observed at saturating glycine concentrations. However, to date no electrophysiological studies have been performed on ethanol modulation of taurine-activated GlyR.

Methods
Wildtype α1 GlyR, or those bearing a serine-267 to isoleucine replacement (S267I), were homomerically expressed in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamped at 70 mV. Ethanol was co-applied with varying concentrations of glycine or taurine and the enhancing effects of ethanol compared.

Results
Ethanol potentiated glycine- and taurine-activated GlyR responses in a concentration-dependent manner. It shifted taurine and glycine concentration-response curves to the left, having no effects at saturating agonist concentrations. Chelation of zinc by tricine decreased ethanol enhancement of taurine-gated GlyR function. The S267I mutation prevented ethanol enhancement of taurine-mediated responses as previously also reported for glycine.

Conclusion
Ethanol modulates taurine activation of GlyR function by a mechanism similar to that of the full agonist glycine. The lack of effect of ethanol at saturating taurine concentrations provides mechanistic information on alcohol actions at the GlyR.},

	abstract = {Glutamine synthetase (GS) in brain is located mainly in astrocytes. One of the primary roles of astrocytes is to protect neurons against excitotoxicity by taking up excess ammonia and glutamate and converting it into glutamine via the enzyme GS. Changes in GS expression may reflect changes in astroglial function, which can affect neuronal functions.
Hyperammonemia is an important factor responsible of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and causes astroglial swelling. Hyperammonemia can be experimentally induced and an adaptive astroglial response to high levels of ammonia and glutamate seems to occur in long-term studies. In hyperammonemic states, astroglial cells can experience morphological changes that may alter different astrocyte functions, such as protein synthesis or neurotransmitters uptake. One of the observed changes is the increase in the GS expression in astrocytes located in glutamatergic areas. The induction of GS expression in these specific areas would balance the increased ammonia and glutamate uptake and protect against neuronal degeneration, whereas, decrease of GS expression in non-glutamatergic areas could disrupt the neuron-glial metabolic interactions as a consequence of hyperammonemia.
Induction of GS has been described in astrocytes in response to the action of glutamate on active glutamate receptors. The over-stimulation of glutamate receptors may also favour nitric oxide (NO) formation by activation of NO synthase (NOS), and NO has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several CNS diseases. Hyperammonemia could induce the formation of inducible NOS in astroglial cells, with the consequent NO formation, deactivation of GS and dawn-regulation of glutamate uptake. However, in glutamatergic areas, the distribution of both glial glutamate receptors and glial glutamate transporters parallels the GS location, suggesting a functional coupling between glutamate uptake and degradation by glutamate transporters and GS to attenuate brain injury in these areas.
In hyperammonemia, the astroglial cells located in proximity to blood-vessels in glutamatergic areas show increased GS protein content in their perivascular processes. Since ammonia freely crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and astrocytes are responsible for maintaining the BBB, the presence of GS in the perivascular processes could produce a rapid glutamine synthesis to be released into blood. It could, therefore, prevent the entry of high amounts of ammonia from circulation to attenuate neurotoxicity. The changes in the distribution of this critical enzyme suggests that the glutamate–glutamine cycle may be differentially impaired in hyperammonemic states.},

However, a subset of alcoholics without any of these predisposing factors can develop alcohol-mediated organ injury. The gastrointestinal tract (GI) could be an important source of inflammation in alcohol-mediated organ damage. The purpose of review was to evaluate mechanisms of alcohol-induced endotoxemia (including dysbiosis and gut leakiness), and highlight the predisposing factors for alcohol-induced dysbiosis and gut leakiness to endotoxins. Barriers, including immunologic, physical, and biochemical can regulate the passage of toxins into the portal and systemic circulation. In addition, a host of environmental interactions including those influenced by circadian rhythms can impact alcohol-induced organ pathology. There appears to be a role for therapeutic measures to mitigate alcohol-induced organ damage by normalizing intestinal dysbiosis and/or improving intestinal barrier integrity. Ultimately, the inflammatory process that drives progression into organ damage from alcohol appears to be multifactorial. Understanding the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease can pose further avenues for pathogenic and treatment approaches.},

As for nitrite, the respective levels were found in white cauliflower (3.49 mg/kg) and green cauliflower (1.47 mg/kg). Both blanching and boiling of the cruciferous vegetables caused a considerable decrease in the total nitrate content, but at the same time no explicit changes were noted regarding the level of nitrite. In the vegetables stored frozen for 48 h, previously blanched, either an increase or no change was observed in the nitrate level, with the changes in the nitrite level being irregular. In the vegetables stored frozen for 4 months, previously blanched, generally a decrease was noted in the nitrate, and an increase in the nitrite level compared to the levels in the blanched vegetables. Boiling of the frozen vegetables (stored frozen for 48 h) most frequently caused a considerable reduction of the nitrate level in comparison to the content in the raw frozen vegetables. No changes were observed resulting from the boiling of the vegetables previously stored frozen for 4 months. Simultaneously, no explicit changes were found regarding the nitrite level in the frozen vegetable after boiling. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Measures of hangover are associated with current and future problematic alcohol use. At present, it is not known whether these associations reflect any direct influence of hangover events on near-term drinking behaviors. The current study aimed to determine whether hangover following a drinking episode influences time to next drink (TTND), and, if so, to determine the direction of this effect and identify any moderating personal or contextual factors.

METHODS
Community-recruited, frequent drinkers oversampled for current smoking (N=386) carried electronic diaries for 21 days, reporting on drinking behaviors and other experiences. Survival analysis was used to model data from 2,276 drinking episodes, including 463 episodes that were followed by self-reported hangover in morning diary entries.

RESULTS
When tested as the sole predictor in a survival model, hangover was associated with increased TTND. The median survival time was approximately 6 hours longer after episodes with hangovers compared to those without. In a multivariate model, hangover was only significant in the presence of interaction effects involving craving at the end of the index drinking episode and the occurrence of financial stressors. Additional predictors of TTND in the final multivariate model included age, lifetime alcohol use disorder diagnosis, typical drinking frequency, day of the week, and morning reports of craving, negative affect, and stressors after the index episode. There was no association between morning reports of hangover and contemporaneous diary ratings of likelihood of drinking later the same day.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that hangover has, at best, a modest or inconsistent influence on the timing of subsequent alcohol use among frequent drinkers.},

In this study, a ground-source heat pump-phase change material (GSHP-PCM) latent heat storage system was developed to use natural energy, to the extent possible, for thermal environment control of the greenhouse. The coefficient of performance of the heat pump (COPHP), that of the overall system (COPsys) and the energy capacity of the PCM during the charge-discharge phases has been determined. Based upon the measurements made in the heating mode from 1 September 2005 till 30 April 2006 in Elazi\{dotless\}??, Turkey, the average heating COPHP of the GSHP unit and the overall system COPsys were obtained to be in the range of 2.3-3.8 and 2-3.5, respectively. These results showed that the utilization of a GSHP-PCM system is a suitable approach for greenhouse heating in this district. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic growth factor and immune modulator. GM-CSF also has profound effects on the functional activities of various circulating leukocytes. It is produced by a variety of cell types including T cells, macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts upon receiving immune stimuli. Although GM-CSF is produced locally, it can act in a paracrine fashion to recruit circulating neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes to enhance their functions in host defense. Recent intensive investigations are centered on the application of GM-CSF as an immune adjuvant for its ability to increase dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function as well as macrophage activity. It is used clinically to treat neutropenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, in AIDS patients during therapy, and in patients after bone marrow transplantation. Interestingly, the hematopoietic system of GM-CSF-deficient mice appears to be normal; the most significant changes are in some specific T cell responses. Although molecular cloning of GM-CSF was carried out using cDNA library of T cells and it is well known that the T cells produce GM-CSF after activation, there is a lack of systematic investigation of this cytokine in production by T cells and its effect on T cell function. In this article, we will focus mainly on the immunobiology of GM-CSF in T cells.},

The gel obtained was washed with deionized water to get rid of im-purities, dried and calcined at 800°C for 3 hours. The obtained silica powders were characterized using atomic absorp-tion spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the vibrational modes and diffraction patterns of the silica derived from com-mercial Na2SiO3 and that prepared from clay were similar containing pure amorphous SiO2. The morphology of the commercially obtained silica showed better arrangement of particles and exhibited slightly lesser porosity (62.4\%) compared to that derived from clay which had a porosity of 65.5\%. The result indicates that clay has a potential for use as an environmentally safe and economic starting material for preparing porous silica instead of high quality precursors.},

In the presence of organic material, death rates of S. aureus compared with L. monocytogenes and E. coli compared with S. typhimurium in ozonated water were not significantly (P {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.05) affected by SS addition but were significantly reduced (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) by addition of 20 ppm of bovine serum albumin (BSA). More than 4.5 log units each of Candida albicans and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water, whereas less than 1 log unit of Aspergillus niger spores was killed after a 5-min exposure. The average ozone output levels in the deionized water (0.188 mg/ml) or water with SS (0.198 mg/ml) did not differ significantly (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) but were significantly lower in water containing BSA (0.149 mg/ml).},

Present study investigated the role of agmatine and imidazoline receptors in antidepressant like effect of SSRIs and imipramine in mouse forced swimming test (FST) paradigm. The antidepressant like effect of fluoxetine or paroxetine was potentiated by imidazoline I(1)/I(2) receptor agonist agmatine (5-10 mg/kg, ip), imidazoline I(1) receptor agonists, moxonidine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, ip) and clonidine (0.015-0.03 mg/kg, ip), imidazoline I(2) receptor agonist, 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (5-10 mg/kg, ip) as well as by the drugs known to increase endogenous agmatine levels in brain viz., L-arginine, an agmatine biosynthetic precursor (40 microg/mouse, icv), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethyl ornithine (12.5 microg/mouse, icv), diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (6.5 microg/mouse, icv) and agmatinase inhibitor, arcaine (50 microg/mouse, icv). Conversely, prior administration of I(1) receptor antagonist, efaroxan (1 mg/kg, ip), I(2) receptor antagonist, idazoxan (0.25 mg/kg, ip) and arginine decarboxylase inhibitor, d-arginine (100 mg/kg, ip) blocked the antidepressant like effect of paroxetine (10 mg/kg, ip) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, ip). On the other hand, antidepressant like effect of imipramine was neither augmented nor attenuated by any of the above drugs. Mice pretreated with SSRIs but not imipramine and exposed to FST showed higher concentration of agmatine in brain as compared to saline control. This effect of SSRIs on agmatine levels was completely blocked by arginine decarboxylase inhibitor d-arginine but not by imidazoline receptor antagonists, efaroxan or idazoxan. These results demonstrate that modulation of imidazoline receptors by agmatine are implicated in the antidepressant like effect of SSRIs and may be projected as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.},

Alcohol exposure can promote the growth of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine which may result in accumulation of endotoxin. In addition, alcohol metabolism by Gram negative bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells can result in accumulation of acetaldehyde, which in turn can increase intestinal permeability to endotoxin by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. Alcohol-induced generation of nitric oxide may also contribute to increased permeability to endotoxin by reacting with tubulin, which may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequent disruption of intestinal barrier function. Increased intestinal permeability can lead to increased transfer of endotoxin from the intestine to the liver and general circulation where endotoxin may trigger inflammatory changes in the liver and other organs. Alcohol may also increase intestinal permeability to peptidoglycan which can initiate inflammatory response in liver and other organs. In addition, acute alcohol exposure may potentiate the effect of burn injury on intestinal bacterial growth and permeability. Decreasing the number of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine can result in decreased production of endotoxin as well as acetaldehyde which is expected to decrease intestinal permeability to endotoxin. In addition, intestinal permeability may be preserved by administering epidermal growth factor, L-glutamine, oats supplementation, or zinc thereby preventing the transfer of endotoxin to the general circulation. Thus reducing the number of intestinal Gram negative bacteria and preserving intestinal permeability to endotoxin may attenuate alcoholic liver and other organ injuries.},

a loss of epithelium at the tips of the villi, haemorrhagic erosions and even haemorrhage in the lamina propria (Bode et al., 2001). Similar lesions were observed in volunteers 2-3 hours after ingestion of alcohol (15-20\%, v/v) and in recently drinking alcohol abusing subjects (Bode et al., 2001).


The mucosal damage caused by alcohol might result in an impaired intestinal barrier function, enabling toxins of gut-inhabiting bacteria such as endotoxins to enter the systemic circulation and to contribute to liver injury after alcohol consumption.

An ethanol-induced increase in intestinal permeability was also reported in human subjects when smaller molecules were used as a permeability probe.


The permeability to PEG Mr 400 was found to be unchanged when compared to healthy controls, whereas the permeability to PEG Mr 1500 and Mr 4000 were distinctly enhanced and the prevalence of increased permeability to PEG 10000 was more than 10-fold higher in alcoholics (Parlesak et al., 2000).


These studies clearly indicate that alcohol can increase intestinal permeability to various macromolecules including endotoxin.

A similar protective role of EGF on acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions was also demonstrated in human colonic mucosa (Basuroy et al., 2005).


These researchers further demonstrated that L-glutamine protects the intestinal barrier function by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism. A similar protective role of L-glutamine on acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions was also demonstrated in human colonic mucosa (Basuroy et al., 2005).


Oat supplementation ameliorated all of these changes (Keshavarzian et al., 2001). Studies are required to understand the mechanisms by which oat supplement preserves intestinal permeability.

Furthermore, plasma endotoxin levels were also significantly elevated in actively drinking alcoholics without evidence of liver disease (Bode et al., 1987; Nolan, 1989), suggesting that alcohol itself can increase endotoxin levels presumably via increasing intestinal permeability to endotoxin.


Endotoxemia was reversible in the majority of patients with alcoholic fatty liver and in about 50\% of patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis within 1 week following the cessation of alcohol intake (Fukui et al., 1991), further suggesting a direct role of alcohol in increasing plasma endotoxin levels.


In mice, plasma endotoxin levels were significantly elevated 1.5 hour after intragastric administration of 6g/kg ethanol by gavage, and this was associated with significant small intestinal injury (Lambert et al., 2003).


These mice developed significant liver injury 6 hours after ethanol administration, suggesting that alcohol is the causal factor for endotoxemia. Both human and animal studies suggest that alcohol mediates the transfer of endotoxin from intestine to the liver that results in the elevation of plasma enotoxin levels.

In an intragstric infusion rat model of alcoholic liver injury, sterilization of intestine by antibiotics significantly attenuated liver injury by reducing plasma levels of endotoxin (Adachi et al., 1995), and in the same model, similar results were obtained by simultaneous feeding of probiotic lactobacillus GG bacteria (competitive inhibitor of Gram negative bacteria) to the rats (Nanji et al., 1994).

In the gastrointestinal tract, acetaldehyde can be generated from ethanol through mucosal and/or bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Seitz and Oneta, 1998).


Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the colonic lumen could be due to low efficiency of bacterial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to metabolize acetaldehyde in the colon (Nosova et al., 1998).


However, ethanol up to 5\% concentration failed to increase paracellular permeability, suggesting that ethanol metabolism to acetaldehyde is required for the action.


This study showed that ethanol increased paracellular permeability at 7.5\% concentration.


The importance of ethanol metabolism into acetaldehyde was further confirmed when acetaldehyde, and not ethanol, was shown to increase mucosal permeability in proximal rat colonic strips


In this study, investigators demonstrated that acetaldehyde induced disruption of interactions between E-cadherin, β-catenin and PTP1B by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting that this may be a mechanism whereby acetaldehyde impairs intestinal permeability.

Mice were treated with three intragastric doses of zinc sulfate at 5 mg zinc element/kg each dosing, with an interval of 12 hours, prior to acute ethanol challenge with a single oral dose of 6 g/kg ethanol.


Zinc supplementation attenuated ethanol-induced increases in serum endotoxin levels, serum ALT activity, and hepatic TNF-α levels. These changes were associated with prevention of ethanol-induced liver injury (Lambert et al., 2003; Lambert et al., 2004).


These results suggest that zinc brought these changes, at least in part, by preventing ethanol-induced transfer of endotoxin from intestine to circulation which could be ascribed to preservation of intestinal morphology and permeability.

n this study, ethanol exposure (1\%, 2.5\%, and 15\%) increased expression of iNOS and increased production of NO and superoxide.


Pretreatment with iNOS inhibitor (L-N6-1-iminoethyl-lysine), peroxynitrite scavengers (urate or L-cysteine) or superoxide anion scavenger (superoxide dismutase) attenuated the damage caused by ethanol.


These results suggest that NO and superoxide anion generated in response to ethanol exposure may react with each other to form peroxynitrite which in turn may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequently disrupt intestinal barrier function.


These researchers further showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) may protect intestinal barrier function by stabilizing cytoskeleton via down regulating the activity of iNOS (Banan et al., 2003).

Overgrowth of Gram negative bacteria can result in increased production of endotoxin which can escape into portal circulation leading to increased plasma levels of endotoxin.


These studies suggest that chronic alcohol abuse can promote bacterial growth in the intestine;


Suppressing the growth of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine may reduce the amount of endotoxin which in turn may attenuate endotoxin-associated organ damage.


Whether probiotic treatment can attenuate ALD in humans needs further investigation.

	abstract = {Introduction
Previous research has shown that heavy cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on neurocognitive functions. Animal studies suggest that chronic cannabis consumption may also produce cross-tolerance for the impairing effects of alcohol, but supportive data in humans is scarce.

Purpose
The present study was designed to assess tolerance and cross-tolerance to the neurocognitive effects of THC and alcohol in heavy cannabis users.

Methods
Twenty-one heavy cannabis users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way study. Subjects underwent three alcohol-dosing conditions that were designed to achieve a steady blood alcohol concentration of about 0, 0.5, and 0.7 mg/ml during a 5-h time window. In addition, subjects smoked a THC cigarette (400 μg/kg) at 3 h post-onset of alcohol dosing during every alcohol condition. Performance tests were conducted repeatedly between 0 and 7 h after onset of drinking and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided-attention task), motor inhibition (stop-signal task), and cognition (Tower of London).

Results
Alcohol significantly impaired critical tracking, divided attention, and stop-signal performance. THC generally did not affect task performance. However, combined effects of THC and alcohol on divided attention were bigger than those by alcohol alone.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study generally confirms that heavy cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing effects of THC on neurocognitive task performance. Yet, heavy cannabis users did not develop cross-tolerance to the impairing effects of alcohol, and the presence of the latter even selectively potentiated THC effects on measures of divided attention.},

Urinary acetylcarnitine content significantly increased following administration of ethanol plus carnitine, but not when L-carnitine alone was administered.

	abstract = {Background
Differential propensity for hangover may play a role in determining individuals’ drinking practices so predictors of incidence and severity are needed.

Methods
Data were combined from three randomized crossover trials investigating the residual effects of heavy drinking on next-day performance. All 172 participants received either an alcoholic beverage (M=.115 g\% breath alcohol concentration [BrAC]) or placebo matched on type and amount one night and a week later received the other beverage. Alcoholic beverages were vodka, bourbon or high alcohol beer. After each drinking session, following a 9-hour period for sleep and breakfast, participants completed questionnaire a hangover measure.

Results
No hangover was reported by 24\% of participants, mild hangover by 44\% and moderate hangover by 32\%. Neither alcoholic beverage type nor participant characteristics (sex, age, drinking practices, tobacco use, or family history of alcohol problems) were associated with incidence of hangover.

Conclusion
The majority of people experienced mild to moderate hangover the morning after this level of intoxication. Further studies are required to investigate other hypothesized causes of variation in the propensity for hangover.},

Ethanol-induced protein thiol oxidation was most severe in mice fed Gln-free diet and absent in mice fed Gln-supplemented diet, suggesting that antioxidant effect is one of the likely mechanisms involved in Gln-mediated amelioration of ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction.


These results indicate that Gln supplementation ameliorates alcohol-induced gut and liver injury.


Our previous studies in Caco-2 cell monolayers showed that Gln ameliorates acetaldehyde-induced increase in paracellular permeability in an intestinal epithelium in vitro [29].


The results of present study demonstrate that dietary Gln is beneficial in preventing alcohol-induced intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction in vivo.


Interestingly, alcohol-induced increase in mucosal permeability was confined to distal colon. The reason for restriction of alcohol-induced mucosal permeability to distal colon is unclear at this time. It is possible that the barrier function of the proximal colon and small intestine is also compromised by ethanol, but the barrier is restored in these segments much faster than the distal colon.


For instance, saccharolytic bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids are high in the proximal colon.


Gln replacement in Gln-free diet dose-dependently blocked the effect of chronic ethanol consumption on gut barrier function. This observation suggests that Gln in regular diet is protective against ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, and that the Gln supply in the regular diet is insufficient to completely prevent the ethanol effect. Gln supplementation at 2-fold the regular dietary dose is required for more effective amelioration of ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction.


Therefore, Gln supplementation protects both tight junctions and adherens junctions in the colonic epithelium of ethanol fed mice.


Interestingly, ethanol-induced elevation of plasma ALT and liver triglyceride was similar in mice fed Gln free diet and Gln supplementation at normal dietary dose. This observation suggests that dietary Gln under regular dietary dose is not high enough to suppress alcoholic fatty liver. However, Gln supplementation at 2-fold the regular dietary dose significantly ameliorated ethanol-induced elevation of plasma ALT and liver triglyceride content.

	abstract = {The pharmacological activities and acute toxicity of the psilocin (PC) and dried residues of the crude extracts of psychotropic mushrooms were investigated in mice. The hallucinogenic substances were effectively isolated, by using methanol, from the species of Psilocybe semilanceata and Pholiotina cyanopus, that were collected in the north-east region of Poland. The chemical analysis of these extracts, which was performed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS), indicated the presence of psilocin and other hallucinogenic substances, including indolealkylamines and their phosphorylated analogues. When the pure psilocin or fungal extracts were used, slight differences in determined LD50 values were observed. However, the application of PC evoked the highest level of toxicity (293.07 mg/kg) compared to the activity of extracts from Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata, where the level of LD50 was 316.87 mg/kg and 324.37 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the behavioral test, which considered the head-twitching response (HTR), was used to assess the effects of the studied psychotropic factors on the serotonergic system. Both, the fungal extracts and psilocin evoked characteristic serotoninergic effects depending on the dose administered to mice, acting as an agonist/partial agonist on the serotonergic system. A dose of 200 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced spontaneous head-twitching in mice (100\% effect), as a result of the formation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain. Compared to the activity of 5-HTP, the intraperitoneal administration of 1mg/kg of psilocin or hallucinogenic extracts of studied mushrooms (Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata) reduced the number of head-twitch responses of about 46\% and 30\%, respectively. In contrast, the administration of PC exhibited a reduction of about 60\% in HTR numbers.},

	url = {http://www.medscimonit.com/download/index/idArt/878140},
	abstract = {[b]Background[/b]
The aim was to study the effects of a single large dose of ethanol (approximately 2.0 g/kg of body weight, as 40\% vodka) on the specific activities of alpha-mannosidase, alpha-fucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-galactosidase as well as on the total protein concentration in saliva in eight healthy young volunteers.
[b]Material and Method[/b]
Resting whole saliva samples were collected 12 hours prior to and 36 and 108 hours after alcohol consumption. Exoglycosidase activities were assayed in the supernatants by the colorimetric method. Protein content was determined by the Lowry method.
[b]Results[/b]
Thirty-six hours after alcohol consumption the specific activities of alpha-fucosidase and beta-glucuronidase were significantly higher than before drinking. The specific activity of beta-galactosidase showed a greater tendency to increase than alpha-mannosidase after the drinking session. The total protein concentration was significantly lower after alcohol consumption than at baseline, even at 108 hr. Significant inverse correlations between total protein content and the specific activities of the exoglycosidases in saliva were found after the drinking session.
[b]Conclusions[/b]
Acute ingestion of a large dose of ethanol increased the activity of salivary exoglycosidases, which might be followed by subsequent degradation of proteins in saliva. The observed changes might contribute to salivary defense system malfunction as well as to oral malodor production.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ethanol (EtOH), like other drugs of abuse, increases extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) of the brain reward system, an effect that may be of importance for alcohol addiction. How this DA increase is produced is not fully understood, although previous studies from the present laboratories indicate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the ventral tegmental area play an important role in mediating this effect. Furthermore, activation of these receptors may be secondary to some priming effect produced by EtOH in the nAc. We recently demonstrated that strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyRs) are present in the nAc and that they are involved in regulating extracellular DA levels. Here we examine the tentative role of these accumbal GlyRs in the above-mentioned priming mechanism of EtOH.
METHOD: In vivo microdialysis (coupled to high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) and reversed microdialysis, in awake, freely moving adult male Wistar rats.
RESULTS: Local perfusion of strychnine decreased accumbal DA levels per se and completely prevented the increase of accumbal DA levels after both local and systemic EtOH administration. Accumbal perfusion of the GlyR agonist glycine instead increased DA levels in a subpopulation of rats and prevented the EtOH-induced increase after local but not systemic EtOH in all animals.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that GlyRs in the nAc might constitute targets for EtOH in its mesolimbic DA-activating effect. Gene polymorphism and drug developmental studies that focus on this receptor population and its relation to alcohol dependence are warranted.},

	abstract = {Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) can be caused by novel or unaccustomed exercise and results in a temporary decrease in muscle force production, a rise in passive tension, increased muscle soreness and swelling, and an increase in intramuscular proteins in blood. Consequently, EIMD can have a profound effect on the ability to perform subsequent bouts of exercise and therefore adhere to an exercise training programme. A variety of interventions have been used prophylactically and/or therapeutically in an attempt to reduce the negative effects associated with EIMD. This article focuses on some of the most commonly used strategies, including nutritional and pharmacological strategies, electrical and manual therapies and exercise. Long-term supplementation with antioxidants or beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate appears to provide a prophylactic effect in reducing EIMD, as does the ingestion of protein before and following exercise. Although the administration of high-dose NSAIDs may reduce EIMD and muscle soreness, it also attenuates the adaptive processes and should therefore not be prescribed for long-term treatment of EIMD. Whilst there is some evidence that stretching and massage may reduce muscle soreness, there is little evidence indicating any performance benefits. Electrical therapies and cryotherapy offer limited effect in the treatment of EIMD; however, inconsistencies in the dose and frequency of these and other interventions may account for the lack of consensus regarding their efficacy. Both as a cause and a consequence of this, there are very few evidence-based guidelines for the application of many of these interventions. Conversely, there is unequivocal evidence that prior bouts of eccentric exercise provide a protective effect against subsequent bouts of potentially damaging exercise. Further research is warranted to elucidate the most appropriate dose and frequency of interventions to attenuate EIMD and if these interventions attenuate the adaptation process. This will both clarify the efficacy of such strategies and provide guidelines for evidence-based practice.},

The alcohol hangover is an intriguing issue since it is unknown why these symptoms are present after alcohol and its metabolites are eliminated from the body.


Many people favour the (unproven) popular belief that dehydration is the main cause of alcohol hangover symptoms. However, taking a closer look at the present research on biological changes during alcohol hangovers suggests otherwise.


Significant changes were reported on endocrine parameters (increased concentrations of vasopressin, aldosterone, and renin) and metabolic acidosis (reduced blood pH values due to increased concentrations of lactate, ketone bodies, and free fatty acids).


In addition, changes in immune system parameters (increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine  [IL-12] and interferon-gamma [IFNγ]) have been reported (Kim et al., 2003).


Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that not dehydration, but a stressor causes an immune response which results in memory problems.


Since the biology of hangovers is not well  understood, it is not surprising that the design of experiments and the included psychological tests lack an evidence-based rationale.


As summarized in Figure 1, it can be concluded that alcoholic drinks that contain more congeners produce more severe alcohol hangovers.


The resulting daytime sleepiness is significantly related to several affects that are generally ascribed to be alcohol hangover symptoms.

However, evolutionary analyses aimed at exploring the evolution of muscarine, a toxin that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, and psilocybin, a hallucinogen, have never been performed. The known taxonomic distribution of muscarine within the Inocybaceae is limited, based only on assays of species from temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Here, we present a review of muscarine and psilocybin assays performed on species of Inocybaceae during the last fifty years. To supplement these results, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine whether muscarine was present in 30 new samples of Inocybaceae, the majority of which have not been previously assayed or that originated from either the tropics or temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. Our main objective is to test the hypothesis that the presence of muscarine is a shared ancestral feature of the Inocybaceae. In addition, we also test whether species of Inocyabceae that produce psilocybin are monophyletic. Our findings suggest otherwise. Muscarine has evolved independently on several occasions, together with several losses. We also detect at least two independent transitions of muscarine-free lineages to psilocybin-producing states. Although not ancestral for the family as a whole, muscarine is a shared derived trait for an inclusive clade containing three of the seven major lineages of Inocybaceae (the Inocybe, Nothocybe, and Pseudosperma clades), the common ancestor of which may have evolved ca. 60 million years ago. Thus, muscarine represents a conserved trait followed by several recent losses. Transitions to psilocybin from muscarine-producing ancestors occurred more recently between 10-20 million years ago after muscarine loss in two separate lineages. Statistical analyses firmly reject a single origin of muscarine-producing taxa.},

Both were given in placebo-controlled designs and produced marked subjective effects, although reports of more profound changes in consciousness were given after psilocybin. Between-network RSFC was generally increased under psilocybin, implying that networks become less differentiated from each other in the psychedelic state. Decreased RSFC between visual and sensorimotor RSNs was also observed. MDMA had a notably less marked effect on between-network RSFC, implying that the extensive changes observed under psilocybin may be exclusive to classic psychedelic drugs and related to their especially profound effects on consciousness.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether zinc pretreatment would inhibit acute ethanol-induced liver injury through prevention of intestinal permeability changes. Male 129 SvPCJ mice were treated with three intragastric doses of ZnSO4 at 5 mg of zinc ion per kg each dosing prior to acute ethanol challenge with a single oral dose of 6 g/kg ethanol. The zinc treatment did not alter the elevation of serum concentrations of alcohol. The acute ethanol exposure caused an elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase levels as well as fatty liver and hepatic degenerative necrotic foci as determined by biochemical assay and histochemical analysis, respectively. A significant increase in liver tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These pathological effects correlated well with increases in serum endotoxin levels. Importantly, acute ethanol treatment caused significant damage to the small intestine as determined by morphological analysis of intestinal sections and permeability assay. These alcohol-induced hepatic pathological changes and TNF-α elevation were significantly inhibited in the zinc-pretreated animals. The inhibitory action of zinc on alcohol-induced liver damage and activation of inflammation was associated with zinc suppression of alcohol-induced intestinal permeability changes. These results thus demonstrate that zinc prevention of increased intestinal permeability is importantly involved in the inhibition of acute ethanol-induced liver damage in mice.},

METHODS: Forty adult patients with severe trauma according to the Injury Severity Score {\textgreater}20 were enrolled in this randomized, controlled study. The patients were assigned to two groups: Group G received 0.5 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide supplementation IV, and Group C received a control solution without alanyl-glutamine for 7 days. Blood samples were taken for analysis of glutathione before the initiation of supplementation and on the 3rd, 7th, and 10th days of feeding.
RESULTS: Total plasma glutathione levels significantly increased in Group G when compared with Group C on Days 7 and 10 (1.34 +/- 0.20 microM vs 1.13 +/- 0.14 microM, and 1.38 +/- 0.19 microM vs 1.12 +/- 0.16 microM) (P {\textless} 0.001).

Four days after reperfusion, both motor and proprioception functions were assessed and then all rats were sacrificed for determination of brain infarct volume (2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), apoptosis (TUNEL staining), edema (both cerebral water content and amounts of aquaporin-4 positive cells), gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-positive cells), and neurotoxicity (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS] expression).ResultsThe results showed that agmatine treatment was found to accelerate recovery of motor (from 55 degrees to 62 degrees) and proprioception (from 54\% maximal possible effect to 10\% maximal possible effect) deficits and to prevent brain infarction (from 370 mm3 to 50 mm3), gliosis (from 80 GFAP-positive cells to 30 GFAP-positive cells), edema (cerebral water contents decreased from 82.5\% to 79.4\%; AQP4 positive cells decreased from 140 to 84 per section), apoptosis (neuronal apoptotic cells decreased from 100 to 20 per section), and neurotoxicity (iNOS expression cells decreased from 64 to 7 per section) during MCAO ischemic injury in rats.ConclusionsThe data suggest that agmatine may improve outcomes of transient cerebral ischemia in rats by reducing brain apoptosis, astrogliosis and edema.},

	abstract = {Chronic intake of alcohol undoubtedly overwhelms the structural and functional capacity of the liver by initiating complex pathological events characterized by steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Subsequently, these initial pathological events are sustained and ushered into a more complex and progressive liver disease, increasing the risk of fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. These coordinated pathological events mainly result from buildup of toxic metabolic derivatives of alcohol including but not limited to acetaldehyde (AA), malondialdehyde (MDA), CYP2E1-generated reactive oxygen species, alcohol-induced gut-derived lipopolysaccharide, AA/MDA protein and DNA adducts. The metabolic derivatives of alcohol together with other comorbidity factors, including hepatitis B and C viral infections, dysregulated iron metabolism, abuse of antibiotics, schistosomiasis, toxic drug metabolites, autoimmune disease and other non-specific factors, have been shown to underlie liver diseases. In view of the multiple etiology of liver diseases, attempts to delineate the mechanism by which each etiological factor causes liver disease has always proved cumbersome if not impossible. In the case of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), it is even more cumbersome and complicated as a result of the many toxic metabolic derivatives of alcohol with their varying liver-specific toxicities. In spite of all these hurdles, researchers and experts in hepatology have strived to expand knowledge and scientific discourse, particularly on ALD and its associated complications through the medium of scientific research, reviews and commentaries. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underpinning ALD, particularly those underlying toxic effects of metabolic derivatives of alcohol on parenchymal and non-parenchymal hepatic cells leading to increased risk of alcohol-induced fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis, are still incompletely elucidated. In this review, we examined published scientific findings on how alcohol and its metabolic derivatives mount cellular attack on each hepatic cell and the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to disruption of core hepatic homeostatic functions which probably set the stage for the initiation and progression of ALD to fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. We also brought to sharp focus, the complex and integrative role of transforming growth factor beta/small mothers against decapentaplegic/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling nexus as well as their cross-signaling with toll-like receptor-mediated gut-dependent signaling pathways implicated in ALD and fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. Looking into the future, it is hoped that these deliberations may stimulate new research directions on this topic and shape not only therapeutic approaches but also models for studying ALD and fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis.},

Efficient functioning of these two hepatic alcohol metabolic processes ensure that toxic metabolites of alcohol, mainly AA (a hepatotoxin as well as a neurotoxin), MDA (a hepatotoxin) and some other unstable derivatives of the metabolites including CYP2E1-generated free radicals, protein adducts of AA and MDA, are rendered inactive or cleared from the system long before they cause any cellular damage.


Interestingly, it was reported that CYP2E1 activity may be induced about two to tenfold after chronic alcohol exposure and the underlying mechanism was linked to oxidative stress[36].


It was reported that alcohol exposure induces fatty liver disease by increasing NADH/NAD+ ratio[41]. It remains to be established whether alcohol-induced NADH/NAD+ turnover underlies reprogramming and switching energy metabolism of pre-neoplastic hepatic cells from efficient mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation to that of inefficient but protective aerobic glycolysis (so-called Warburg effect).

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (71\%, 56\%, and 41\% of control) and glutathione reductase (GR) (71\%, 66\%, and 55\% of control) activity in plasma were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Catalase (CAT)/SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)/SOD ratios were significantly increased whereas GR/GSH-Px ratio was significantly decreased with increasing dose of ethanol. In a time course study, plasma ethanol concentrations were 177± 9.7, 143± 11, 99± 17, and 26± 11 mg/dl at 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 h after an oral dose (4 g/kg) of ethanol in rat indicating time-dependent elimination of ethanol. Plasma SOD and GSH-Px activity significantly increased 4–6 h whereas GR activity significantly decreased 2–4 h after ethanol ingestion. The ratio of GR/GSH-Px and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in plasma decreased at 1.5–6 h after ethanol ingestion. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly elevated with respect to an increase in time after ethanol ingestion, indicating time-dependent augmentation of lipid peroxidation. The data indicate that ethanol ingestion perturbs the plasma antioxidant system in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The significant changes in the ratios of CAT/SOD, GSH-Px/SOD, GR/GSH-Px, and GSH/GSSG in plasma may be used as an index of alcohol-induced oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {This article provides an overview of neural models of synaptic learning and memory whose expression in adaptive behavior depends critically on the circuits and systems in which the synapses are embedded. It reviews Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, models that use excitatory matching and match-based learning to achieve fast category learning and whose learned memories are dynamically stabilized by top-down expectations, attentional focusing, and memory search. ART clarifies mechanistic relationships between consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. ART models are embedded in ARTSCAN architectures that unify processes of invariant object category learning, recognition, spatial and object attention, predictive remapping, and eye movement search, and that clarify how conscious object vision and recognition may fail during perceptual crowding and parietal neglect. The generality of learned categories depends upon a vigilance process that is regulated by acetylcholine via the nucleus basalis. Vigilance can get stuck at too high or too low values, thereby causing learning problems in autism and medial temporal amnesia. Similar synaptic learning laws support qualitatively different behaviors: Invariant object category learning in the inferotemporal cortex; learning of grid cells and place cells in the entorhinal and hippocampal cortices during spatial navigation; and learning of time cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal system during adaptively timed conditioning, including trace conditioning. Spatial and temporal processes through the medial and lateral entorhinal-hippocampal system seem to be carried out with homologous circuit designs. Variations of a shared laminar neocortical circuit design have modeled 3D vision, speech perception, and cognitive working memory and learning. A complementary kind of inhibitory matching and mismatch learning controls movement.},

In this study, both advantageous and disadvantageous functions of curcumin on alcoholic liver injury were observed. In order to determine the effects of curcumin on liver fibrosis induced by alcohol, 5\% ethanol and/or curcumin (1 × 10–3 or 1 × 10–4 m) were injected intravenously in mice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to determine the value of liver injury by optical density analyses. Liver histology was evaluated by an experienced hepatopathologist blinded to the type of treatment received by the animals. Ethanol accelerates serum levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver injury, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) during 5\% ethanol-induced liver injury. 1 × 10–3 m curcumin accelerates liver injury and liver cellular edema during only 5\% ethanol-induced liver injury evolution, whereas 1 × 10–4 m curcumin does not lead to (or protect) alcoholic liver injury. Therefore, it is suggested that curcumin may have dual effects on alcoholic liver injury depending on its concentration. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Contemporary approaches to biology often call for the high-throughput production of large amounts of numerous proteins for structural or functional studies. Even with the highly efficient protein expression systems developed in Escherichia coli, production of these proteins is laborious and time-consuming. We have simplified established protocols by the use of disposable culture vessels: common 2-liter polyethylene terephthalate beverage bottles. The bottles are inexpensive, fit conveniently in commonly available flask holders, and, because they are notched, provide sufficient aeration to support the growth of high-density cultures. The use of antibiotics and freshly prepared media alleviates the need for sterilization of media and significantly reduces the labor involved. Uninoculated controls exhibited no growth during the time required for protein expression in experimental cultures. The yield, solubility, activity, and pattern of crystallization of proteins expressed in bottles were comparable to those obtained under conventional culture conditions. After use, the bottles are discarded, reducing the risk of cross-contamination of subsequent cultures. The approach appears to be suitable for high-throughput production of proteins for structural or functional studies.},

	abstract = {Alcohol has been reported to have appetite-stimulating properties in humans. The underlying mechanism is unknown. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY), could be involved as mediators of the alcohol effect because ghrelin stimulates the appetite and PYY appears to induce satiety. This investigation was undertaken with the intention to study that issue. Twelve young and healthy volunteers of both sexes participated in 2 experiments (experiments A and B), which were performed in random order 1 week apart. Alcohol (0.55 g ethanol per kilogram) was ingested in experiment A, drinking water in experiment B. Venous blood samples were collected before and repeatedly after the drinks. Serum concentrations of total ghrelin, octanoylated ghrelin (the bioactive form of the hormone), PYY, and ethanol were determined over a period of 5 hours. In experiment A, the ethanol level increased from 0 to 12.5 ± 0.7 mmol/L in 1 hour (P {\textless} .001), and then began to decrease. In experiment B, the ethanol level remained at zero throughout the entire experiment. Alcohol induced significant declines in total and octanoylated ghrelin concentrations from 30 minutes on. The total ghrelin level reached its lowest point 5 hours after the alcohol intake (36\% ± 4\% below the basal level; P {\textless} .001). The octanoylated ghrelin level fell 48\% ± 5\% below the basal level in 2 hours (P {\textless} .001) and then tended to level out. Drinking water left both total and octanoylated ghrelin levels unaffected. The PYY level remained unchanged after both alcohol and water ingestion. Alcohol has a strong inhibitory influence on human ghrelin secretion, but has no effect on circulating PYY levels. This makes it unlikely that the orexigenic effect of alcohol is mediated by either of these 2 hormones.},

In this study, sixty-six adult Russian males admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholic psychosis were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial to study the effects of alcohol and probiotics on the bowel flora and alcohol-induced liver injury. Patients were randomized to receive 5 days of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum 8PA3 vs. standard therapy alone (abstinence plus vitamins). Stool cultures and liver enzymes were performed at baseline and again after therapy. Results were compared between groups and with 24 healthy, matched controls who did not consume alcohol. Compared to healthy controls, alcoholic patients had significantly reduced numbers of bifidobacteria (6.3 vs. 7.5 log CFU/g), lactobacilli (3.15 vs. 4.59 log CFU/g), and enterococci (4.43 vs. 5.5 log CFU/g). The mean baseline AST, ALT and GGT activities were significantly elevated in the alcoholic group when compared to the healthy control group (AST: 104.1 vs. 29.15 U/L; ALT: 50.49 vs. 22.96 U/L; GGT 161.5 vs. 51.88 U/L) indicating that these patients did have mild alcohol-induced liver injury. After 5 days of probiotic therapy, alcoholic patients had significantly increased numbers of both bifidobacteria (7.9 vs. 6.81 log CFU/g) and lactobacilli (4.2 vs. 3.2 log CFU/g) when compared to the standard therapy arm. Despite similar values at study initiation, patients treated with probiotics had significantly lower AST and ALT activity at the end of treatment than those treated with standard therapy alone (AST: 54.67 vs. 76.43 U/L; ALT 36.69 vs. 51.26 U/L). In a subgroup of 26 subjects with well-characterized mild alcoholic hepatitis (defined as AST and ALT greater than 30 U/L with AST to ALT ratio greater than one), probiotic therapy was associated with a significant end of treatment reduction in ALT, AST, GGT, LDH and total bilirubin. In this subgroup, there was a significant end of treatment mean ALT reduction in the probiotic arm vs. the standard therapy arm. In conclusion, patients with alcohol-induced liver injury have altered bowel flora when compared to healthy controls. Short-term oral supplementation with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum 8PA3 was associated with restoration of the bowel flora and greater improvement in alcohol-induced liver injury than standard therapy alone.},

The spaces between the module pairs serve as the air heating channels, the channels being connected to common air inlet and discharge headers. The system was tested experimentally under daytime no-load conditions at Nsukka, Nigeria, over the ambient temperature range of 19-41 ??C, and a daily global irradiation range of 4.9-19.9 MJ m-2. Peak temperature rise of the heated air was about 15 K, while the maximum airflow rate and peak cumulative useful efficiency were about 0.058 kg s-1 and 22\%, respectively. These results show that the system can be operated successfully for crop drying applications. With suitable valves to control the working chamber temperature, it can also operate as a poultry egg incubator. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The main goals of this study were: (i) to examine genotypic association of the COMT val158met polymorphism with anxiety-related traits via a meta-analysis; (ii) to examine sex and ethnicity as moderators of the association, and (iii) to evaluate whether the association differed by particular anxiety traits.

Methods
Association studies of the COMT val18met polymorphism and anxiety traits were identified from the PubMed or PsycInfo databases, conference abstracts and listserv postings. Exclusion criteria were: (a) pediatric samples, (b) exclusively clinical samples, and (c) samples selected for a non-anxiety phenotype. Standardized mean differences in anxiety between genotypes were aggregated to produce mean effect sizes across all available samples, and for subgroups stratified by sex and ethnicity (Caucasians vs. Asians). Construct-specific analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of COMT with neuroticism, harm avoidance, and behavioral inhibition.

Results
Twenty seven eligible studies (N=15,979) with available data were identified. Overall findings indicate sex-specific and ethnic-specific effects: Val homozygotes had higher neuroticism than Met homozygotes in studies of Caucasian males (
ES¯=0.13, 95\%CI: 0.02 – 0.25, p = 0.03), and higher harm avoidance in studies of Asian males (
ES¯=0.43, 95\%CI: 0.14 – 0.72, p = 0.004). No significant associations were found in women and effect sizes were diminished when studies were aggregated across ethnicity or anxiety traits., Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence for sex and ethnicity differences in the association of the COMT val158met polymorphism with anxiety traits. Our findings contribute to current knowledge on the relation between prefrontal dopaminergic transmission and anxiety.},

Our purpose was to investigate the effect of dietary glycine during recovery from early alcohol-induced injury, using a model that mimics the clinical presentation and histopathology with alcoholics. Male Wistar rats were exposed to ethanol continuously for 6 wk via intragastric feeding that resulted in typical histology of alcoholic liver injury, including steatosis, inflammation, necrosis and increased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. After cessation of ethanol, one group of rats received a control diet, the other a glycine-containing diet for 2 wk. During this period, all parameters studied tended to return to baseline values. However, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase recovered about 30\% more rapidly in rats fed glycine. Further, the hepatic pathology score was also significantly lower in the glycine group than in controls (0.5vs. 2.6). After 1 wk, steatosis was reduced significantly more in the glycine group (5.6\%) than in controls (8.9\%). Glycine also diminished numbers of infiltrating leukocytes and necrotic cells significantly more than in controls. This beneficial effect of glycine may be partly explained by the fact that glycine increased influx of chloride into Kupffer cells leading to diminished tumor necrosis factor-α production. These results indicate that a glycine containing diet expedites the process of recovery from ethanol-induced liver injury and may lead to its clinical application in alcoholic hepatitis.},

	abstract = {We have investigated in the current study the possible protective effects of two carnitine esters known to have powerful anti-oxidant potential namely, propionyl l-carnitine (PLC) and acetyl l-carnitine (AC) against alcohol-induced gastric lesions in rats. Both drugs were administered as a single oral dose of 200mgkg−1 body weight 1h before alcohol intake. Both carnitine esters could protect the gastric mucosa against the injurious effect of absolute alcohol and promote ulcer healing as evidenced from the ulcer index (UI) values. Propionyl l-carnitine prevented alcohol-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation. The propionyl carnitine ester also increased the gastric content of reduced glutathione (GSH), besides it increased the enzymatic activities of gastric superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Likewise, AC did protect against the ulcerating effect of alcohol and mitigate most of the biochemical adverse effects induced by alcohol in gastric mucosa, but to a lesser extent than PLC. Neither PLC nor AC did affect catalase activity in gastric tissue. Based on these observations, one could conclude that carnitine esters, particularly PLC could partly protect gastric mucosa from alcohol-induced acute mucosal injury, and these gastroprotective effects might be probably induced, at least partly, through anti-oxidant mechanisms.},

"Both drugs were administered as a single oral dose of 200 mg kg−1 body weight 1 h before alcohol intake." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:285)
"Based on these observations, one could conclude that carnitine esters, particularly PLC could partly protect gastric mucosa from alcohol-induced acute mucosal injury, and these gastroprotective effects might be probably induced, at least partly, through anti-oxidant mechanisms." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:285)
"The concept that carnitines have shown powerful antioxidant properties in a host of studies has prompted us to investigate in the current study the possible gastroprotective effects of two carnitine esters namely, propionyll-carnitine and acetyll-carnitine against alcohol-induced mucosal damage. Ulcer index (UI) and various anti-oxidants; enzymatic and non-enzymatic, were among the investigated biological endpoints." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:286)
"Intake of absolute alcohol induced severe and extensive macroscopic gastric mucosal damage characterised by elongated haemorrhagic lesions confined mainly to the gastric corpus and running parallel to the long axis of the stomach that had the highest ulcer scoring rate (Fig. 1)." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"Pre-treatment of rats with a single oral dose of PLC did reduce the ulcer index by 40\% compared to the animals" (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
Pre-treatment of rats with a single oral dose of PLC did reduce the ulcer index by 40\% compared to the animals that received alcohol alone. (note on p.287)
 
"Similarly, prior administration of AC could protect the animals against the ulcerating effect of alcohol, as evidenced by a decrease in the ulcer index amounted to 34\%." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"Alcohol administration markedly stimulated lipid peroxidation in gastric tissues, and the MDA content was elevated by about 125.5\% compared to control animals (Table 1)." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"Alcohol also decreased the gastric level of GSH by about 52\%." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"The SOD activity was decreased by 65\%, while that of GST was reduced by about 58.5\% compared to the control values (Table 1). The CAT activity was unchanged after alcohol intake." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"Pre-treatment with PLC significantly reduced the MDA content in rat stomach by 67\% compared to animals given alcohol alone." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:287)
"the gastric MDA content, but to a lesser extent amounted to 39\%." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
Acetyl L-carnitine, did also decrease the gastric MDA content, but to a lesser extent amounted to 39\%. (note on p.288)
 
"Administration of PLC to rats ahead of alcohol intake increased the gastric GSH content by 32\%. However, there was no significant change in gastric GSH observed following AC administration compared to animals received alcohol alone (Table 1)." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Prior administration of PLC to rats markedly increased the gastric activity of SOD by about 242\%. Likewise, AC increased the enzymatic activity of SOD by 200\% compared to animals that received alcohol alone." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Pre-treatment of rats with either PLC or AC exhibited the same increase in the enzyme activity of gastric GST, which was amounted to about 119\% (Table 1)." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Neither PLC nor AC administered before alcohol had any effect on the CAT activity of gastric mucosa." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Application of absolute alcohol by gastric gavage induced marked damage to the gastric mucosa that was obvious by macroscopic examination." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"It was also apparent that alcohol caused severe oxidative stress in gastric tissue manifested as stimulated lipid peroxidation via increasing MDA content and reduction of gastric GSH content." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Depletion of non-protein sulfhydryls concentrations [15], modulation of nitric oxide system [35], reduction of mucosal blood flow [18], and autonomic nervous system regulation [36], have been suggested to be involved in the development of gastric lesions." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Likewise, prior administration of AC to animals could protect gastric mucosa and ameliorate most of the biochemical adverse effects induced by alcohol application, but to a lesser extent than PLC." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Similarly, quercetin, alphatochopherol, nifedipine and tetracycline were found to possess gastric cytoprotective and gastric ulcer healingpromoting activities that have been attributed to their radical scavenging activities [28]." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Bilici et al. [30] have recently demonstrated that the free radical scavenger; melatonin prevented ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage presumably due to its anti-oxidant property." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:288)
"Based on these broad observations, one could conclude that pre-treatment of rats with carnitine esters; particularly PLC could partly protect the gastric mucosa against the injurious effect of absolute alcohol and promote ulcer healing." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:289)
"Taken together, one could conclude that the gastroprotective effects of both PLC and AC observed in the current study could possibly reside at least in part on their anti-radical effects." (Arafa and Sayed-Ahmed 2003:289)},

Twenty percent of ethanol is absorbed in the stomach and 80\% in the upper small intestine. The Km of CYP2E1 for ethanol is 10 mM, which is roughly one order of magnitude higher than that of ADH1.In the gastric mucosa (and not in the small intestine), 5-10\% of ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase isoform (or isozyme) 7 (ADH7) and this is called gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol [3, 4].Ninety percent of ethanol is metabolized in the liver after multiple passages but the lungs (especially via CYP2E1) also contribute to metabolism.Unchanged ethanol is eliminated in small quantities (approximately 5\% of orally absorbed ethanol) by the kidneys (0.5–2\%), lungs (1.6–6\%) and skin ({\textless}0.5\%) [4]. Indeed, ethanol is primarily bioactivated (92-95\%) by cytosolic (especially hepatic) ADH1B into acetaldehyde, which has proved to have mutagen and carcinogen effects [1].At high blood ethanol levels, the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (CYP2E1 isoform, located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) also has an important role. Ethanol itself induces the activity of CYP2E1, and therefore also influences the metabolism of other xenobiotics ( e.g. paracetemol and cocaine)Catalase is of minor importance (responsible for approximately 5\%) in the metabolism of ethanol. This non-oxidative metabolism is less useful in explaining toxic effects of ethanol, but is highly important for monitoring consumption due to longer half-lives. Indeed, ethanol has a short half-life, which means that it possess a reduced value as an exposure biomarker.

	abstract = {Agmatine, decarboxylated arginine, is produced in the kidney and can increase nephron and kidney filtration rate via renal vasodilatation and increases in plasma flow. This increase in filtration rate after agmatine is prevented by administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. In endothelial cells, agmatine-stimulated nitrite production is accompanied by induction of cytosolic calcium. NOS activity requires calcium for activation; however, the source of this calcium remains unknown. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium-activated calcium release channels are present in the kidney cortex, and we evaluated if RyR contributes to the agmatine response. Agmatine microperfused into Bowman's space reversibly increases nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) by ∼30\%. cADP-ribose (cADPR) regulates RyR channel activity. Concurrent infusion of agmatine with the cADPR blocker 8-bromo-cADPR (2 μM) prevents the increase in filtration rate. Furthermore, direct activation of the RyR channel with ryanodine at agonist concentrations (5 μM) increases SNGFR, and, like agmatine, this increase is prevented by administration of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nonselective NOS blocker. We demonstrate that agmatine does not elicit ADPR cyclase activity in vascular smooth muscle membranes and does not directly affect RyR calcium channel responses using sea urchin egg homogenates. These results imply interplay between endothelial cell cADPR/RyR/Ca2+/NO and the cADPR/RyR/Ca2+ pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells in arterioles in the regulation of kidney filtration rate. In conclusion, we show that agmatine-induced effects require activation of cADPR and RyR calcium release channels for NO generation, vasodilation, and increased filtration rate.},

	abstract = {AIM: Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive oxidant synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO may cause injury through the generation of potent radicals. Nw- nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) is a non-selective inhibitor of NOS. We aimed to evaluate whether L-NAME treatment had protective effects against oxidative stress in rats intragastrically fed with ethanol during a 4 wk-period., METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into 3 equal groups: group 1 (control group-isocaloric dextrose was given), group 2 (6 g/kg·d ethanol-induced group) and group 3 (both ethanol 6 g/kg·d and L-NAME 500 mg/L in drinking water-given group). Animals were sacrificed at the end of 4 wk-experimental period, and intracardiac blood and liver tissues were obtained. Biochemical measurements were performed both in plasma and in homogenized liver tissues. Alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), NO, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by spectrophotometry., RESULTS: ALT and AST in group 2 (62 U/L and 128 U/L, respectively) were higher than those in group 1 (24 U/L and 38 U/L) and group 3 (37 U/L and 81 U/L) (P{\textless}0.001 for both). Plasma and tissue levels of MDA in group 2 (4.66 μmol/L and 0.55 nmol/mg protein) were higher than in group 1 (2.65 μmol/L and 0.34 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (3.43 μmol/L and 0.36 nmol/mg protein) (P{\textless}0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue levels of NO in group 2 (54.67 μmol/L and 586.50 nmol/mg protein) were higher than in group 1 (34.67 μmol/L and 435.33 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (27.50 μmol/L and 412.75 nmol/mg protein ) (P{\textless}0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue SOD activities in group 2 (15.25 U/mL and 5.38 U/ mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (20.00 U/mL and 8.13 U/ mg protein) and group 3 (19.00 U/mL and 6.93 U/ mg protein) (P{\textless}0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue CAT activities in group 2 (145 U/mL and 37 U/ mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (176 U/mL and 73 U/mg protein) and group 3 (167 U/mL and 61 U/mg protein) (P{\textless}0.001 for both). Meanwhile, erythrocytes and liver tissue levels of GSH in group 2 (4.12 mg/g Hb and 5.38 nmol/mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (5.52 mg/g Hb and 4.49 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (5.64 mg/g Hb and 4.18 nmol/mg protein) (P{\textless}0.001 for both)., CONCLUSION: Our findings show that L-NAME may produce a restorative effect on ethanol-induced liver damage via decreasing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant status.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

	abstract = {This purpose of this review will be to summarize the interactions between the endogenous amino acid taurine and ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in the central nervous system (CNS). Taurine is one of the most abundant amino acids in the CNS and plays an integral role in physiological processes such as osmoregulation, neuroprotection and neuromodulation. Both taurine and ethanol exert positive allosteric modulatory effects on neuronal ligand-gated chloride channels (i.e., GABA(A) and glycine receptors) as well as inhibitory effects on other ligand- and voltage-gated cation channels (i.e., NMDA and Ca(2+) channels). Behavioral evidence suggests that taurine can alter the locomotor stimulatory, sedating, and motivational effects of ethanol in a strongly dose-dependent manner. Microdialysis studies have revealed that ethanol elevates extracellular levels of taurine in numerous brain regions, although the functional consequences of this phenomenon are currently unknown. Finally, taurine and several related molecules including the homotaurine derivative acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) can reduce ethanol self-administration and relapse to drinking in both animals and humans. Taken together, these data suggest that the endogenous taurine system may be an important modulator of effects of ethanol on the nervous system, and may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the development of medications to treat alcohol abuse and alcoholism.},

This study attempts to overcome some of the weaknesses of previous research, namely, small sample sizes, clinical samples, ethnic stratification, wide age ranges, neglecting sex differences, and single measures of personality traits. A large sample (n=556, 250 male, 306 female) of healthy Chinese college students (mean age=20.5±1 years) was given a battery of personality scales, including the temperament and character inventory-revised, the behavioral inhibition system and behavioral approach system scale, the Beck depression inventory, and the Beck anxiety inventory. Factor analysis of the affect-related personality traits revealed two factors that corresponded to positive (PEM) and negative emotionality (NEM). We found a consistent COMT-by-sex interaction effect on affect-related personality traits. Compared with males with Met/Met alleles, males with Val/Val alleles showed significantly higher scores on NEM, but lower scores on PEM. Females, however, showed an opposite but nonsignificant pattern. Our results supported the role of the COMT gene in personality traits for males and contributed to the growing literature on sex differences in gene–behavior connections.},

	abstract = {Immunomodulatory effects of alcohol use involve regulation of innate immune cell function leading to liver disease. Alteration of inflammatory responses by alcohol is linked to dysregulated TNF-α production. Alcohol-induced oxidative stress also contributes to alterations in inflammatory cell activity. Heat shock proteins (hsps) and the heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) induced by oxidative stress regulate NF-κB activation and TNF-α gene expression in monocytes and macrophages. Here, we report that in vitro alcohol treatment induced and augmented LPS-induced HSF-1 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity in monocytes and macrophages. Supershift analysis revealed that alcohol regulated HSF-1- and not HSF-2-binding activity. Hsp70, a target gene induced by HSF-1, was transiently increased within 24 h by alcohol, but extended alcohol exposure decreased hsp70 in macrophages. The alcohol-induced alteration of hsp70 correlated with a concomitant change in hsp70 promoter activity. Hsp90, another HSF-1 target gene, was decreased during short-term alcohol but increased after prolonged alcohol exposure. Decreased hsp90-HSF-1 complexes after short-term alcohol indicated dissociation of HSF-1 from hsp90. On the other hand, hsp90 interacted with client protein IκB kinase β, a signaling intermediate of the LPS pathway, followed by IκBα degradation and increased NF-κB activity after chronic alcohol exposure, indicating that hsp90 plays an important role in supporting inflammatory cytokine production. Inhibition of hsp90 using geldanamycin prevented prolonged alcohol-induced elevation in LPS-induced NF-κB and TNF-α production. These results suggest that alcohol exposure differentially regulates hsp70 and hsp90 via HSF-1 activation. Further, hsp90 regulates TNF-α production in macrophages contributing to alcohol-induced inflammation.},

Collectively, our data suggest an important checkpoint role for hsps and their regulator HSF-1 in alcohol-induced TNF-α regulation. Although HSF-1-induced hsp70 in acute alcohol exposure could play an important role in regulation of inhibition of inflammation, hsp90 is supportive to induction of proinflammatory cytokines in alcoholic liver injury. Future in vivo pharmacologic hsp90 inhibitor studies will help provide evidence about the possibility of hsp90 as a target for treatment strategies in alleviating alcohol-induced liver injury.
},

Here, we first determined whether alcohol by itself or in combination with LPS affects HSF DNA-binding activity and nuclear translocation. In the current study, alcohol treatment for 15 min–24 h represents “short-term or acute” alcohol exposure on the basis of decreased, LPS-induced TNF-α production [4, 6], whereas 72 h alcohol treatment in vitro represents “prolonged or chronic” exposure, determined by increased, LPS-induced TNF-α production, described previously by in vivo and in vitro studies [5, 8].


Treatment of macrophages with physiologically relevant doses (25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM) of alcohol for 15 min significantly increased HSF-binding activity (Fig. 1B). A combination of LPS with alcohol (50 mM and 75 mM) resulted in a further augmentation of HSF DNA binding as indicated in the bar graph (Fig. 1B, lower panel), as compared with LPS or alcohol treatment alone (Fig. 1B).


Heat shock at 42°C for 45 min, used as a positive control, showed the highest HSF-binding activity in monocytes (Fig. 1A) and RAW macrophages (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that HSF-binding activity was induced by short-term alcohol exposure and augmented by a combination of alcohol with LPS in monocytes and macrophages.


These results suggest that alcohol exposure, acute or chronic, induces nuclear translocation of HSF-1 and facilitates DNA binding to influence target gene expression.

Specifically, hsp70 and hsp90 play an important role in regulation of the TLR4-mediated, down-stream signaling pathway, leading to activation of NF-κB [13, 14].


Hsp70 and hsp90 associate with TLR4 in lipid rafts and are essential for LPS recognition [15]. Hsp90 activity is required for constitutive and inducible IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB activation and increased TNF-α production [14]. On the other hand, heat shock-induced hsp70 inhibits intranuclear accumulation of NF-κB and prevents amplification of the inflammatory response [16].


We have shown earlier that acute alcohol exposure impairs NF-κB activation [6], whereas chronic alcohol increases NF-κB-binding activity in primary human monocytes (P. Mandrekar et al., unpublished). Oxidative stress-induced ROS play an important role in induction of TNF-α production by alcohol [7, 21].
},
	annote = {
Specifically, we show that in monocytes and macrophages, short-term alcohol increases HSF-1-binding activity and induces hsp70 mRNA and protein.


In neuronal cells, acute and chronic alcohol exposure induces hsp genes such as hsp70, hsp90, glucose-regulated protein (grp)78, and grp94 via HSF-1 activation [20, 37, 38].


Whereas at first interpreted as a signal of cellular adaptation to stress and protection from the injury, it is now being recognized that hsps and its transcription factor HSF-1 can also contribute to cellular injury [40].


Here, we show that regardless of the duration of exposure, alcohol induces nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of HSF-1.


In human cells, however, HSF-1 and HSF-2 share a common, functional region and are regulated differently. Although HSF-1 is the predominant type activated during stress, HSF-2 plays an important role in early development and also seems to participate in transcriptional regulation of hsps during stress [12, 41]. Our supershift experiments identify HSF-1 and not HSF-2 as the principle form affected by alcohol.


Here, we show that although short-term alcohol alone does not affect hsp70, LPS-induced hsp70 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein are increased in macrophages. Hsp70 induction is regulated by cooperation from other transcription factors such as STAT1, which interacts directly with HSF-1 to induce hsp70 [45].


Although it is likely that a chronic alcohol-mediated decrease in LPS-induced hsp70 could be a result of a lack of cooperation of STAT1, the role of STAT1 in induction of hsp70 by acute alcohol is still unclear.


Here, it is likely that acute alcohol directly increases transcription of hsp70, which in turn could repress TNF-α gene expression. Hsp70 could act via sequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm [43, 44] or direct binding to TNF-α and inhibition of its release [42] in acute alcohol exposure.


Our studies demonstrate that acute alcohol exposure showed no significant differences in total cellular hsp90 but decreased cytoplasmic hsp90 and correlated with HSF-1 activation in these cells.
},
	annote = {
Thus, our results suggest that hsp90 inhibition may prevent the alcohol-induced augmentation of LPS-induced NF-κB-binding activity and TNF-α and subsequently reduce inflammation in ALD. Hence, we propose that hsp90 plays an important role in alcohol-induced inflammation.

After primary culture, cortical astrocytes were moved into a closed anaerobic chamber and incubated in glucose-free culture media. 4 h later, the cells were restored to normoxic conditions and supplied with glucose for 20 h. The ability of agmatine to rescue astrocytes from OGD only and OGD followed by restoration (OGD-R) was assessed. Cell viability was monitored with or without 100 muM agmatine, using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and annexin V flow cytometric assay. For morphological analysis, Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide double nuclear staining was performed. Expression and phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family proteins were also investigated by immunoblotting. Results showed that astrocytes had decreased viability following OGD and OGD-R and that agmatine treatment increased cell viability and induced NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus. Finally, our studies revealed that agmatine can rescue astrocytes from death caused by ischemic and/or ischemic-perfusion neuronal injuries in vitro. Our findings provide new insights that may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce these kinds of neuronal injuries.},

Over accumulation of iron and a loss in taurine in hepatic tissue was observed in fibrotic animals.

Adaptive induction of activities of Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) and aniline hydroxylase accompanied by the reduction in glutathione-S-transferase, DT-diaphorase and glyoxalases I and II was observed. Taurine administration (2\% in drinking water) ameliorated the effects of ethanol and iron. Hepatic damage and fibrosis were reduced in taurine-supplemented rats.

Although agmatine is known to bind to α-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors, it has been suggested that some of the pharmacological actions of agmatine, such as the prevention of morphine tolerance, may be due to the inhibition of nNOS. In the current study, we have discovered that agmatine, at concentrations much lower than the reported K i value, leads to a time-, concentration-, NADPH-, and calmodulin-dependent irreversible inactivation of nNOS. The kinetics of inactivation could be described by an apparent dissociation constant for the initial reversible complex (K i) and a pseudo first-order inactivation constant (k inact) of 29 μM and 0.01 min−1, respectively. As determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, the mechanism of inactivation involves alteration of the prosthetic heme moiety of nNOS, in part to protein-bound products. Moreover, we discovered that agmatine causes a 3-fold increase in the NADPH oxidase activity of nNOS leading to the production of H2O2 and is a likely cause for the inactivation of the enzyme. Both the inactivation of nNOS and the oxidative stress produced should now be considered in the pharmacological actions of agmatine as well as provide insight into the potential biological effects of endogenously formed agmatine.},

Furthermore, the energetic benefit of aerogel glazing is quantified. In evacuated aerogel glazing the space between the glass panes is filled with monolithic silica aerogel evacuated to a rough vacuum of approximately 1-10 hPa. The aerogel glazing does not depend on use of low emissive coatings that have the drawback of absorbing a relatively large part of the solar radiation that otherwise could reduce the space heating demand in residential buildings. The U-value of the glazing can be designed to meet the required value by increasing the monolithic silica aerogel thickness without the need for additional layers of glass. An aerogel glazing with 20 mm glass distance can reach a U-value below 0.5 W/(m2 K) combined with a solar energy transmittance above 0.75. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A comparison of the changes in the concentration of glutamine [Gln] in skeletal muscle in a variety of catabolic states with the attendant changes in rates of protein synthesis and degradation indicates a number of substantial correlations which provide insight into both the way in which [Gln] is regulated in muscle and possible regulatory influences of [Gln] on protein balance. There is a striking direct correlation between [Gln] and the rate of protein synthesis in the whole data set. Further examination of this relationship in protein deficiency shows that the changes in [Gln] correlate mainly with the reductions in ribosomal concentration (RNA/protein) and with the decrease in the rate of protein degradation. Because the fall in [Gln] in protein deficiency is also correlated with the decrease in free T3 concentrations, it is suggested that in this case the correlations of [Gln] with rates of protein turnover may be incidental, reflecting thyroidal influences on both protein turnover and glutamine transport. In contrast, in endotoxemia the changes in [Gln] were highly correlated with the ribosomal activity, kRNA, and in this case [Gln] was inversely correlated with the rate of protein degradation. Similar correlated changes occur in starvation and in response to glucocorticoids, and it is suggested that the reductions in [Gln] in endotoxemia could be causally related to the development of insulin resistance and the inhibition of the translational phase of protein synthesis which occurs in these circumstances. The mechanism of the reduction in [Gln] and any linked inhibition of protein synthesis is unknown, but it is shown to be independent of prostaglandin production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Free radicals reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are generated by our body by various endogenous systems, exposure to different physiochemical conditions or pathological states. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is necessary for proper physiological function. If free radicals overwhelm the body's ability to regulate them, a condition known as oxidative stress ensues. Free radicals thus adversely alter lipids, proteins, and DNA and trigger a number of human diseases. Hence application of external source of antioxidants can assist in coping this oxidative stress. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole have recently been reported to be dangerous for human health. Thus, the search for effective, nontoxic natural compounds with antioxidative activity has been intensified in recent years. The present review provides a brief overview on oxidative stress mediated cellular damages and role of dietary antioxidants as functional foods in the management of human diseases.},

We hypothesized that glutamine supplementation would attenuate the exercise-induced decrease in plasma glutamine concentration and, thus, further enhance levels of plasma IL-6. Eight healthy men participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which they performed 2 h of cycle ergometry at 75\% of peak O2 uptake. They received glutamine, glutamine-rich protein, or placebo supplementation at intervals during and 2 h after exercise. Exercise induced an 11-fold increase in plasma IL-6, which was further enhanced by glutamine (18-fold) and glutamine-rich protein (14-fold) supplementation, administered at doses that attenuated the exercise-induced decrease in plasma glutamine concentration.},

	abstract = {Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in red wine, has wide spectrum of pharmacological properties including antioxidative and antiaging activities. Beta amyloid peptides (Aβ) are known to involve cognitive impairment, neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of cAMP and/or cGMP activities can improve memory performance and decrease the neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, it remains unknown whether the memory enhancing effect of resveratrol on AD associated cognitive disorders is related to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and subsequent increases in intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP activities. This study investigated the effect of resveratrol on Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairment and the participation of PDE4 subtypes related cAMP or cGMP signaling. Mice microinfused with Aβ1-42 into bilateral CA1 subregions displayed learning and memory impairment, as evidenced by reduced memory acquisition and retrieval in the water maze and retention in the passive avoidance tasks; it was also significant that neuroinflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors were increased in Aβ1-42-treated mice. Aβ1-42-treated mice also increased in PDE4A, 4B and 4D expression, and decreased in PKA level. However, PKA inhibitor H89, but not PKG inhibitor KT5823, prevented resveratrol's effects on these parameters. Resveratrol also reversed Aβ1-42-induced decreases in phosphorylated cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic factor BCl-2 expression, which were reversed by H89. These findings suggest that resveratrol reversing Aβ-induced learning and memory disorder may involve the regulation of neuronal inflammation and apoptosis via PDE4 subtypes related cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate intake of different alcoholic beverages on these markers, including carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), sialic acid (SA), and the liver enzymes γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Methods:  Eleven apparently healthy, nonsmoking middle-aged men were included in a 12-week randomized, diet-controlled crossover trial according to a 4 × 4 Latin-square design. Changes in CDT, SA, γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were analyzed after 3 weeks of daily intake of four glasses (40 g of alcohol) of red wine, beer, spirits (Dutch gin), or water (control). Results:  After 3 weeks’ daily consumption of red wine, a significant decrease of serum CDT concentration was observed compared with water consumption. There was no effect of any alcoholic beverage on the other outcome measures. Conclusions:  Daily consumption of 40 g of alcohol from different types of alcoholic beverages with dinner did not affect SA or liver enzymes. Further investigations to explore the mechanisms for the red wine–induced decreases of CDT, including changes in iron metabolism, are clearly needed.},

	abstract = {Chronic alcohol use can result in many pathological effects including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). While alcohol is necessary for the development of ALD, only 20–30\% of alcoholics develop alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) with progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis and liver failure (ALD). This suggests that while chronic alcohol consumption is necessary it is not sufficient to induce clinically relevant liver damage in the absence of a secondary risk factor. Studies in rodent models and alcoholic patients show that increased intestinal permeability to microbial products like endotoxin play a critical role in promoting liver inflammation in ALD pathogenesis. Therefore identifying mechanisms of alcohol-induced intestinal permeability is important in identifying mechanisms of ALD and for designing new avenues for therapy. Cyp2e1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes alcohol has been shown to be upregulated by chronic alcohol use and to be a major source of oxidative stress and liver injury in alcoholics and in animal and in vitro models of chronic alcohol use. Because Cyp2e1 is also expressed in the intestine and is upregulated by chronic alcohol use, we hypothesized it could play a role in alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability. Our in vitro studies with intestinal Caco-2 cells and in mice fed alcohol showed that circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2 are required for alcohol-induced permeability. We also showed that alcohol increases Cyp2e1 protein and activity but not mRNA in Caco-2 cells and that an inhibitor of oxidative stress or siRNA knockdown of Cyp2e1 prevents the increase in CLOCK or PER2 proteins and prevents alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. With our collaborators we have also shown that Cyp2e1 knockout mice are resistant to alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver inflammation. Taken together our data support a novel Cyp2e1-circadian clock protein mechanism for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new avenues for therapy of ALD.},

Alcohol universally promotes increased permeability in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro; however, alcohol consumption induces intestinal hyperpermeability and endotoxemia in only a subset of human alcoholics [21] and [22].

Cyp2e1-mediated alcohol metabolism results in the production of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress) and other damaging products [43], [44] and [45]. Thus, Cyp2e1-mediated products of alcohol could be the key mechanism of alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver injury.

Our studies show that the anti-oxidant NAC prevents the alcohol–Cyp2e1 mediated increase in CLOCK and PER2 that in turn promotes intestinal hyperpermeability [46] and [47].


Thus, antioxidants or Cyp2e1 inhibitors might therefore be used to reduce alcohol induced gut leakiness therapeutically. A second possible therapy is the use of prebiotics such as oats or probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG because we have shown that both pre- and probiotics ameliorate intestinal oxidative stress and gut leakiness in alcohol-fed rodents


A third possible therapeutic avenue suggested by our data are greater attention to normalizing circadian disruption in the lifestyle of chronic alcohol users.

Several recent studies have shown that alcohol and/or alcohol metabolism products such as acetaldehyde [25] (produced as a by-product of alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH) or stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [26], [27] and [28] disrupt intestinal barrier integrity via several mechanisms especially alterations in tight junction proteins [29], [30] and [31]. Intestinal epithelial tight junctions are the major regulators of intestinal permeability [32] and [33] thus altering tight junction protein expression and/or function will certainly impact intestinal barrier function.


However, ADH-induced effects on tight junction proteins are unlikely to fully explain alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability since Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, a widely used cell line for alcohol studies [23], do not express ADH [34] and yet low dose (0.2\%) alcohol exposure results in marked disruption of Caco-2 cell monolayer barrier function [26] and [35].

Therefore we propose that the degree of circadian disruption in an individual patient may be one critical difference that makes that subject more susceptible to alcohol-induced gut leakiness.


One reason for this variability for example could be individual variability in the ‘anti-oxidant capacity’ (redox state) of intestinal cells/tissue from a given individual due to diet, stress, or other factors. Another possibility very relevant to this review could be differences in individual expression of intestinal and/or liver Cyp2e1. Finally, there is the element of the effects of microbiota dysbiosis on gut leakiness.

They showed that small intestine and colonic Cyp2e1 is induced by alcohol with individual variability in humans which may be contributing to the subset of individuals that demonstrate alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability and liver pathology [36].

Thus, alcohol-induced circadian rhythm disruption in the intestine and/or liver may account for alcohol effects on intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver pathology. One mechanism accounting for alcohol-induced effects on the molecular circadian clock may be oxidative stress [73] and [74] as the molecular circadian clock has several elements that are redox sensitive.


Thus, at a time when monolayers are exhibiting alcohol-induced hyperpermeability, the levels of these molecular circadian clock proteins are abnormally elevated.


Thus, both the Caco-2 and in vivo data support that alcohol stimulation of the circadian clock protein PER2 occurs at a time when intestinal permeability is elevated and may be an important factor in alcohol-induced gut leakiness.
},
	annote = {
To determine the relative contribution of oxidative stress in these effects, Caco-2 cells were pretreated with the anti-oxidantN-acetylcysteine (NAC), which blocked the alcohol-induced increase in CLOCK and PER2 proteins as well as intestinal hyperpermeability.


Experiments with red blood cells show that redox state alone in the absence of transcription can regulate circadian rhythms [91] and cyanobacteria [92].

Serum alanine aminotransferase activity, TNFalpha level, and hepatic malondialdehyde level were increased significantly by ethanol administration. Hepatic Cyp2e1 was induced to 250\% of control. Ethanol administration decreased hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and glutathione, but elevated hypotaurine and taurine levels. Betaine supplied in drinking water for 2 weeks attenuated the induction of alcoholic liver injury and Cyp2e1 significantly. Reduction of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and glutathione was alleviated, and elevation of hypotaurine and taurine was depressed.

We have previously shown that the HCR strain have elevated hepatic mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity. In this study, we tested if the elevated hepatic mitochondrial content in the HCR rat would provide “metabolic protection” from chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and injury. The Leiber-Decarli liquid diet with ethanol (7\% v/v; HCR-E) and without (HCR-C) was given to HCR rats (n = 8 per group) from 14 to 20 weeks of age that were weight matched and pair-fed to assure isocaloric intake. Hepatic triglyceride (TG) content and macro- and microvesicular steatosis were significantly greater in HCR-E compared with HCR-C (p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, hepatic superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced in the HCR-E rats. This hepatic phenotype also was associated with reduced total hepatic fatty acid oxidation (p = 0.03) and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (p = 0.01), and reductions in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apoB-100 protein content (p = 0.01) in HCR-E animals. However, despite these documented hepatic alterations, ethanol ingestion failed to induce significant hepatic liver injury, including no changes in hepatic inflammation, or serum alanine amino transferase (ALTs), free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides (TGs), insulin, or glucose. High intrinsic aerobic fitness did not reduce ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis, but protected against ethanol-induced hepatic injury and systemic metabolic dysfunction in a high aerobic capacity rat model.},

The purpose of this study was to explore the presence and severity of hangover symptoms, and determine their interrelationship. Methods: A survey was conducted among n = 1410 Dutch students examining their drinking behavior and latest alcohol hangover. The severity of 47 presumed hangover symptoms were scored on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (maximal). Factor analysis was conducted to summarize the data into groups of associated symptoms that contribute significantly to the alcohol hangover and symptoms that do not. Results: About half of the participants (56.1\%, n = 791) reported having had a hangover during the past month. Most commonly reported and most severe hangover symptoms were fatigue (95.5\%) and thirst (89.1\%). Factor analysis revealed 11 factors that together account for 62\% of variance. The most prominent factor ‘drowsiness’ (explained variance 28.8\%) included symptoms such as drowsiness, fatigue, sleepiness and weakness. The second factor ‘cognitive problems’ (explained variance 5.9\%) included symptoms such as reduced alertness, memory and concentration problems. Other factors, including the factor ‘disturbed water balance’ comprising frequently reported symptoms such as ‘dry mouth’ and ‘thirst’, contributed much less to the overall hangover (explained variance {\textless}5\%).

	abstract = {Gene variants encoding several of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), are among the largest genetic associations with risk for alcohol dependence. Certain genetic variants (i.e., alleles)—particularly the ADH1B*2, ADH1B*3, ADH1C*1, and ALDH2*2 alleles—have been associated with lower rates of alcohol dependence. These alleles may lead to an accumulation of acetaldehyde during alcohol metabolism, which can result in heightened subjective and objective effects. The prevalence of these alleles differs among ethnic groups; ADH1B*2 is found frequently in northeast Asians and occasionally Caucasians, ADH1B*3 is found predominantly in people of African ancestry, ADH1C*1 varies substantially across populations, and ALDH2*2 is found almost exclusively in northeast Asians. Differences in the prevalence of these alleles may account at least in part for ethnic differences in alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, these alleles do not act in isolation to influence the risk of AUD. For example, the gene effects of ALDH2*2 and ADH1B*2 seem to interact. Moreover, other factors have been found to influence the extent to which these alleles affect a person’s alcohol involvement, including developmental stage, individual characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, antisocial behavior, and behavioral undercontrol), and environmental factors (e.g., culture, religion, family environment, and childhood adversity).},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggested mitophagy activation mitigates ethanol-induced liver injury. However, the effect of ethanol on mitophagy is inconsistent. Importantly, the understanding of mitophagy status after chronic ethanol consumption is limited. This study evaluated the effect of quercetin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid, on chronic ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage focused on mitophagy. An ethanol regime to mice for 15 weeks (accounting for 30\% of total calories) led to significant mitochondrial damage as evidenced by changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and remodeling of membrane lipid composition, which was greatly attenuated by quercetin (100 mg/kg.bw). Moreover, quercetin blocked chronic ethanol-induced mitophagy suppression as denoted by mitophagosomes-lysosome fusion and mitophagy-related regulator elements, including LC3II, Parkin, p62 and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), paralleling with increased FoxO3a nuclear translocation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), instead of AKT and Sirtuin 1, were involved in quercetin-mediated mitophagy activation. Quercetin alleviated ethanol-elicited mitochondrial damage through enhancing mitophagy, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for alcoholic liver disease.},

Furthermore, substantial collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in response to ethanol stress was observed in mice liver.


In the current study, chronic ethanol overload caused various degenerative changes of liver histology, particularly on mitochondria with abnormal shape, swelling, lacking cristae, destructing inner membranes and autolysis.


Most importantly, we further found that ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage and dysfunction were intimately related to the remodeling of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids with an enhanced amount of C18:1 and decreased content of C16:0.


This apparent discrepancy suggested that extending ethanol exposure time could further upregulate de novo lipogenesis and subsequent acyl chain elongation and desaturation within the mice liver.


Notably, our data revealed for the first time that ethanol led to increased levels of C18:2 and C18:3 and reduced concentrations of C22:5 and C22:6 in mitochondrial phospholipids, due to inhibited Δ-5 or Δ-6 desaturase activities in liver after ethanol treatment [28].


Quercetin supplementation greatly reversed ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage evidenced by decreased accumulation of damaged mitochondria and improved mitochondrial morphology and membrane properties.


Therefore, the increased accumulation of DHA within mitochondrial membrane mediated by quercetin may affect the function of mitochondrial outer membrane protein and benefit the removal of damaged mitochondria.

	abstract = {An athlete's carbohydrate intake can be judged by whether total daily intake and the timing of consumption in relation to exercise maintain adequate carbohydrate substrate for the muscle and central nervous system ("high carbohydrate availability") or whether carbohydrate fuel sources are limiting for the daily exercise programme ("low carbohydrate availability"). Carbohydrate availability is increased by consuming carbohydrate in the hours or days prior to the session, intake during exercise, and refuelling during recovery between sessions. This is important for the competition setting or for high-intensity training where optimal performance is desired. Carbohydrate intake during exercise should be scaled according to the characteristics of the event. During sustained high-intensity sports lasting ∼1 h, small amounts of carbohydrate, including even mouth-rinsing, enhance performance via central nervous system effects. While 30-60 g · h(-1) is an appropriate target for sports of longer duration, events {\textbackslash}textgreater2.5 h may benefit from higher intakes of up to 90 g · h(-1). Products containing special blends of different carbohydrates may maximize absorption of carbohydrate at such high rates. In real life, athletes undertake training sessions with varying carbohydrate availability. Whether implementing additional "train-low" strategies to increase the training adaptation leads to enhanced performance in well-trained individuals is unclear.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity-associated inflammation is characterized by an increased abundance of macrophages (MΦs) in white adipose tissue (WAT), leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins (PGs) that can cause insulin resistance. Grape powder extract (GPE) is rich in phenolic phytochemicals that possess anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
Objective: We examined the ability of GPE to prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation in human MΦs and silence the cross-talk between human MΦs and adipocytes.
Design: We investigated the effect of GPE pretreatment on LPS-mediated activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and induction of inflammatory genes in human MΦs (that is, differentiated U937 cells). In addition, we determined the effect of GPE pretreatment of MΦs on inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes incubated with LPS-challenged MΦ-conditioned medium (MΦ-CM).
Methods and Results: Pretreatment of MΦs with GPE attenuated LPS-induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β; chemokines, such as IL-8 and interferon-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10); and a marker of PG production, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Grape powder extract also attenuated LPS activation of MAPKs, NF-κB and AP-1 (c-Jun), as evidenced by decreased (1) phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38; (2) degradation of IκBα and activation of an NF-κB reporter construct; and (3) phosphorylation of c-Jun and Elk-1. Using LPS-challenged MΦ-CM, GPE pretreatment attenuated MΦ-mediated inflammatory gene expression, activation of an NF-κB reporter and suppression of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in human adipocytes.
Conclusion: Collectively, these data demonstrate that GPE attenuates LPS-mediated inflammation in MΦs, possibly by decreasing the activation of MAPKs, NF-κB and AP-1, and that GPE decreases the capacity of LPS-stimulated MΦs to inflame adipocytes and cause insulin resistance.},

Therefore, we tested its influence against cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats using Morris water maze and object recognition paradigm. Lipid peroxidation and glutathione levels as parameters of oxidative stress and choline esterase (ChE) activity as a marker of cholinergic function were assessed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Thirty days after diabetes induction rats showed a severe deficit in learning and memory associated with increased lipid peroxidation, decreased reduced glutathione, and elevated ChE activity. In contrast, chronic treatment with agmatine (5-10mg/kg, i.p. for 30 days) improved cognitive performance, lowered hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and ChE activity in diabetic rats. Further, memory improving effects of agmatine were independent of adrenal I(2) imidazoline receptors. In a separate set, agmatine treatment for an initial 15 days after diabetes confirmation also significantly reduced memory impairment during training trials after 30 days of diabetes confirmation. Moreover, treatment during training trials (30 days after diabetes) also significantly reduced memory impairment in diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that treatment with agmatine prevents changes in oxidative stress and ChE activity, and probably consequent memory impairment in diabetic rats.},

	abstract = {Agmatine (CAS 2482-00-0), an amine formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine, interacts with several targets like alpha2-adrenergic, imidazoline and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and besides it is involved in the nitric oxide mediated effects. It has also been proposed that it possesses vasodilator effects and increases glomerular filtration rate in rats. The aim of this study was to supply evidence for the effects of agmatine in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock and explain the possible mechanisms of action. The iliac arteries and veins of Sprague-Dawley rats were catheterized under urethane anesthesia and around 2 ml/100 g blood was withdrawn within 20 min until the mean arterial blood pressure was stabilized around 25 mmHg. The rats were either pretreated with physiological saline, yohimbine (an alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or L-arginine (a nitric oxide donor) intravenously before administration of agmatine (300 microg/kg). Agmatine restored blood pressure in rats pretreated with physiological saline where all rats survived. Pretreatment with L-arginine abolished the increase in blood pressure produced by agmatine and the 1 h survival rate decreased to 67\% (p {\textless} 0.01). Yohimbine pretreatment also suppressed agmatine induced restoration of blood pressure; however, the survival rate was found to be 17\% for 3 min. No statistically significant effect was observed in the heart rate responses. These results may suggest that agmatine may increase survival through alpha2-adrenergic receptors and restores blood pressure through nitric oxide and adrenergic mechanisms in rats bled to hemorrhage.},

	abstract = {The studies presented here demonstrate the protective effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) against alcohol-induced oxidative neuroinflammation, neuronal degeneration, and impaired neurotransmission. Our findings reveal the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of alcohol-induced oxidative damage in various types of brain cells. Chronic ethanol administration to mice caused an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 3-nitrotyrosine adduct formation in frontal cortical neurons but not in astrocytes from brains of these animals. Interestingly, alcohol administration caused a rather selective activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), which, in turn, enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxynonenal, but these were predominantly localized in astrocytes and microglia. Oxidative damage in glial cells was accompanied by their pronounced activation (astrogliosis) and coincident neuronal loss, suggesting that inflammation in glial cells caused neuronal degeneration. Immunohistochemistry studies indicated that alcohol consumption induced different oxidative mediators in different brain cell types. Thus, nitric oxide was mostly detected in iNOS-expressing neurons, whereas ROS were predominantly generated in NOX-expressing glial cells after alcohol ingestion. Assessment of neuronal activity in ex vivo frontal cortical brain tissue slices from ethanol-fed mice showed a reduction in long-term potentiation synaptic transmission compared with slices from controls. Coadministration of ALC with alcohol showed a significant reduction in oxidative damage and neuronal loss and a restoration of synaptic neurotransmission in this brain region, suggesting that ALC protects brain cells from ethanol-induced oxidative injury. These findings suggest the potential clinical utility of ALC as a neuroprotective agent that prevents alcohol-induced brain damage and development of neurological disorders.},

(Rump et al 2010:1500)"Thus, our findings indicate that ALC neutralizes oxidative damage in the brain caused by chronic ethanol administration." (Rump et al 2010:1500)"This concentration is considered a high ethanol dose in mice. Blood alcohol levels were 10.6-17.6 mM (0.05-0.1\%)." (Rump et al 2010:1500)"The significance of the present findings is that chronic alcohol feeding activated ROSand RNS-generating pathways in specific brain cell types." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"We noted that timely administration of ALC significantly stabilized the long-term synaptic neurotransmission of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons by preventing the activation of iNOS, NOX, and glial cells." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"These findings indicate that chronic alcohol ingestion preferentially modulates iNOS protein level in neurons but not in astrocytes or microglia, validating our recent findings that EtOH/Ach exposure increased the level of iNOS protein in cultured primary human neurons [17]." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"We conclude that iNOS induction led to accumulation of NO and peroxynitrite formation thereby promoting the transduction of oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration during chronic ethanol consumption." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"This implies that NO generated by neurons diffuses into glial cells and reacts with superoxide to form highly reactive peroxynitrite." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"Most importantly, ALC significantly minimized the level of alcohol-induced iNOS/nitrotyrosine adduct formation in neurons and further prevented NOX protein induction in astrocytes and microglia, thereby preventing gliosis in the frontal cortex." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"Thus, we postulate that ALC exerts its antioxidant property by indirect mechanisms such as its ability to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential transition." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"One possible mechanism by which ALC could act is by suppressing the activation of free radical-generating pathways such as iNOS and NOX as indicated by the present findings." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"Another plausible mechanism for ALC to circumvent the excessive level of oxidative stress is to stabilize the naturally occurring biological antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants such as SOD, catalase, or the intracellular levels of glutathione." (Rump et al 2010:1501)"Such was the case in this study, that the numbers of microglia in alcoholic brain were higher than those in mice given ALC plus alcohol or in the pair-fed controls" (Rump et al 2010:1502)"This finding suggested that, although ALC provided neuroprotection, it was unable to inhibit the sensitivity to chronic alcohol insult completely." (Rump et al 2010:1502)"In particular, the ability of ALC to prevent alcohol-induced mitochondrial damage, energy depletion due to defective respiratory chain complexes, oxidative-mediated neuroinflammation, and neuronal degeneration will be of significant importance in further investigations." (Rump et al 2010:1502)"Indeed, during chronic alcohol consumption, ALC sustained the neuronal LFS and LTP synaptic transmission by preserving the integrity of neurofilaments and by maintaining dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons." (Rump et al 2010:1502)"These findings lead us to suggest that ALC regulates the activation of the acetylcholine receptor, as the acetyl group is an essential precursor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine." (Rump et al 2010:1502)"we propose that daily use of dietary ALC (1-2 mg/kg body wt) by alcohol abusers could provide a potential health benefit." (Rump et al 2010:1502)},

In this study, we investigated the effect of carnosine pretreatment on ethanol-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity.

All rats were killed 6 hours after last ethanol injection. Plasma alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) transaminase activities and liver triglyceride, malondialdehyde (MDA), diene conjugate (DC), glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and vitamin C levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities were determined. Binge ethanol administration resulted in significant increases in plasma transaminase activities, hepatic triglyceride and lipid peroxide levels. However, GSH, vitamin E, vitamin C levels and GSH-Px and GST activities were found to be decreased following ethanol administration. Macromicrovesicular steatosis was also seen. Carnosine pretreatment appeared to prevent the increase of plasma ALT and AST activities and hepatic MDA and DC levels following ethanol treatment. In addition, hepatic GSH levels increased, but there were no changes in triglyceride, vitamin E, vitamin C levels and SOD, GSH-Px and GST activities, following ethanol treatment in carnosine-pretreated rats. There was also no change in liver histopathological appearance. In conclusion, carnosine prevented the increases in serum transaminase activities and lipid peroxides in liver of ethanol-treated rats, without any change on steatosis in liver.},

	abstract = {Background
This study was designed to investigate the effect of a herbal mixture extract (DTS20) on the attenuation of oxidative stress and hangover after alcohol consumption in healthy volunteers.

Methods
DTS20 consists of Viscum album L. (40\%), Lycium chinense L. (30\%), Inonotus obliquus (20\%), and Acanthopanax senticosus H. (10\%). We recruited healthy, nonsmoking, adult men volunteers aged between 21 years and 30 years to participate in a crossover trial. Twenty participants received either one package of placebo with 200 mL water or DTS20 with 200 mL water. Thirty minutes later, the volunteers ingested one bottle of Soju, which is a commercially available liquor (19\% alcohol in 360 mL).

Results
Volunteers received the opposite treatment after a 1-week washout period. DTS20 is mainly composed of sugars (564.5 mg/g) and polyphenol (28.2 mg/g). Alcohol levels in the DTS20 group were significantly lower than the control group at 2 hours after drinking Soju (p {\textless} 0.05). Acetaldehyde levels in the DTS20 group tended to be lower than the control group at 2 hours after drinking Soju, but was not significantly different. The antioxidant activity level was also significantly different between the control and DTS20 group 2 hours after drinking Soju (p {\textless} 0.05). No differences in plasma alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels were observed between plasma levels before drinking and 2 hours after drinking Soju in the control group.

Conclusion
It was concluded that DTS20 reduced oxidative stress and hangover by mitigating plasma alcohol concentrations and elevating antioxidative activity in healthy male adults.},

Our results show that addition of glutamine to culture medium significantly improved the disruption of integrity caused by ethanol, which was associated with increased expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Ethanol exposure moderately activates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which was characterized by increased DNA-binding activity and phosphorylation status of HSF1. Remarkably, glutamine treatment enhanced ethanol-mediated expression of Hsp70 and activation of HSF1. Up-regulation of Hsp70 by pretreatment with heat stress also promoted recovery from the ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction. Taken together, these observations indicate that glutamine protects the intestinal barrier function in Caco-2 cells, in part by modulating HSF1-mediated Hsp70 expression.},

Components of the circadian clock have been shown to influence the pathophysiological effects of alcohol. Conversely, alcohol may alter the expression of circadian clock genes and the rhythmic behavioral and metabolic processes they regulate. Therefore, we propose that alcohol-mediated disruption in circadian rhythms likely underpins many adverse health effects of alcohol that cut across multiple organ systems. In this review, we provide an overview of the circadian clock mechanism and showcase results from new studies in the alcohol field implicating the circadian clock as a key target of alcohol action and toxicity in the liver. We discuss various molecular events through which alcohol may work to negatively impact circadian clock-mediated processes in the liver, and contribute to tissue pathology. Illuminating the mechanistic connections between the circadian clock and alcohol will be critical to the development of new preventative and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorders and alcohol-mediated organ diseases.},

	abstract = {Oxidative damage of the endothelium disrupts the integrity of blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown before that alcohol exposure increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS, superoxide and hydroxyl radical) and nitric oxide (NO) in brain endothelial cells by activating NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase. We hypothesize that impairment of anti-oxidant systems like reduction of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in ethanol exposure may elevate the levels of ROS/NO in endothelium resulting in BBB damage. The present study examines whether stabilization of antioxidant enzyme activity results in suppression of ROS levels by anti-inflammatory agents. To address this idea, we determined the effects of ethanol on the kinetic profile of SOD and catalase activity and ROS/NO generation in primary human brain endothelial cells (hBECs). We observed an enhanced production of ROS and NO levels due to the metabolism of ethanol in hBECs. Similar increases were found after exposure of hBECs to acetaldehyde, the major metabolite of ethanol. Ethanol simultaneously augmented ROS generation and activity of anti-oxidative enzymes. SOD activity was increased for a much longer period of time as compared to catalase activity. Decline in SOD activity and protein levels preceded elevation of oxidant levels. SOD stabilization by the mitochondria protecting agent, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), and anti-inflammatory agent, rosiglitazone, suppressed ROS levels with marginal increase in NO levels. Mitochondrial membrane protein damage and decreased membrane potential after ethanol exposure indicated mitochondrial injury. These changes were prevented by ALC. Our findings suggest the counteracting mechanisms of oxidants and anti-oxidants during alcohol-induced oxidative stress at the BBB. The presence of enzymatic stabilizers favors the ROS neutralizing anti-oxidant redox of the BBB, suggesting an underlying protective mechanism of NO for brain vascular tone and vasodilation.},

This research was conducted to establish how bromocriptine, haloperidol and azithromycin, applied to the experimental model, affected the antioxidative status of the liver. The following parameters were determined: reduced glutathione, activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase, catalase, xanthine oxidase and lipid peroxidation intensity. Alanine transaminase was measured in serum. Alcohol stress (AO group) reduced glutathione and the activity of xanthine oxidase and glutathione peroxidase, but increased catalase and alanine transaminase activity. The best protective effect was achieved with the bromocriptine (AB1 group), while other groups had similar effects on the studied parameters.},

	abstract = {Background: Resistant starch sources, which are only partially digested in the small intestine, can be used to increase colonic availability of short-chain fatty acids.
Objective: To study the characteristics of the fermentation of resistant starch, the digestion of resistant starch in the small intestine has to be quantified. We compared the metabolic fates of highly digestible cornstarch (DCS), Hylon VII (type 2 resistant starch), and Novelose 330 (type 3 resistant starch), which are of corn origin and, therefore, naturally enriched in 13C.
Design: After administration of 40 g starch or glucose to 7 healthy volunteers, glucose and exogenous glucose concentrations in serum and 13CO2 excretion in breath were analyzed for 6 h. 13C abundance in carbon dioxide was analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and 13C abundance in glucose by gas chromatography–combustion IRMS.
Results: By comparing the area under the curve (2 h) of exogenous glucose concentration in serum (13C glycemic index) after intake of starch or glucose, 13C glycemic indexes for DCS, Hylon VII, and Novelose 330 were calculated to be 82 ± 23\%, 44 ± 16\%, and 43 ± 15\%, respectively. Comparison of 6-h cumulative percentage dose recovery in breath showed that 119 ± 28\% of DCS, 55 ± 23\% of Hylon VII, and 50 ± 26\% of Novelose 330 was digested in the small intestine.
Conclusion: The exogenous glucose response in serum and the 13CO2 excretion in breath can be used to estimate small intestinal digestion of resistant starch, which amounts to ≈50\%.},

Furthermore, recent and ongoing studies address the impact of digestion-resistant starches on the prevention and control of chronic human diseases, including diabetes, colon cancer, and obesity. This review provides a transdisciplinary overview of this field, including a description of types of resistant starches; factors in plants that affect digestion resistance; methods for starch analysis; challenges in developing food products with resistant starches; mammalian intestinal and gut bacterial metabolism; potential effects on gut microbiota; and impacts and mechanisms for the prevention and control of colon cancer, diabetes, and obesity.

	abstract = {Purpose
Evidence shows that alcohol intake causes oxidative neuronal injury and neurocognitive deficits that are distinct from the classical Wernicke-Korsakoff neuropathy. Our previous findings indicated that alcohol-elicited blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage leads to neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. The dynamic function of the BBB requires a constant supply and utilization of glucose. Here we examined whether interference of glucose uptake and transport at the endothelium by alcohol leads to BBB dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.

Material and methods
We tested the hypothesis in cell culture of human brain endothelial cells, neurons and alcohol intake in animal by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and glucose uptake assay methods.

Results
We found that decrease in glucose uptake correlates the reduction of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) in cell culture after 50 mM ethanol exposure. Decrease in GLUT1 protein levels was regulated at the translation process. In animal, chronic alcohol intake suppresses the transport of glucose into the frontal and occipital regions of the brain. This finding is validated by a marked decrease in GLUT1 protein expression in brain microvessel (the BBB). In parallel, alcohol intake impairs the BBB tight junction proteins occludin, zonula occludens-1, and claudin-5 in the brain microvessel. Permeability of sodium fluorescein and Evans Blue confirms the leakiness of the BBB. Further, depletion of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of the cell monolayer supports the disruption of BBB integrity. Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine (a neuroprotective agent) significantly prevents the adverse effects of alcohol on glucose uptake, BBB damage and neuronal degeneration.

Conclusion
These findings suggest that alcohol-elicited inhibition of glucose transport at the blood-brain interface leads to BBB malfunction and neurological complications.},

	abstract = {Abstract:  In mammals, the carnitine pool consists of nonesterified l-carnitine and many acylcarnitine esters. Of these esters, acetyl-l-carnitine is quantitatively and functionally the most significant. Carnitine homeostasis is maintained by absorption from diet, a modest rate of synthesis, and efficient renal reabsorption. Dietary l-carnitine is absorbed by active and passive transfer across enterocyte membranes. Bioavailability of dietary l-carnitine is 54-87\% and is dependent on the amount of l-carnitine in the meal. Absorption of l-carnitine dietary supplements (0.5-6 g) is primarily passive; bioavailability is 14-18\% of dose. Unabsorbed l-carnitine is mostly degraded by microorganisms in the large intestine. Circulating l-carnitine is distributed to two kinetically defined compartments: one large and slow-turnover (presumably muscle), and another relatively small and rapid-turnover (presumably liver, kidney, and other tissues). At normal dietary l-carnitine intake, whole-body turnover time in humans is 38-119 h. In vitro experiments suggest that acetyl-l-carnitine is partially hydrolyzed in enterocytes during absorption. In vivo, circulating acetyl-l-carnitine concentration was increased 43\% after oral acetyl-l-carnitine supplements of 2 g/day, indicating that acetyl-l-carnitine is absorbed at least partially without hydrolysis. After single-dose intravenous administration (0.5 g), acetyl-l-carnitine is rapidly, but not completely hydrolyzed, and acetyl-l-carnitine and l-carnitine concentrations return to baseline within 12 h. At normal circulating l-carnitine concentrations, renal l-carnitine reabsorption is highly efficient (90-99\% of filtered load; clearance, 1-3 mL/min), but displays saturation kinetics. Thus, as circulating l-carnitine concentration increases (as after high-dose intravenous or oral administration of l-carnitine), efficiency of reabsorption decreases and clearance increases, resulting in rapid decline of circulating l-carnitine concentration to baseline. Elimination kinetics for acetyl-l-carnitine are similar to those for l-carnitine. There is evidence for renal tubular secretion of both l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine. Future research should address the correlation of supplement dosage, changes and maintenance of tissue l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine concentrations, and metabolic and functional changes and outcomes.},

Secondary endpoints were the effect of ALC on melancholic and negative symptoms. Sixty-four anhedonic alcohol dependent patients with minor or absent withdrawal symptoms were randomized: 23 received ALC at a dosage of 3g/day, 21 received ALC at a dosage of 1g/day, and 20 were given placebo. ALC was given intravenously for 10days, followed by 80days of oral treatment plus a follow-up period of 45days. The presence of anhedonic symptoms was determined by the SHAPS (Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale) and the VASa (Visual Analogue Scale for Anhedonia); negative and melancholic symptoms were evaluated by the SANS (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and the BRMS (Bech–Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale). The natural course of anhedonia in the placebo group showed a decline until day 30 and remains stable for the rest of the study. Intravenously ALC accelerated the improvement of anhedonia reaching constant low levels early, on day 10. At this step levels of anhedonia (SHAPS, VASa) and melancholic symptoms (BRMES) resulted significantly reduced (p{\textless}0.05) in both the ALC 3g and ALC 1g groups with respect to placebo; SANS scores significantly reduced only in the ALC 1g respect to placebo (p=0.014). During oral treatment with ALC, anhedonia scores did not differ from placebo. Intravenously ALC was effective in accelerating the abstinence-associated improvement of anhedonia, melancholic and negative symptoms, whereas oral ALC treatment starting on day 10 showed no further improvements. Accordingly, in alcohol dependent subjects, ALC may be considered as a new potentially useful drug for the treatment of anhedonia.},

Objective: This study evaluated the effect of exogenous ALC on physical and mental fatigue, fatigue severity, and physical activity in patients with mild and moderate hepatoencephalopathy (HE1 and HE2, respectively).
Design: A total of 121 patients with overt HE were recruited to the study and were subdivided into 2 groups according to their initial HE grade [HE1 (n = 61) or HE2 (n = 60)]. Thirty-one patients with HE1 and 30 with HE2 received 2 g ALC, and 30 patients with HE1 and 30 patients with HE2 received placebo twice a day for 90 d. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessments and automated electroencephalogram analysis.
Results: At the end of the study period, the ALC-treated patients in the HE1 group showed significantly better improvement than did the placebo group in mental fatigue score (−1.7 compared with −0.3; P {\textless} 0.05), the fatigue severity scale (−6.4 compared with 2.3; P {\textless} 0.001), 7-d Physical Activity Recall questionnaire score (17.1 compared with −2.5; P {\textless} 0.001), and Short Physical Performance Battery (2.1 compared with 0.2; P {\textless} 0.001); the HE2 group showed significantly better improvement in the fatigue severity scale (−8.1 compared with −5.1; P {\textless} 0.001) and 6-min walk test (19.9 compared with 2.3; P {\textless} 0.05).

Distinct deficiencies arise either from genetic mutation of carnitine transporters or in association with other disorders such as liver or kidney disease. Carnitine deficiency occurs in aberrations of carnitine regulation in disorders such as diabetes, sepsis, cardiomyopathy, malnutrition, cirrhosis, endocrine disorders and with aging. Nutritional supplementation of L-carnitine, the biologically active form of carnitine, is ameliorative for uremic patients, and can improve nerve conduction, neuropathic pain and immune function in diabetes patients while it is life-saving for patients suffering primary carnitine deficiency. Clinical application of carnitine holds much promise in a range of neural disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, hepatic encephalopathy and other painful neuropathies. Topical application in dry eye offers osmoprotection and modulates immune and inflammatory responses. Carnitine has been recognized as a nutritional supplement in cardiovascular disease and there is increasing evidence that carnitine supplementation may be beneficial in treating obesity, improving glucose intolerance and total energy expenditure.},

	abstract = {L-carnitine has been used as a supplement to treat cardiovascular or liver disease.  However, there has been little information about the effect of L-carnitine on anti-oxidation capability in healthy human subjects.  This study was designed to investigate the correlation between plasma L-carnitine concentration and antioxidant activity.  Liquid L-carnitine (2.0 g) was administered orally as a single dose in 12 healthy subjects.  Plasma concentration of L-carnitine was detected by HPLC.  The baseline concentration of L-carnitine was 39.14 ± 5.65 μmol/L.  After single oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-∞) were 84.7 ± 25.2 μmol/L and 2,676.4 ± 708.3 μmol/L·h, respectively.  The half-life and the time required to reach the Cmax was 60.3 ± 15.0 min and 3.4 ± 0.46 h, respectively.  There was a gradual increase in plasma concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in the first 3.5 h following L-carnitine administration.  The plasma concentrations of SOD, GSH-Px, catalase and T-AOC returned to baseline levels within 24 h.  A positive correlation was found between L-carnitine concentration and the antioxidant index of SOD (r = 0.992, P {\textless} 0.01), GSH-Px (r = 0.932, P {\textless} 0.01), catalase (r = 0.972, P {\textless} 0.01) or T-AOC (r = 0.934, P {\textless} 0.01).  In conclusion, L-carnitine increases activities of antioxidant enzymes and the total antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects.  It may be useful as a supplementary therapy for chronic illnesses involving excessive oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Carnitine (4-N-trimethylammonium-3-hydroxybutyric acid), a compound necessary for a transfer of fatty acids for their oxidation within the cell, accumulates in brain although β-oxidation of fatty acids is very low in neurons. Carnitine accumulates to lower extent in the brain than in peripheral tissues and the mechanism of its transport through the blood–brain barrier is discussed, with the involvement of two transporters, OCTN2 and B0,+ being presented. A limitation by the blood–brain barrier of carnitine supply for the brain and the mechanism of its transport to neural cells by a protein belonging to neurotransmitters' transporters superfamily is further discussed. Due to the beneficial effects of administration of acetylcarnitine in case of patients with dementia, the role of this acylcarnitine is presented in the context of neuronal cell metabolism and the role of acetylcarnitine in the synthesis of acetylcholine. The roles of long-chain acyl derivatives of carnitine, in particular palmitoylcarnitine, responsible for interaction with the membranes, lipids acylation and specific interactions with proteins have been summarized. Stimulation of protein palmitoylation and a possibility of changing the acylation status of G proteins is described, as well as interaction of palmitoylcarnitine with protein kinase C. Diminished interaction of the isoform δ of this kinase with GAP-43 (B-50, neuromodulin), whose expression increases upon accumulation of either carnitine or palmitoylcarnitine points to a possible regulation of differentiation by these compounds and their role in neuroregeneration.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria play important roles in human physiological processes, and therefore, their dysfunction can lead to a constellation of metabolic and nonmetabolic abnormalities such as a defect in mitochondrial gene expression, imbalance in fuel and energy homeostasis, impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, enhancement of insulin resistance, and abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism. As a consequence, mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, vascular disease, and chronic heart failure. The increased knowledge on mitochondria and their role in cellular metabolism is providing new evidence that these disorders may benefit from mitochondrial-targeted therapies. We review the current knowledge of the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to chronic diseases, the outcomes of experimental studies on mitochondrial-targeted therapies, and explore the potential of metabolic modulators in the treatment of selected chronic conditions. As an example of such modulators, we evaluate the efficacy of the administration of L-carnitine and its analogues acetyl and propionyl L-carnitine in several chronic diseases. L-carnitine is intrinsically involved in mitochondrial metabolism and function as it plays a key role in fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism. In addition to the transportation of free fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, L-carnitine modulates their oxidation rate and is involved in the regulation of vital cellular functions such as apoptosis. Thus, L-carnitine and its derivatives show promise in the treatment of chronic conditions and diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction but further translational studies are needed to fully explore their potential.},
