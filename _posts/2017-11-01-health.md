# Pseudovitamin Mix

* 1g Acetyl-L-carnitine
* 1g Trimethylglycine
* 1.5g Citrulline
* 1g N-acetylcysteine
* 1g Beta-Alanine
* 1g Taurine
* 0.1g Vitamin C
Total: 9.6g daily (~1 Tbsp.) in 500ml water.
Description: White powder. Easily mixes in water. Slightly sour tasting.
I often add a broad spectrum electrolyte mix such as Ultima Replenisher for taste and to cover my bases.
