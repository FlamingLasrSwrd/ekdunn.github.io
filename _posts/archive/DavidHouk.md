David Bruce Houk. Known to me and the rest of his grandchildren as "Grampy". A teacher. A patriarch. A champion of his own will. Grampy was a remarkable man.

I do not remember the first time I met my grandfather. Surely it would have been within my first year of life. All I have left of him are a few choice memories spanning the last decade of his life and the second of my own.

One of my earliest memories is not something that he did in any particular instance, but of my own thoughts surrounding him. I could not understand why this man was so important to my family. *thoughtful tone* Why did the room seemed to focus on his words exclusively as he spoke? *teaching tone* By all appearances, this man did not possess the grandiosity required of great leaders. Compared to the imposing CEOs and heads of state I saw on TV, this quaint man was not leader material.

And yet, *contemplative pause* my family all seemed to relinquish their authority to him. His words were received with absolute credulity; as if those words had a subliminal message of authority which I was not privy. And in fact, they did. Grampy's words carried years of unusually profound truth and wisdom; The cumulative experience and knowledge gathered in three quarters of a century. My family's careful attention was not misplaced, but refined and reinforced through time. Unlike the powerful CEO who may not have risen to power by acquiescence of their minions, my family gave their trust willingly to a better man. He was a true benevolent patriarch.

Grampy's battle with cancer was long and arduous. In the end he refused treatment. At the time, I thought this was the act of a coward. How could a man of such stature be frightened by pain? For these thoughts I am truly ashamed.

Grampy believed the mind to be the essence of the individual. The body is unimportant so long as the mind remains in tact. The cancer had begun to consume his mind and the precipice was reached. He could no longer function as the family patriach, and so he invited death. His choice was not made out of self-preservation or fear, but of love and sacrifice.

Grampy was a teacher at heart. One particular summer he shared with me a project from his own youth that was in dire need of refinishing. I took to this project with vigor. At one point during my construction he asked me what seemed a silly question. He pointed out a flaw in my reasoning. In my ignorance and youthful pride, I gave him a hand-wavy response, not really considering the question he had posed. He did not argue or attempt to correct me. Only now do I realize that he expressely knew what I did to be incorrect. Grampy had the forethought to put aside his pride so that I might learn on my own. He presented me with a simple question. My understanding after-the-fact took nearly a decade. How much of what Grampy tried to teach me is now lost by misinterpretation and youthful indignation? What else did I miss and what do I not yet understand?

*Pause*

Great men need not comfort or appraisal in life. They seek neither fame nor infamy. Their influence needs no attribution. They merely require a single **listener**.

**David Bruce Houk** was a great man, and I listen to him even now.
