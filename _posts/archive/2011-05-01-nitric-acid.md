# Background

Its probably best if you read the Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid">Nitric Acid</a> first.
Nitric acid is made industrially by oxidizing ammonia in the presence of a catalyst then passing the resulting nitrogen dioxide through water. That is sort of out of the realm of possibility for the home experimenter. Although, copper is almost as effective a catalyst and ammonia is sold as a household cleaner just about everywhere. I won't get in to purifying ammonia from cleaners for fear of being arrested as a meth cooker. Anyway... most home nitric acid syntheses use decomposition of a nitrate salt to obtain the nitrogen dioxide. Passed through water (or hydrogen peroxide to increase yields) gives a very weak nitric acid. Higher concentrations can be obtained by distillation in an all glass apparatus. Nitric acid forms an azetrope with water at 70% concentration however. You can obtain higher concentrations with the addition of a drying agent -usually sulfuric acid.

# Synthesis

The best way to illustrate Nitric Acid synthesis is with a video made by Nurd Rage at the top of the page. He makes a lot of great videos this one included. I won't go into too much detail because it is just a copy of his last set up.

## Preparation

Nurd Rage suggests a <a target="new_window" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXQwVdTZd_g">mineral oil</a> bath to keep decomposition to a minimum. I purchased sodium nitrate online but you can use any nitrate salt. I had to use an old book for support and to level everything out.

Adding the sodium nitrate. I used 192.75 grams because that is what I had left. I added 67 mL of sulfuric acid. That's 10% above stoichiometric amounts to absorb the water from decomposing nitric acid. Theoretically this should produce 89 mL of concentrated nitric acid.

## Results

Unfortunately while I was removing the catcher flask it dipped into some of the cooling water and got diluted. Essentially I just wasted hours of my life. Yet another elementary proof of Murphy's Law. Here is what I got.

## What Not to Do

The resulting sodium sulfate is rock hard and dissolving it in water takes a long time. I thought I would speed it up a little bit by swirling the water around in the condenser. Not a good idea. The sulfate came loose from the glass and broke a hole. It is best to be patient and dissolve the sulfate slowly.

One great thing about glass is that you can clean it with a razor blade. Some of the oil from a previous run dripped down and burned on the bottom. No amount of scrubbing could clean it. About ten seconds with a razor blade and it was spotless.

Just to make sure this really is nitric acid I poured some over a bit of copper. The characteristic brown nitrogen dioxide gas and blue copper nitrate are produced.

# Improvements

<a target="new_window" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_distillation">Vacuum distillation</a> would be awesome for this. Previous distillations result in about 2/3 of the nitric acid lost to decomposition. Not a very efficient process huh? Reducing the pressure lowers the boiling point and reduces decompostion. Since a small amount of corrosive nitrogen dioxide is produced the vacuum connection would have to be bubbled through water first. Maybe it would be easier to just buy it?... Then again who wants to do that??
