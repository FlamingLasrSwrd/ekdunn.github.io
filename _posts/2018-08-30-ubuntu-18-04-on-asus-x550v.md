  Getting Ubuntu 18.04 to work on an Asus laptop with Nvidia graphics using a few grub boot flags.

# Intro
Ubuntu does not play nice with hardware. Especially Nvidia graphics. The X550V Asus laptop comes with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M card. In addition, something about PCIE seems to mess things up during the install. I found [this](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1767594) bug, but that only solved my graphics problem. I still had locked CPUs, screens upon screens of PCIE errors, and frozen screens after log in. All it took were a few grub flags and it worked just fine.

# Install Ubuntu
For the installation, make sure to edit the boot flags. Replace ```quiet splash``` with ```nomodeset acpi=force intel_idle.max_cstate=1 pci=nomsi pcie_aspm=off```. Then run your installation as normal and reboot. This time add ```nouveau.modeset=0 acpi=force intel_idle.max_cstate=1 pci=nomsi pcie_aspm=off``` the end of the line that starts with *linux*. Your laptop should boot without issue. Once logged in modify the file ```/etc/default/grub``` so it reads:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=force intel_idle.max_cstate=1 pci=nomsi pcie_aspm=off"
```
Then update grub ```sudo update-grub```.
Go to the "additional drivers" tab of *Software and Updates* and select the appropriate Nvidia driver for your card. As of this writing, it is nvidia-driver-390. Save the changes and reboot.
There you have it. You should have a fully functioning system now with the latest Nvidia driver.
**Note**: I have no idea why those grub flags work or even what they do. This worked for me, and that's the only guarantee I make.
