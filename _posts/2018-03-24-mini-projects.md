# Penny Charms
A friend of mine is making a necklace and needs a few charms made from pennies.

They are all 2013 pennies. Holes were drilled and countersunk to prevent wear. The rings are made from 14 AWG copper wire and soldered with lead-free (silver) solder. I attempted to solder the ring directly to the penny at a 90 degree angle, but couldn't get the solder to flow well enough to make it attractive.
