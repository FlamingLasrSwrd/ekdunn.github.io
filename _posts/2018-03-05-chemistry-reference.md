# Copper Catalysts for Primary Alcohol Dehydrogenation

## Cu/Al2O3 + Urea
-> approximately 23% wt. Cu with 41 sq.m/g Cu surface area

- 20.6g (0.110 mol) of Cu(NO3)2 is added to 2L 1.2M Urea solution in a 3L flask
- 20g of 200 mesh gamma-alumina is added
- the solution is heated to 90-95C with constant stirring for 7+ hours or until pH=7.5
- the solution is filtered; washed with dH2O; calcined at 400C for 24 hrs
- the resulting catalyst is reduced with flowing hydrogen at 250C for 5 hrs
  - alternatively, catalyst can be activated in situ with primary alcohol

## Cu/SiO2 + Ammonia
-> approximately 17% wt Cu with 41 sq.m/g Cu surface area
- 11.3g Cu(NO3)2*3H2O is dissolved in 150ml dH2O
- 18ml of 28% Ammonia soln. is added over 30 min with stirring
- 12g of fumed SiO2 is added
- stir for 4hrs at 35C
- heat soln to 90C for 2 hrs or until pH reaches 6-7
- filter and wash with dH2O
- dry overnight at 120C
- calcine at 450C for 4 hrs
