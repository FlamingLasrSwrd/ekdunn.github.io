Keylogging and mouse tracking data can be used as a primary endpoint for evaluating the effect of any *quantified self* data that one seeks to track. RescueTime is also available to monitor mouse movement and time.

# Summary
I am slightly obsessed with productivity. In the past, I have used 'how I felt' about my productivity as the primary endpoint instead of actually measuring it. In the last month, I have committed to finding at least some measure of my productivity that is objective. Since I do almost all my work nowadays on the computer, monitors that track my activity there are a good start. So I choose to activate RescueTime and logkeys. I am also participating in a [Harvard doctoral study][] that sends me thrice daily surveys on my happiness and some factors that might be related.
Hopefully these data will lead to some interesting correlations that I can later test. Supplementation is probably a big player here and I have yet to devise a passive way to measure that. Still working on untracked productivity such as any project in the real world...
