# Welcome to my Lair

## Tiny Room

My current accommodations include a bedroom that is 11' by 11' with two closets spanning the same wall measuring another 2' deep. This is quite a decrement from my last housing situation which included basement and garage storage. At least I get to throw away all (many) of the things I have been hoarding for years.

My attention over the last year has turned to biology and with it comes new lab requirements. I would benefit greatly from a clean room with HEPA or equivalent air filtration. My glovebox can handle all the sterile work, but I still need something at least ISO class 8 or better. But where to put it...


## The Pieces

At the moment I have a glass L-shaped desk for my computer which measures 5' by 5' at the outside corners with each leg of the *L* measuring 2' deep. Furthermore, I built two work tables last year with a footprint of 2' by 4'. One is 37.5" tall, and the other is 42.5" tall. I am willing to give one up if I must...

Of course science isn't all that I must fit into this room. A chest-of-drawers makes up the remainder of the large furniture with a dimensions 3' by 1.5' by 4'2". What about a bed you ask... right now I have a bed roll composed of various squishy mats which I roll and unroll every day. Not very comfortable and probably not very healthy. So amongst all this furniture, I must include a bed. Full size is probably the best balance between comfort and size.

# Alternative Beds

* [murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_bed)
  * requires permanent modifications to apartment
* [trap door hideaway](http://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2012/1/25/0/CI-Ikea_live-reverse-bunk-bed_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.966.725.jpeg)
  * possible, but requires clearing project space every day
* hammock
  * same as murphy
* [cot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_bed)
  * possible, but not very comfortable
* [petate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petate) or bed-roll
  * same as cot
* [charpai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charpai) rope beds
  * same as cot

Ultimately I settled on a lofted bed. Vertical space is the final frontier. I briefly considered putting the clean room directly under the bed, but that would only leave about 5' of height and I stand 5'11" tall.

## Basic Description

I don't need anything particularly fancy, so cheap pine will suffice. A full size bed is 54" by 75" and from 5" to 20" thick. I slept on a bunk bed as a child. I have one very traumatic memory of falling from the top bunk, so I think a railing is in order. A small end-table would be nice for an outlet and phone charger. Recycled wood is cheaper.
