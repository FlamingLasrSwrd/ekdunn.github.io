Timber on my parent's property for retirement.<!--more-->

# Intro
My parents have a stretch of land of approximately twenty acres which, at the present moment, is doing nothing. Our neighbor bails hay from the land a few times a year. We don't charge him for this service since it keeps small trees and shrubs from taking over.

Since none of us children want to farm the land or wish to rent it out, I decided to look into timber production. The idea is to have a minimally managed tree farm from which my siblings and I can retire. Initial projections indicate that 10-15 acres of properly managed black walnut trees can provide an income of $300k to $1M after 40-60 years. Growth time variation is largely site specific, and the income variation is largely management specific. A similarly sized veneer quality tree can go for 3-15x the price of a sawlog tree. The goal, then, is to maximize the production of veneer quality logs.

This page is dedicated to developing a plan and schedule for establishing a primarily black walnut timber plantation on 12 acres of north eastern Kansas forest/grassland.

## Initial Conditions

### Suitability Index

Factor                      | My value          | Criteria Value (0-1; higher is better)
----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------
Depth Limit(multiplicative) | >200cm (none)     | 1
Flood Duration              | None              | 1
AWC limit(multiplicative)   | 31.5cm            | 1
Wetness                     | >200cm            | 1
Depth(additive)             | >200cm (none)     | 1
Texture                     | 25% clay; 3% sand | 1,1
AWC(additive)               | 31.5cm            | ?
pH                          | 6.1               | ?
Fragments                   | 0                 | 1
Flood Frequency             | none              | 0
Landform                    | summit-shoulder   | 0
Historic Vegetation         | woodland          | 1

**Total Index Value:** ```1*(.21*1+.21*1+.21*1+.08*0.85+.08*1+0.07*1) = **0.85**```[^1]

*?* Doesn't give any indication of how "Sigmoid curve scaled" is conducted.
