# Work Log

## 15 Jul 2019
Attempted the synthesis. I won't be doing this again. Adding the sulfuric acid results in a lot of decomposition. The ammonia reaction didn't go to completion because there wasn't enough water. Better to pay the extra money and buy the nitrate and ammonium salts separately.

- NH4NO3 + NaOH → NaNO3 + NH3 + 2H2O
- (NH3 + 2H2O) + 2.15H2O → NH4OH + 3.15H2O
- NaNO3 + 0.5H2SO4 → 0.5Na2SO4 + HNO3

Starting from 180g ammonium nitrate (the contents of two ice packs) in 500mL flask:

- add 130.52g sodium hydroxide
- heat until all water has been removed; bubble the effluent through 90g distilled water
- add 70ml conc. sulfuric acid (slight excess)
- distill nitric acid at 83C
- yields: 38g ammonia as 128g (142ml) 30% NH4OH (80g NH4OH); 70g (46ml) nitric acid

NaOH is probably the monohydrate form. Would that be enough water to dry mix the ingredients and distill the ammonia?
