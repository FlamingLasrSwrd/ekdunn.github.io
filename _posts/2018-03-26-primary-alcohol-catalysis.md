  Oxidation/dehydrogenation of primary alcohols using catalysts to form their corresponding aldehydes.

# Ethanol

Ethanol can be dehydrogenated to ethanal (acetaldehyde) over a catalyst (typically copper) at high temperatures. Depending on the catalyst, other products such as ethyl acetate can be formed.

CH3CH2OH ->[Cu] CH3CHO + H2

# Methanol

Methanol can similarly be dehydrogenated to methanal (formaldehyde) over a catalyst (typically copper) at high temperatures.

CH3OH ->[Cu] CH2O + H2

User jimmymajesty achieved excellent results by using air-oxidized copper plated nichrome wire in a ketene apparatus <http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=55&goto=search&pid=176566>

- Investigating the production of mesoporous carbon catalysts.
- Carbon has high selectivity compared to silica, but it suffers from short lifespan. Copper sintering seems the issue. Lack of interaction with the base material is the cause. @wang_cu_2018
- Carbon can be deposited on silica supports with the layer of catalyst further deposited on that.
- Searching for a suitable mesoporous carbon precursor...
- Furfural alcohol might be ok since it can be made from agricultural byproducts and sulfuric acid followed by hydrogenation. @noauthor_furfural_1921
- Sucrose could work @bohme_templated_2005 @ryoo_synthesis_1999
- 52.5 kJ mol => 49 BTU; easily done with bunsen burner; heat loss is probably biggest problem
- chromite stabilization is another option but isn't good for the environment
- instead of mesoporous carbon... graphene? @morales_bioethanol_2016
- I haven't found anything on electrooxidation in DES
- As far as setup goes: something akin to [Doug's Lab Ketene Lamp](https://youtu.be/_1mMW2qEF84) but with a core of catalyst heated by resistance wire?

Isolating various metalic catalyst precursors:

- Barium (rust converter)
    - **cheaper as [barium carbonate glaze](https://digitalfire.com/4sight/material/barium_carbonate_86.html)**
- Nickel (US 5 cent piece)
    - available as [nickel carbonate colorant](https://digitalfire.com/4sight/material/nickel_carbonate_1073.html): better to buy because of toxicity issues with electrolyzing nickel compounds
- Gold (from previous experiments)
- Platinum
