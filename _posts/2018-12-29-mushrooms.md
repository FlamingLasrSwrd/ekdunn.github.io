# Work Log

## 12 Jan 2019
Studying the various process techniques and grains for spawn production.

### Process Variables
- Rinse
- Soak
- Sterilization times
- Sterilization temperatures

### Grains
- Wheat
      - hard winter red
      - gold
      - bulk
- Rye
- Millet (sorghum)
      - popping
      - gold
- Economy Bird Seed mix
- Popcorn
- Sunflower seeds
- Oats

### Grain Characteristics
- As packaged
      - density
      - moisture content
      - roughage percentage
      - "floaters" percentage
- 24 hour soak
    - density
    - moisture content
    - bursting percentage
- Contamination frequency

### Investigating local substrates and supplements
I'm looking into vitamin and mineral supplementation.
- What about formulated feed pellets with amendments?
    - [Producers Pride 12%](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-12-horse-pellet-50-lb?cm_vc=-10005)
- SSF in tubes and extension rates for various substrate mixtures would be ideal [@philippoussis_agro-food_2015]
- Gathering some other data on productivity besides just growth rate and BE?
    - crude protein, fat, carbohydrate assays?
    - C/N ratio
    - ash
    - water content

### What to select for?
- Ultimately appearance and fresh weight are primary factors affecting sale price (labeling may also contribute)
    - profit is based mainly on product weight per unit time less labor and substrate costs
- Labeling: variations on how 'Local' [@burnett_consumer_2011]
- Price Premiums: Local; Organic; Carbon-Footprint; [@onozaka_does_2011]


## 29 Dec 2018
