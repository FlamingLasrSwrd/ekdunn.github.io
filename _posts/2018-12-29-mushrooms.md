### Investigating local substrates and supplements
I'm looking into vitamin and mineral supplementation.
- What about formulated feed pellets with amendments?
  - [Producers Pride 12%](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-12-horse-pellet-50-lb?cm_vc=-10005)
- SSF in tubes and extension rates for various substrate mixtures would be ideal [@philippoussis_agro-food_2015]
- Gathering some other data on productivity besides just growth rate and BE?
  - crude protein, fat, carbohydrate assays?
  - C/N ratio
  - ash
  - water content

### What to select for?
- Ultimately appearance and fresh weight are primary factors affecting sale price (labeling may also contribute)
  - profit is based mainly on product weight per unit time less labor and substrate costs
- Labeling: variations on how 'Local' [@burnett_consumer_2011]
- Price Premiums: Local; Organic; Carbon-Footprint; [@onozaka_does_2011]
