# Zinc Purification
Zinc Carbonate
  - 125.388 g/mol
  - ZnCO3
Zinc Sulfate
  - 161.436 g/mol
  - ZnSO4
Sodium Carbonate
  - 105.99 g/mol


1. Zinc sulfate made previously by reacting impure zinc with sulfuric acid, filtering, then evaporating to dryness.
2. 50.0 g zinc sulfate
3. 57.7 g/100 ml solubility in H2O @ 25 &deg C; 101g/100ml H2O at 70 &deg C
4. added 100 ml dH2O
5. add extra 25 ml dH2O
6. filtered
7. rinsed with dH2O
8. add 0.15g powdered zinc metal
9. stir for 5 min
10. filtered
11. let sit 48 hrs
12. 2x filter (small white precipitate formed)
13. recrystallized- evaporated until first crystals formed then cooled in freezer
14. 33g sodium carbonate dissolved in 100ml H2O, filtered
15. Added to sulfate soln. until pH 7 - overshot adjusted with dilute HCl
16. evaporated to dryness; yield: 38g ZnCO3 hydrate
17.
