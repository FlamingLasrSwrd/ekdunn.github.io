**Update 30 Dec 2018:** Molded refractories are a pain to deal with because of the required compression. A better option is to make a brick mold and build your furnace separately.


# Introduction
Chemically bonded vermiculite (CBV) is so easy and extremely cheap. It really only has one ingredient: vermiculite. Commonly sold as loose fill attic insulation or as a soil amendment by the cubic foot. With a little bit of an acid binder and some force, CBV can withstand temperatures high enough to melt copper with low shrinkage and high insulating value. The only downside is the need for a strong mold to withstand ~350 kPa during the ramming process. Thick wood works just fine, so it isn't really a major downside.

Initial tests using a brick style mold worked great. Baking the mold in the oven for a few hours increases the hardness sufficiently that it can be removed without cracking. Half an hour under a bunsen burner greatly increases the strength. The finished brick can be easily cut with a wood saw. Testing on a lab furnace mold didn't work as well, however. It fit into my oven just fine, but the wood mold was close enough to the heating coil that it started to burn. So I had to cut the drying phase short. This resulting in the whole thing crumbling when the mold was removed. Solution: either use individual bricks to build a furnace al la Doug's Lab and others, or use a heat proof mold.

## Stats of CBV
characteristic                   | value
---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
density                          | 400-600 kg/m^3
bending strength                 | 0.49 – 0.56 MPa (4.8 – 5.5 kg/cm^2 )
linear reheat shrinkage at 1150C | 0.6 – 0.8%
heat conductivity at 350C        | 0.09 – 0.16 W/(m K)
heat conductivity at 650C        | 0.11 – 0.18 W/(m K)
maximum temperature              | >1150C [@suvorov_vermiculite_2003]

For comparison Kaowool typically has heat conductivity of 0.06-0.08 W/(m K) at 206C (*better*) and 0.21-0.47 W/(m K) (*worse*) at 816C. It has a similar continuous use maximum temperature (1100C). It is sold in a range of densities 48-192 kg/m^3.

material | melting temperature
---------|--------------------
aluminum | 660C
bronze   | ~950C
gold     | 1064C
copper   | 1084C

Using a clay binder instead of a chemical one will increase the heat conductivity but it may increase the strength. Probably make it a lot easier to work with too. Plus its not commonly sold in hardware stores except in small containers meant for furnace patch work.

# WARNING
**This procedure involves strong acids and potentially carcinogenic substances (when inhaled). Wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask.**

# Recipe

## Ingredients
- 100 parts vermiculite insulation
- 5 parts magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Epsom salts)
  - dissolve MgSO4 in 20 parts water
- 4 parts 35% phosphoric acid (concrete etch)
- 10 parts 92% sulfuric acid (drain cleaner)

## Instructions
- calculate total volume of refractory material needed for your mold
- multiply by 350 kilograms per cubic meter (22 pounds per cubic foot) to obtain the necessary weight of vermiculite to start with
- measure out that amount of vermiculite
  - this will likely be done in batches
- measure out 5% of the mass of vermiculite as magnesium sulfate heptahydrate
- dilute magnesium sulfate in 4 times its mass in water
- use a spray bottle to coat the vermiculite in the magnesium sulfate solution while mixing thoroughly
- measure out 4% of the mass of vermiculite as dilute (~35%) phosphoric acid
  - this can be obtained as concrete etcher (not the muriatic acid kind)
- measure out 10% of the mass of vermiculite as concentrated (>92%) sulfuric acid and add to phosphoric acid
  - this can be obtained at drain cleaner from most hardware stores
  - *warning* this will generate a lot of heat
- use the spray bottle to coat the vermiculite with the acid mixture while mixing thoroughly
  - vermiculite should remain relatively dry and easy to mix
- ram small portions of mix into your mold using a hammer
  - the goal is 200-700 kPa (30-100 psi) compression which is roughly the force per unit area of a hammer strike across the hammer head
  - the greater the compression -> the greater the strength -> the lesser the insulation
  - mixture must be used within a few hours
- after ramming, the refractory has enough strength to be handled lightly
- the strength can be increased by first drying and then calcining (optional)
- drying occurs above 200C (400F)
- calcination is complete somewhere around 1100C (2000F)

## Example
- I have a mold that requires 20 liters (0.7 cubic feet) of refractory to fill
- That means I need a total of 7 kg vermiculite
- I can't do all that at once, so I'm splitting it into 3 batches:
  - 2.33kg vermiculite is added to mixing tub *wear a mask*
  - 117g epsom salts is added to spray bottle
  - 466g water is added to bottle and mixed thoroughly to dissolve
  - vermiculite is coated evenly with magnesium sulfate spray
  - 93g of dilute phosphoric acid is added to bottle *wear gloves*
  - vermiculite is coated evenly with phosphoric acid spray
  - 233g concentrated is added to bottle
  - coat the vermiculite evenly with sulfuric acid spray
  - pack the refractory into the mold a little at a time
  - repeat 2 more times for a total of 7kg vermiculite used
  - let sit overnight

- Refractory bricks: 8"x4"x2.5" -> 80 in^3 -> 0.0463 ft^3 -(23.6 lbs/ft^3)-> 1.09 lbs -> **fill each brick mold with 494g refractory mix**

1 brick (4"x3.5"x8"):

- 494g vermiculite
- 24.7g MgSO4*5H2O
- 98.8g H2O
- 49.4g H2SO4 + 19.8g H3PO4
- mixed; use mini spray bottle

*not enough pressure; molding wasn't as compact as original design*

## 29 Jun 2018
- The first vermiculite refractory went great; even hand compression had pretty good characteristics despite 1/5th the density

Recipe:
- 100 parts vermiculite
- 5 parts magnesium sulfate hemihydrate as 20% soln.
- add slowly; mix to uniformity
- 10 parts 92% H2SO4 + 2 parts 75% H3PO4; add slowly
- mix to uniformity
- compress into mold; 30-100 psi
- heat >180C until dry and solid

Test run:

- 25g vermiculite
- 1.25g mg sulfate + 5g H2O
- 2.5g H2SO4 + 1g ~40% H3PO4
