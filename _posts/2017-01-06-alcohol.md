- [ ] Both doses of curcumin lowered the hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels ( Table 2 ).
- [ ] The hepatic SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities were significantly suppressed in the alcohol control group compared to the normal group. However, both doses of curcumin supplementa- tion increased the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities.
- [ ] In this study, we showed that curcumin increases hepatic total AMPK protein expression, which is in turn associated with decreased FAS and PAP activities in mice that are chronically administered alcohol.
- [ ] However, both doses of curcumin increased the total AMPK and p-AMPK protein levels compared to the alcohol control mice ( Fig. 3 A).
- [ ] Nevertheless, curcumin supplementation at both doses lowered the PAP and FAS activities compared with the alcohol control mice ( Fig. 3 B and C) but did not affect the G6PD activity (Fig. 3 D).
- [ ] Alcohol administration increased the plasma leptin levels compared with the normal mice; however, curcumin supplementation decreased the plasma leptin levels close to those observed in the normal mice (Table 2 ). Both doses of curcumin significantly lowered the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels compared to the alcohol control group. The plasma total cholesterol concentration was reduced by the 0.02% curcumin dose, whereas the HDL-cholesterol concentration was increased by the 0.05% curcumin dose. Treatment with both doses of curcumin decreased the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio compared with that obtained in the alcohol control group ( Table 2 ).
- [ ] We used two relatively low doses of curcumin equivalent to a dose of 112 mg/day or 270 mg/day for a 70 kg human using an allometric scaling factor of 0.081 (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008 ); these doses are easily achievable by dietary changes or supplementation.
- [ ] The liver damage biomarkers, AST, ALT, LDH and ALP, were all significantly elevated by alcohol administration in mice fed high-fat diet. Curcumin supplementation at both doses significantly lowered the AST, ALT, LDH and ALP activities, which indicates reduced liver damage compared to the alcohol control group (Fig. 1A).
- [ ] The hepatic ADH activity was significantly suppressed in the alcohol control group compared to the normal group. However, supplement with the 0.05% dose of curcumin significantly increased the ADH activity (Fig. 2   A). Similarly, the ALDH activity was reduced in the alcohol control group, but both doses of curcumin (0.02% and 0.05%) elevated the ALDH activity compared to the alcohol control mice by 18% and 26%, respectively ( Fig. 2 B).
- [ ] Chronic alcohol administration resulted in increased CYP2E1 activity and CYP2E1 protein expression in the liver ( Fig. 2C and D). Conversely, curcumin supplementation (at both doses) significantly decreased the CYP2E1 activity to normal values ( Fig. 2C). Similarly, the CYP2E1 protein expression was also decreased to normal levels by curcumin supplementation ( Fig. 2D)


@basuroy_acetaldehyde_2005

- [ ] A significant body of evidence indicates that acetaldehyde is accumulated in the colonic lumen due to enteric microbial fermentation (22, 23). Intracolonic acetaldehyde level is dramatically increased by alcohol consumption (6, 20, 27).
- [ ] For this study, biopsies were collected from 25 subjects, including 13 men and 12 women.
- [ ] Biopsies were exposed to vapor-phase acetaldehyde, as described previously (2, 17), to achieve acetaldehyde concentration of 100–600 μM in the buffer bathing the tissue.
- [ ] EGF and l-glutamine were administered 10 min before acetaldehyde treatment.
- [ ] Results show that 1) acetaldehyde inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and slightly elevates the activation of p60c-Src and p125FAK, resulting in an increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human colonic mucosa; 2) acetaldehyde increases tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, E-cadherin, and β-catenin; 3) acetaldehyde reduces the levels of detergent-insoluble fractions of TJ and AJ proteins, leading to redistribution of these proteins from the intercellular junctions; and 4) both EGF and l-glutamine prevent the acetaldehyde-induced changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the levels of detergent-insoluble TJ and AJ proteins, and redistribution of these proteins from the intercellular junctions.
- [ ] The protective effect of l-glutamine on acetaldehyde-induced permeability is mediated by EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity (25).

- [ ] Collectively, our data suggest an important checkpoint role for hsps and their regulator HSF-1 in alcohol-induced TNF-α regulation. Although HSF-1-induced hsp70 in acute alcohol exposure could play an important role in regulation of inhibition of inflammation, hsp90 is supportive to induction of proinflammatory cytokines in alcoholic liver injury. Future in vivo pharmacologic hsp90 inhibitor studies will help provide evidence about the possibility of hsp90 as a target for treatment strategies in alleviating alcohol-induced liver injury.
- [ ] Here, we first determined whether alcohol by itself or in combination with LPS affects HSF DNA-binding activity and nuclear translocation. In the current study, alcohol treatment for 15 min–24 h represents “short-term or acute” alcohol exposure on the basis of decreased, LPS-induced TNF-α production [4, 6], whereas 72 h alcohol treatment in vitro represents “prolonged or chronic” exposure, determined by increased, LPS-induced TNF-α production, described previously by in vivo and in vitro studies [5, 8].
- [ ] Treatment of macrophages with physiologically relevant doses (25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM) of alcohol for 15 min significantly increased HSF-binding activity (Fig. 1B). A combination of LPS with alcohol (50 mM and 75 mM) resulted in a further augmentation of HSF DNA binding as indicated in the bar graph (Fig. 1B, lower panel), as compared with LPS or alcohol treatment alone (Fig. 1B).
- [ ] Heat shock at 42°C for 45 min, used as a positive control, showed the highest HSF-binding activity in monocytes (Fig. 1A) and RAW macrophages (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that HSF-binding activity was induced by short-term alcohol exposure and augmented by a combination of alcohol with LPS in monocytes and macrophages.
- [ ] These results suggest that alcohol exposure, acute or chronic, induces nuclear translocation of HSF-1 and facilitates DNA binding to influence target gene expression.
- [ ] Specifically, hsp70 and hsp90 play an important role in regulation of the TLR4-mediated, down-stream signaling pathway, leading to activation of NF-κB [13, 14].
- [ ] Hsp70 and hsp90 associate with TLR4 in lipid rafts and are essential for LPS recognition [15]. Hsp90 activity is required for constitutive and inducible IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB activation and increased TNF-α production [14]. On the other hand, heat shock-induced hsp70 inhibits intranuclear accumulation of NF-κB and prevents amplification of the inflammatory response [16].
- [ ] We have shown earlier that acute alcohol exposure impairs NF-κB activation [6], whereas chronic alcohol increases NF-κB-binding activity in primary human monocytes (P. Mandrekar et al., unpublished). Oxidative stress-induced ROS play an important role in induction of TNF-α production by alcohol [7, 21].
- [ ] Specifically, we show that in monocytes and macrophages, short-term alcohol increases HSF-1-binding activity and induces hsp70 mRNA and protein.
- [ ] In neuronal cells, acute and chronic alcohol exposure induces hsp genes such as hsp70, hsp90, glucose-regulated protein (grp)78, and grp94 via HSF-1 activation [20, 37, 38].
- [ ] Whereas at first interpreted as a signal of cellular adaptation to stress and protection from the injury, it is now being recognized that hsps and its transcription factor HSF-1 can also contribute to cellular injury [40].
- [ ] Here, we show that regardless of the duration of exposure, alcohol induces nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of HSF-1.
- [ ] In human cells, however, HSF-1 and HSF-2 share a common, functional region and are regulated differently. Although HSF-1 is the predominant type activated during stress, HSF-2 plays an important role in early development and also seems to participate in transcriptional regulation of hsps during stress [12, 41]. Our supershift experiments identify HSF-1 and not HSF-2 as the principle form affected by alcohol.
- [ ] Here, we show that although short-term alcohol alone does not affect hsp70, LPS-induced hsp70 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein are increased in macrophages. Hsp70 induction is regulated by cooperation from other transcription factors such as STAT1, which interacts directly with HSF-1 to induce hsp70 [45].
- [ ] Although it is likely that a chronic alcohol-mediated decrease in LPS-induced hsp70 could be a result of a lack of cooperation of STAT1, the role of STAT1 in induction of hsp70 by acute alcohol is still unclear.
- [ ] Here, it is likely that acute alcohol directly increases transcription of hsp70, which in turn could repress TNF-α gene expression. Hsp70 could act via sequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm [43, 44] or direct binding to TNF-α and inhibition of its release [42] in acute alcohol exposure.
- [ ] Our studies demonstrate that acute alcohol exposure showed no significant differences in total cellular hsp90 but decreased cytoplasmic hsp90 and correlated with HSF-1 activation in these cells.
- [ ] Thus, our results suggest that hsp90 inhibition may prevent the alcohol-induced augmentation of LPS-induced NF-κB-binding activity and TNF-α and subsequently reduce inflammation in ALD. Hence, we propose that hsp90 plays an important role in alcohol-induced inflammation.

@purohit_alcohol_2008
  - [ ] a loss of epithelium at the tips of the villi, haemorrhagic erosions and even haemorrhage in the lamina propria (Bode et al., 2001). Similar lesions were observed in volunteers 2-3 hours after ingestion of alcohol (15-20%, v/v) and in recently drinking alcohol abusing subjects (Bode et al., 2001).
  - [ ] The mucosal damage caused by alcohol might result in an impaired intestinal barrier function, enabling toxins of gut-inhabiting bacteria such as endotoxins to enter the systemic circulation and to contribute to liver injury after alcohol consumption.
  - [ ] An ethanol-induced increase in intestinal permeability was also reported in human subjects when smaller molecules were used as a permeability probe.
  - [ ] The permeability to PEG Mr 400 was found to be unchanged when compared to healthy controls, whereas the permeability to PEG Mr 1500 and Mr 4000 were distinctly enhanced and the prevalence of increased permeability to PEG 10000 was more than 10-fold higher in alcoholics (Parlesak et al., 2000).
  - [ ] These studies clearly indicate that alcohol can increase intestinal permeability to various macromolecules including endotoxin.
  - [ ] A similar protective role of EGF on acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions was also demonstrated in human colonic mucosa (Basuroy et al., 2005).
  - [ ] These researchers further demonstrated that L-glutamine protects the intestinal barrier function by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism. A similar protective role of L-glutamine on acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions was also demonstrated in human colonic mucosa (Basuroy et al., 2005).
  - [ ] Oat supplementation ameliorated all of these changes (Keshavarzian et al., 2001). Studies are required to understand the mechanisms by which oat supplement preserves intestinal permeability.
  - [ ] Furthermore, plasma endotoxin levels were also significantly elevated in actively drinking alcoholics without evidence of liver disease (Bode et al., 1987; Nolan, 1989), suggesting that alcohol itself can increase endotoxin levels presumably via increasing intestinal permeability to endotoxin.
  - [ ] Endotoxemia was reversible in the majority of patients with alcoholic fatty liver and in about 50% of patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis within 1 week following the cessation of alcohol intake (Fukui et al., 1991), further suggesting a direct role of alcohol in increasing plasma endotoxin levels.
  - [ ] In mice, plasma endotoxin levels were significantly elevated 1.5 hour after intragastric administration of 6g/kg ethanol by gavage, and this was associated with significant small intestinal injury (Lambert et al., 2003).
  - [ ] These mice developed significant liver injury 6 hours after ethanol administration, suggesting that alcohol is the causal factor for endotoxemia. Both human and animal studies suggest that alcohol mediates the transfer of endotoxin from intestine to the liver that results in the elevation of plasma enotoxin levels.
  - [ ] hese studies suggest that alcohol may not only increase intestinal permeability to peptidoglycan, but also works synergistically with it to induce liver injury.
  - [ ] In an intragstric infusion rat model of alcoholic liver injury, sterilization of intestine by antibiotics significantly attenuated liver injury by reducing plasma levels of endotoxin (Adachi et al., 1995), and in the same model, similar results were obtained by simultaneous feeding of probiotic lactobacillus GG bacteria (competitive inhibitor of Gram negative bacteria) to the rats (Nanji et al., 1994).
  - [ ] In the gastrointestinal tract, acetaldehyde can be generated from ethanol through mucosal and/or bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Seitz and Oneta, 1998).
  - [ ] Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the colonic lumen could be due to low efficiency of bacterial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to metabolize acetaldehyde in the colon (Nosova et al., 1998).
  - [ ] However, ethanol up to 5% concentration failed to increase paracellular permeability, suggesting that ethanol metabolism to acetaldehyde is required for the action.
  - [ ] This study showed that ethanol increased paracellular permeability at 7.5% concentration.
  - [ ] The importance of ethanol metabolism into acetaldehyde was further confirmed when acetaldehyde, and not ethanol, was shown to increase mucosal permeability in proximal rat colonic strips
  - [ ] In this study, investigators demonstrated that acetaldehyde induced disruption of interactions between E-cadherin, β-catenin and PTP1B by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, suggesting that this may be a mechanism whereby acetaldehyde impairs intestinal permeability.
  - [ ] Mice were treated with three intragastric doses of zinc sulfate at 5 mg zinc element/kg each dosing, with an interval of 12 hours, prior to acute ethanol challenge with a single oral dose of 6 g/kg ethanol.
  - [ ] Zinc supplementation attenuated ethanol-induced increases in serum endotoxin levels, serum ALT activity, and hepatic TNF-α levels. These changes were associated with prevention of ethanol-induced liver injury (Lambert et al., 2003; Lambert et al., 2004).
  - [ ] These results suggest that zinc brought these changes, at least in part, by preventing ethanol-induced transfer of endotoxin from intestine to circulation which could be ascribed to preservation of intestinal morphology and permeability.
  - [ ] n this study, ethanol exposure (1%, 2.5%, and 15%) increased expression of iNOS and increased production of NO and superoxide.
  - [ ] Pretreatment with iNOS inhibitor (L-N6-1-iminoethyl-lysine), peroxynitrite scavengers (urate or L-cysteine) or superoxide anion scavenger (superoxide dismutase) attenuated the damage caused by ethanol.
  - [ ] These results suggest that NO and superoxide anion generated in response to ethanol exposure may react with each other to form peroxynitrite which in turn may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequently disrupt intestinal barrier function.
  - [ ] These researchers further showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) may protect intestinal barrier function by stabilizing cytoskeleton via down regulating the activity of iNOS (Banan et al., 2003).
  - [ ] Overgrowth of Gram negative bacteria can result in increased production of endotoxin which can escape into portal circulation leading to increased plasma levels of endotoxin.
  - [ ] These studies suggest that chronic alcohol abuse can promote bacterial growth in the intestine;
  - [ ] Suppressing the growth of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine may reduce the amount of endotoxin which in turn may attenuate endotoxin-associated organ damage.
  - [ ] Whether probiotic treatment can attenuate ALD in humans needs further investigation.
  - [ ] Therefore, an intact intestinal barrier primarily formed by the epithelium is critical to normal physiological function and prevention of diseases.
  - [ ] it was shown that that Na+ - coupled nutrient (glucose, alanine, or leucine) transport triggers contraction of perijunctional actomyosin, thereby increasing intestinal tight junction permeability and enhancing absorption of nutrients (Madara and Pappenheimer, 1987).


@forsyth_intestinal_2014

- [ ] Alcohol metabolism by Cyp2e1 may be contributing to alcohol-induced effects on the intestine.
- [ ] Alcohol universally promotes increased permeability in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro; however, alcohol consumption induces intestinal hyperpermeability and endotoxemia in only a subset of human alcoholics [21] and [22].
- [ ] these findings suggest that, especially in vivo, the mechanisms that cause alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability are not fully established.
- [ ] circadian rhythm disruption markedly exacerbates alcohol-induced gut leakiness and alcoholic liver disease [65]. Therefore, circadian rhythm disruption may be one mechanism to promote alcohol-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver pathology accounting for a subset of alcoholics demonstrating these features.
- [ ] Cyp2e1-mediated alcohol metabolism results in the production of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress) and other damaging products [43], [44] and [45]. Thus, Cyp2e1-mediated products of alcohol could be the key mechanism of alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver injury.
- [ ] Importantly, together with our collaborators we have shown that Cyp2e1 knockout mice exhibit blunted intestinal leakiness after binge alcohol [47].
- [ ] Our lab and others have published alternative pathways for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability and understanding how these alternative pathways may dovetail into our current model is an important next focus of our laboratory.
- [ ] Our studies show that the anti-oxidant NAC prevents the alcohol–Cyp2e1 mediated increase in CLOCK and PER2 that in turn promotes intestinal hyperpermeability [46] and [47].
- [ ] Thus, antioxidants or Cyp2e1 inhibitors might therefore be used to reduce alcohol induced gut leakiness therapeutically. A second possible therapy is the use of prebiotics such as oats or probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG because we have shown that both pre- and probiotics ameliorate intestinal oxidative stress and gut leakiness in alcohol-fed rodents
- [ ] A third possible therapeutic avenue suggested by our data are greater attention to normalizing circadian disruption in the lifestyle of chronic alcohol users.
- [ ] Several recent studies have shown that alcohol and/or alcohol metabolism products such as acetaldehyde [25] (produced as a by-product of alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH) or stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [26], [27] and [28] disrupt intestinal barrier integrity via several mechanisms especially alterations in tight junction proteins [29], [30] and [31]. Intestinal epithelial tight junctions are the major regulators of intestinal permeability [32] and [33] thus altering tight junction protein expression and/or function will certainly impact intestinal barrier function.
- [ ] However, ADH-induced effects on tight junction proteins are unlikely to fully explain alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability since Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, a widely used cell line for alcohol studies [23], do not express ADH [34] and yet low dose (0.2%) alcohol exposure results in marked disruption of Caco-2 cell monolayer barrier function [26] and [35].
- [ ] Therefore we propose that the degree of circadian disruption in an individual patient may be one critical difference that makes that subject more susceptible to alcohol-induced gut leakiness.
- [ ] One reason for this variability for example could be individual variability in the ‘anti-oxidant capacity’ (redox state) of intestinal cells/tissue from a given individual due to diet, stress, or other factors. Another possibility very relevant to this review could be differences in individual expression of intestinal and/or liver Cyp2e1. Finally, there is the element of the effects of microbiota dysbiosis on gut leakiness.
- [ ] They showed that small intestine and colonic Cyp2e1 is induced by alcohol with individual variability in humans which may be contributing to the subset of individuals that demonstrate alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability and liver pathology [36].
- [ ] Thus, alcohol-induced circadian rhythm disruption in the intestine and/or liver may account for alcohol effects on intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver pathology. One mechanism accounting for alcohol-induced effects on the molecular circadian clock may be oxidative stress [73] and [74] as the molecular circadian clock has several elements that are redox sensitive.
- [ ] Thus, at a time when monolayers are exhibiting alcohol-induced hyperpermeability, the levels of these molecular circadian clock proteins are abnormally elevated.
- [ ] Thus, both the Caco-2 and in vivo data support that alcohol stimulation of the circadian clock protein PER2 occurs at a time when intestinal permeability is elevated and may be an important factor in alcohol-induced gut leakiness.
- [ ] To determine the relative contribution of oxidative stress in these effects, Caco-2 cells were pretreated with the anti-oxidantN-acetylcysteine (NAC), which blocked the alcohol-induced increase in CLOCK and PER2 proteins as well as intestinal hyperpermeability.
- [ ] Experiments with red blood cells show that redox state alone in the absence of transcription can regulate circadian rhythms [91] and cyanobacteria [92].

@hernandez_lipids_2016

- [ ] Ethanol-induced lipoperoxidation by oxidative stress [142] and its products decrease the intracellular reduced glutathione and increase its oxidized form [148].
- [ ] ethanol-induced oxidative stress provokes a loss of [cardiolipin] [152, 154–157] in conjunction with the appearance of HNE [157, 158].
- [ ] Interestingly, the neurodegeneration induced by ethanol can be prevented by an inhibitor of PLA2 in vitro [153, 161].
- [ ] Meanwhile, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: 22:6n-3) prevents neuronal apoptosis by promoting PS accumulation [162], while conversely, PLA2 activity and oxidation-mediated HNE production may diminish the levels of PS.
- [ ] The expression of serine palmitoyltransferase was localized in neurons and it was enhanced in caspase 3-positive neurons induced by ethanol [172], indicating that de novo ceramide synthesis participates in ethanol-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain.
- [ ] Interestingly, CerS6 is enhanced within hours of ethanol withdrawal as a compensatory effect [176].
- [ ] For example, aggressive behavior and depression are observed after acute postnatal exposure to ethanol, possibly due to a decrease in circulating tryptophan, followed by the depletion of serotonin in the brain [12, 13].
- [ ] For example, there is more cholesterol in neuron membranes exposed to ethanol [155].
- [ ] Hence, an increase in the cholesterol present in membranes may represent a compensatory mechanism to combat ethanol damage.
- [ ] In adults, the ethanol ingested is almost completely and instantly absorbed by passive diffusion, reaching a peak concentration in humans between 30 and 90 min.
- [ ] Solid food intake can reduce the ethanol absorption rate by 30% and it has been suggested that this effect is due to the need for food digestion prior to absorption process.
- [ ] As such, if food is taken in as a liquid then it would not produce this effect [49, 54].
- [ ] Moreover, a small amount of ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) classes I and IV [52, 55] in the stomach and intestine. This acetaldehyde can be absorbed along with ethanol and metabolized by the liver or other tissues.
- [ ] Absorption is more efficient in the small intestine than in stomach [49], a difference in absorption that is due to two factors.
- [ ] In the CNS, it can be found in microsomes [133] and it has been shown that, in acute ethanol poisoning, there is an increase of catalase activity in the cytosol, microsomes, and synaptosomes, as well as a reduction in the mitochondria of the rat CNS [131].
- [ ] This increase in catalase activity in the CNS may be adaptive processes induced by the increase in the hydrogen peroxide generated, as what occurs in the CNS of animals exposed to high concentrations of ethanol [134].
- [ ] Increased SOD activity is considered to be an adaptive response to oxidative stress, such as that induced by acute ethanol toxicity in the cerebral cortex [132]. However, acute ethanol intoxication reduces the activity of Cu, Zn-SOD in the cytosolic and microsomal fraction of the rat brain, and Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria [131].
- [ ] In the rat and human CNS, the greatest glutathione peroxidase activity is observed in the gray and white matter of the cerebral cortex [137, 138].
- [ ] Most first pass metabolism occurs in the liver [49, 55] and the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by proteins of the ADH family [56], of which class I (ADH1) and III (ADH3) enzymes metabolize ethanol in the liver [57, 58].
- [ ] Consequently ADH3 plays a more important role in the metabolism of alcohol at high concentrations. In addition, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) and catalase contribute to the metabolism of alcohol in specific circumstances, such as high ethanol concentrations [48, 60].
- [ ] The acetaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethanol is thereafter transformed to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [61], which can be further metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy, or these metabolites can be deposited in the plasma [62, 63].
- [ ] Most GRed activity is found in neurons and glial cells [139], and acute ethanol poisoning significantly dampens GRed activity in the cerebral cortex [140].
- [ ] The most important exogenous antioxidant in the CNS is vitamin E, and both vitamin E and vitamin C content in the CNS falls after ethanol consumption, whereas vitamin A content increases [131].
- [ ] The distribution of ethanol throughout the body is driven in direct proportion to water content of each tissue, especially at the ethanol steady-state.
- [ ] Since the blood flow to the brain remains relatively constant, changes in the blood concentration of ethanol are the most relevant factor influencing the amount of ethanol delivered to the brain and therefore for the different levels of brain intoxication [78–80].
- [ ] although metabolites of ethanol, like acetate, can also reach the brain as products of first pass metabolism [85].
- [ ] Recently, the metabolism of [2-(13)C]-ethanol was evaluated in the brains of rats, and products such as labeled acetate, glutamate, glutamine, and GABA were detected found [86].
- [ ] The oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde can occur in the brain through pathways that involve catalase, cytochrome CYP2E1, and ADH.
- [ ] Indeed, acetaldehyde production in the brain in vivo depends on catalase activity [85, 93] and catalase appears to be expressed in all neural cells.
- [ ] Studies using inhibitors of catalase and acatalasemic mice revealed that catalase is responsible for approximately half of the ethanol metabolism occurring in the CNS [91].
- [ ] Nonetheless, ADH4 inhibition avoids the synaptic dysfunction associated with severe alcohol intoxication in the hippocampus [89].
- [ ] This enzyme is induced in response to chronic drinking and it may contribute to the increased rates of ethanol elimination in heavy drinkers. Some endogenous substrates for CYP2E1 include acetone and fatty acids, both of which are abundant in the brain [95].
- [ ] Moreover, in human neurons CYP2E1 is known to generate ROS and nitric oxide through the induction of NADPH/xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase [99].
- [ ] Therefore, CYP2E1 and catalase are the main pathways in the brain that metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde, while ADH appears to play a minor role.
- [ ] Acetaldehyde is a biologically active compound and it has been implicated in alcohol addiction [100, 101], as well as inducing euphoria at low concentrations [102]. The effects of ethanol are modulated by acetaldehyde [100, 103], which in turn may react with endogenous substances to form other biologically active compounds.
- [ ] Moreover adducts like salsolinol (formed when acetaldehyde binds to dopamine) were also seen to be involved in neurotoxicity [106] and in reinforcing addictive ethanol conduct [107].
- [ ] However, the accumulation of NADH increases in association with ALDH activity [114] and if the NAD+/NADH ratio decreases, the amounts of superoxide radicals increase [115, 116].
- [ ] When cells or animals receive carnitine it acts as a neuroprotective agent, preventing ethanol-induced damage [147].
- [ ] Furthermore, ϖ type-3 unsaturated fatty acids and DHA provide neuroprotection in conjunction with an increase in the formation of acylethanolamine [161, 162], suggesting that the formation of the latter prevents the damage caused by the oxidative metabolism of ethanol. Finally, ethanol can also be metabolized as phosphatidylethanol, a molecule found in the brain of rats [192] that is possibly formed to avoid ethanol oxidation.
- [ ] Acylethanolamines can be found in the mitochondria in vitro [191] and palmitoyl requires carnitine to enter mitochondria.
