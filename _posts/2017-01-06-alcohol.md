# Goal
To abolish the toxic, unwanted effects of alcohol commonly known as a hangover by administration of commonly available dietary supplements without affecting greater damage in the long term.

## Secondary-Goals
* Minimize the effort required to avert a hangover
* Keep the wanted effects of alcohol intact
* Focus on short term, acute effects
* Maximize subsequent exercise performance
* Avoid xenobiotic alterations to physiology

# Current Formula

* glucose + glucose polymer
* saline + basic electrolyte solution
* glutamine
* Creatine
* zinc
* N-acetylcysteine
* Alpha-Lipoic Acid
* Acetyl-L-carnitine
* Agmatine

# Basics of Ethanol Metabolism

# Acute Effects of Ethanol

* hemorrhagic deterioration of the digestive tract
* tight-junction damage
* increased NADH/NAD+ ratio
* increased CYP2E1 activity
* increased utilization of antioxidants and subsequent decreased antioxidants capability
* decreased serum pH
* increased blood sugar followed by rebound hypoglycemia
*

## Vitamin C
Anti-oxidant prevent oxidative adducts
Only works as preloaded

## Creatine
cellular hydration
assorted effects

## Taurine
nAC taurine release preload
SAMe and GSH preservation
Liver oxidative stress

##SAMe
Methylation
Methionine metabolism preservation
- too expensive

## Aspirin
COX inhibitor, nonselective
gastric ADH inhibitor
minor uncoupling effects in mitochondria
Aspirin can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding
-> Only if really bad hangover...

## Zinc
gut disfunction prevention
immune modulation
Taken before to inhibit ethanol induced gut permeability

### Zinc-carnosine (expensive)
* prep according to EP0303380B1
* dose
 - 75 mg oral rinse split 4/day
 - 150 mg/d

## Melatonin
brain SCN clock changes

## Ornithine
pH modulation
Ammonia recycling

## Glutamine
Gut dysfunction prevention

## Glucose
Hypoglycemia, short term

## Glucose Polymer
Hypoglycemia, long lasting

## Fructose/Sucrose
NADH->NAD+ conversion substrate
after

## Saline (Banana Bag)
Hydration status
General health

## Beta-Alanine
Pre-loaded pH buffer in muscle
Or canosine...

## N-acetylcysteine
intestinal antioxidant
glutathione substrate

## Alanine
gut tight junction activation

## Leucine
gut tight junction activation

## Curcumin

## Grape Seed Extract
iNOS inhibition

## Agmatine
iNOS and peroxynitrite reduction
Neurotransmitter

## Acetyl-L-carnitine
Mitochondria transport and uncoupling

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid
Fe sequestration in mitochondria
glutathione upregulation
AMPK inhibition/leptin mimesis

## Malate
malate-aspartate shuttle
