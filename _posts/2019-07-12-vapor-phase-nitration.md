# Work Log

## 12 Jul 2019
- nitrating ketones results in only 9-13% yield [@wang_preparation_1985-2]
- mercaptans are added to hydrocarbon bottles -could contaminate
    - contamination can be removed by bubbling through NaOH solution [@jones_mercaptans_2013]
    - below pH 12.5 efficiency falls below 80% (figure 7; pp 7)
- recycling the propane by scrubbing out CO/CO2? [@lamb_removal_1920]
    - oxidation might require mixed copper/manganese oxides [@hutchings_ambient_1996; @kramer_structural_2006]
