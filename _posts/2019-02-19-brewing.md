  Brewing the easy way: with ozone sterilization.

# Intro
This project was inspired by [@dziugan_ozonation_2016]:

> Medium prepared from raw sugar beet juice and sterilized by ozonation is suitable for use in fermentation processes.

Instead of the traditional PBW washes and obsessive bleaching in homebrewing, I decided to test whether ozone can be used for effective and simple sterilant.

# Procedure

1. combine all ingredients except yeast in fermenter
  - no need to sterilize anything
2. bubble ozone through media for 20-30 minutes
3. let media rest while ozone dissipates (10-20 minutes)
4. add yeast
5. ferment as usual

# Work Log

## 29 Feb 2019
Strawberry wine:
- 6kg trimmed strawberries
- 3.6kg sugar
- EC-1118 yeast
- tap water to make ~5gal

I didn't sterilize anything or obsessively clean anything prior to use. I washed my hands. The carboy was previously stored with ~50ml of 95% ethanol inside to keep it clean. The strawberries were trimmed by removing the stems and any obvious damaged parts. They even sat at room temperature for 24hrs or so while prepped everything else.

I have no idea what the concentration of ozone is in the mini generator I pulled from a water cooler. It smells like ozone: that's all I know.

I will know in a few days whether the ozone worked by the smell of the effluent.
