# Introduction

I want(need) to be in school. Last night I was talking to a friend, lamenting my lack of access to people in my discipline. If only I could converse with another person in the AI field, I could determine if my ideas were novel and great or just moronic. She suggested that I attend grad school (like so many before her). So let's explore this possibility...

# Taking Stock

Its been almost a year and a half since I graduated with my B.S. in Physics. And let's face it, my academic performance is hardly grad school material in its own right. In that time I did a number of research projects, but I never completed them to my satisfaction. I didn't talk to my professors much in any of my classes. I just (barely) did the work. The only letter of recommendation I could think of getting would be from my first research program director, Prof. Murray, but that was eight years ago... In addition, my general GRE score was not great and I took it in 2015.

To recap:
* 2.95 GPA
* 1(3) letters of recommendation
* GRE: not a great score in 2015.

Can you see my apprehension with applying to grad school?

My only saving grace is my commitment to research. This website is a testament to that end. Every waking moment not spent keeping myself sane has been spent reading academic research. I have explored topics in biology, chemistry, neurology, artificial intelligence, architecture, philosophy, civil engineering, and many more subdisciplines.
