# Introduction

I want(need) to be in school. Last night I was talking to a friend, lamenting my lack of access to people in my discipline. If only I could converse with another person in the AI field, I could determine if my ideas were novel and great or just moronic. She suggested that I attend grad school (like so many before her). So let's explore this possibility...

# Taking Stock

Its been almost a year and a half since I graduated with my B.S. in Physics. And let's face it, my academic performance is hardly grad school material in its own right. In that time I did a number of research projects, but I never completed them to my satisfaction. I didn't talk to my professors much in any of my classes. I just (barely) did the work. The only letter of recommendation I could think of getting would be from my first research program director, Prof. Murray, but that was eight years ago... In addition, my general GRE score was not great and I took it in 2015.

To recap:
* 2.95 GPA
* 1(3) letters of recommendation
* GRE: not a great score in 2015.

Can you see my apprehension with applying to grad school?

My only saving grace is my commitment to research. This website is a testament to that end. Every waking moment not spent keeping myself sane has been spent reading academic research. I have explored topics in biology, chemistry, neurology, artificial intelligence, architecture, philosophy, civil engineering, and many more subdisciplines.

So how might I go about maximizing my chances of getting into a good program?

# What Grad School Committees Want

Every school lists a set of required, objective qualifications:
* GPA
* GRE score
* \# of recommendation letters
* various English language proficiency requirements

[According to]() Dr. Tracy Sheetz, Director of Gradate Admissions and Recruitment, West Virginia University, additional, more subjective requirements are also examined. *personal subjective rating follows each point*
* writing skills **4(5)**
* inquisitive and original thinking **4(5)**
* clearly defined goals **2(5)**
* good "fit" - depends on the school
* timely and organized **3(5)**
* follows directions **4(5)**
* intrinsically motivated **5(5)**
* invested in the process **4(5)**
* relevant professional experiences **1(5)**
* unique and individual character **4(5)**
* articulate **4(5)**
* credible **2(5)**

And from above
* academic background (GPA,GRE) **2(5)**

# Demonstration and Improvement

I see two possibilities here:

* Of those qualifications which I already possess, how might I demonstrate them to the committee?
* Of those which I do not possess, how might I learn or improve?

It seems reasonable to start at the ends of the spectrum of subjective ratings listed above and work my way inward. Possible goals are in **bold** in the next sections: Demonstrate and Improve.

## Demonstrate
Each subtopic has its own definition and process for demonstrating proficiency.

### Intrinsic Motivation
This site and the others I have (somewhere) are an appropriate demonstration of my motivation. **Completing the other tasks associated with this site** will accomplish this goal. Grad programs are looking for commitment to a particular discipline, however, so more specific demonstrations are necessary. I could **code the various AI algorithms and upload to github** to prove my knowledge in this particular field. I have many repositories of research articles, but none of them are very formal or properly demonstrated. I can **upload AI-specific research notes** and if possible **read more current AI journal articles**.

### Skilled Writing
I have a few pieces of writing that I have completed for various classes stored somewhere. I can **upload past writing demonstrations** to this site. Furthermore, I can **improve the writing quality of existing pages**.

### Inquisitiveness and Originality
This feature is a derivative of intrinsic motivation. I believe this feature will be demonstrated naturally by completing the other tasks here.

### Uniqueness and Individuality

### Articulation

### Organization and Timeliness


## Improve
Each subtopic has its own definition and process for improving proficiency.

### Professional Experience

### Goal Definition
I don't have a great track record when it comes to goal achievement. Goal setting, yes, but not achievement.

This page will serve to define my goals for the next year. I can **add to this page as I complete tasks**. A more dedicated "work log" might be in order.

### Credibility

This feature is one I can hardly do alone. Social proof is a powerful thing. 

### Academic Background
I cannot change my graduating GPA from KU. I *can* **take graduate level classes as a non-degree seeking student** and demonstrate my ability to perform academically now. I could also **take online classes** (MOOCs, self-study, etc.).
I can **retake the GRE** for a better score. This is likely a necessity anyway since GRE test scores have a limited lifespan.

### Organization and Timeliness


# Limitations

## Time

Time is my biggest factor here.
