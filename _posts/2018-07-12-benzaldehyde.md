# Introduction
Benzaldehyde is a precursor to a huge number of organic compounds. Synthesis in a high yield at a low cost is the ultimate goal. Expensive reagents are to be avoided. Bonus points for doing it quickly.

# Properties


# Methods

## Chromyl Chloride and Dichloromethane

- Attempt by Dennis Phillips aka NileRed: 51% yield [@dennis_phillips_making_2017]

## Benzoic Acid and Hypochlorite

- 12% yield based on Benzoic Acid. [@scott_daniel_benzaldehyde_2017]

## Sodium Persulfate and Iron-Copper Catalysts

> Ferrous-Copper Catalyst: Toluene (7.6 g.), water (35 ml.), ferrous sulphate (0.110 g.) heptahydrate, cupric acetate (0.072 g.) and methanol (8 ml.) are placed in a 250 ml. reactor.
>
> Sodium persulphate (47.05 g.) in an aqueous-methanol solution of sodium persulphate is added slowly to the mixture which is maintained at 70Â° C., in an atmosphere of nitrogen and under agitation.
>
> The organic phase is separated after two hours and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl ether.
>
> The combined organic phases are distilled to afford 8.29 g. (95% yield) of very pure benzaldehyde (compared against a pure sample). [@maggioni_process_1979]

- Attempt by sum_lab gave single-digit yields. [@sum_lab_benzaldehyde_2018]

## Cinnamon Oil
