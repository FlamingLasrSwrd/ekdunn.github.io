# Thermal Decomposition of Chlorates

**tl;dr** Heat very pure chlorate to its melting point. Hold temperature until it resolidifies. Extract and purify resulting perchlorate.

## Process

### Toaster over: Potassium Chlorate
* add dry, pure potassium chlorate to pyrex dish
* heat chlorate in toaster oven at highest setting
* chlorate should liquify and begin to bubble
  - if it doesn't, your toaster oven isn't hot enough
* remove when chlorate solidifies

## Background

### Why
Let's say you have a quantity of Chlorate but you are worried about spontaneous explosions in the presence of sulfur containing compounds. What are you to do without a platinum or lead dioxide anode? Thermal decomposition of course!

A form of this reaction is used as a stable source of oxygen where weight is a concern. The so called oxygen candles are a mix of chlorates, perchlorates, a minimum amount of fuel, and possibly some catalyst. When ignited, the fuel oxidizes just enough to keep the reaction at the proper temperature to decompose the chlorates, producing copious amount of oxygen. Some variant of this device is present in most commercial airliners as the oxygen source in those overhead masks.
