		"abstract": "The participation of the peripheral nervous system in the renal response to an acute ethanol administration was investigated in dogs. The animals received water or ethanol (3 g/kg), with and without 2 days pretreatment with reserpine. Each group was examined 18 hours after the water or ethanol administration. In comparison to water controls, both reserpine and ethanol produced similar increases with respect to renal hemodynamics. The combined treatment produced a further significant increase in effective renal plasma flow. Reserpine alone produced increases in the rates of filtration and reabsorption of sodium and chloride; ethanol and reserpine-ethanol treatments produced further increases but did not alter the excretory rates. Although all three treatments produced increases in the rate of filtration of potassium, only ethanol and reserpine-ethanol treatments increased the excretory rate. Magnesium excretion was decreased by reserpine and reserpine-ethanol in comparison to water and ethanol, respectively; but calcium excretion was elevated in all the treatment groups. Zinc excretion was increased in the ethanol group. The results suggest that the secondary action of ethanol to produce release and possible depletion of peripheral catecholamine stores is not primarily involved with its renal effects, except in the case of magnesium and zinc metabolism.",

In comparison to an equi-volumetric administration of water, the alcohol treatment produced elevations in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow at 10 and 18 hours after the acute dosage and after the chronic treatment. At 26 hours after the acute and after the chronic administration, the filtration fraction was significantly elevated. The percent tubular reabsorption of sodium showed an increasing trend during the acute and chronic administrations, attaining significance at 26 hours after the acute treatment. Potassium excretion was significantly increased at 18 hours after the acute administration while chloride excretion was not significantly altered by either acute or chronic ethanol treatment. The results suggest that acute or chronic alcohol administration produces renal vasodilation. Furthermore, the sodium retention after the acute treatment appeared to be dependent upon an increased potassium excretion whereas the increased reabsorption after chronic dosage may have been a result of an increased proximal removal of reabsorbate.",

		"abstract": "Erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 86rubidium uptake (as an index of Na+,K+-ATPase activity) as well as passive sodium uptake were measured in a group of young men in response to drinking either nonalcoholic beer (as a control) or the same drink with alcohol (1 ml/kg) added. Plasma alcohol concentration rose to 16.7 mM within 70 min of commencement of drinking. There was no change in uptake of 86rubidium or sodium after 60 min in either the alcohol or control studies. There was a late increase in plasma sodium levels 90 min after alcohol ingestion, attributed to fluid volume contraction following diuresis. In contrast, plasma potassium levels fell after alcohol ingestion. This was associated with a decrease in urinary potassium excretion, hence ascribed to an intracellular shift of potassium ions, a change inconsistent with NA+,K+-ATPase inhibition. It is concluded that acute moderate doses of alcohol do not influence NA+,K+-ATPase activity or passive sodium uptake in circulating erythrocytes. Unless vascular smooth muscle is more sensitive to the effects of alcohol in vitro, these findings make it less likely that inhibition of NA+,K+-ATPase mediates alcohol-related hypertension in man.",

Hepatocytes were isolated by means of the enzymatic method of Selgen using collagenase. The number and viability of isolated rat hepatocytes, incubated for 5 hours in culture media (Hepatocyte Medium) with ethanol and MgCl2 solutions with concentration amounting respectively to: 150 mM/dm3 of ethanol and/or 2 mM/dm3 of MgCl2, 4 mM/dm3 of MgCl2, were determined. Biochemical tests of hepatocytes were performed, consisting in the determination of the total content of ester-bound fatty acids in whole hepatocytes and their cell membranes after incubation. Confirmed normalising action of magnesium ions with respect to the effects induced in hepatocytes and their membranes by the presence of ethanol should be attributed to the important role of magnesium which it performs during reactions taking place with participation of ATP.",

		"abstract": "Although there is general agreement that chronic ingestion of alcohol poses great risks for normal cardiovascular functions and peripheral-vascular homeostasis, a direct cause and effect between the real phenomena of alcohol-induced headache and risk of brain injury and stroke is not appreciated. “Binge drinking” of alcohol is associated with an ever-growing number of strokes and sudden death. It is becoming clear that alcohol ingestion can result in profoundly different actions on the cerebral circulation (e.g., vasodilation, vasoconstriction-spasm, vessel rupture), depending upon dose and physiologic state of host. Using rats, it has been demonstrated that acute, high doses of ethanol can result in stroke-like events concomitant with alterations in brain bioenergetics. We review recent in vivo findings obtained with 31P-NMR spectroscopy, optical reflectance spectroscopy, and direct in vivo microcirculatory studies on the intact brain. Alcohol-induced hemorrhagic stroke is preceded by a rapid fall in brain intracellular free magnesium ions ([Mg2+]i) followed by cerebrovasospasm and reductions in phosphocreatine (PCr)/ATP ratio, intracellular pH, and the cytosolic phosphorylation potential (CPP) with concomitant rises in deoxyhemoglobin (DH), mitochondrial reduced cytochrome oxidase aa3 (rCOaa3), blood volume, and intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi). Using osmotic mini-pumps implanted in the third cerebral ventricle, containing 30% ethanol, it was found that brain [Mg2+]i is reduced 30% after 14 days; brain PCr fell 15%, whereas the CPP fell 40%. Such animals became susceptible to stroke from nonlethal doses of ethanol. Human subjects with mild head injury have been found to exhibit early deficits in serum ionized Mg (IMg2+); the greater the degree of early head injury (30 min–8 h), the greater and more profound the deficit in serum IMg2+ and the greater the ionized Ca (ICa2+) to IMg2+ ratio. Patients with histories of alcohol abuse or ingestion of alcohol prior to head injury exhibited greater deficits in IMg2+ (and higher ICa2+/IMg2+ ratios) and, unlike the subjects without alcohol, did not leave the hospital for at least several days. Women, for some unknown reason, exhibit a much higher incidence of morbidity and mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) than men. Data on 105 men and women with different types of stroke indicate that, on the average, a 20% deficit in serum IMg2+ is seen; total Mg (TMg) or blood pH is usually near normal. Women with SAH, however, exhibit much lower IMg2+ and higher ICa2+/IMg2+ ratios; the presence of ethanol in the blood is associated with even more depression in IMg2+ in SAH in women. It is possible that prior alcohol ingestion is, in large measure, responsible for a great deal of this unexplained higher incidence of SAH in women. It has recently been reported that the cyclical changes in estrogenic hormones appear to control the serum IMg2+ level in young women. A surge in estrogenic levels prior to SAH could thus precipitate, in part, the SAH. In other human studies, it has been shown that migraines and headache, dizziness, and hangover, which accompany ethanol ingestion, are associated with rapid deficits in serum IMg2+ but not in TMg. The former, and the alcohol-associated headache, can be ameliorated with IV administration of MgSO4. Premenstrual tension-headache (PTH) and its exacerbation by alcohol in women is also accompanied by deficits in IMg2+, and elevation in serum ICa2+/IMg2+; IV MgSO4 corrects the PTH and the serum deficit in IMg2+. Animal experiments show that IV Mg2+ can prevent alcohol-induced hemorrhagic stroke and the subsequent fall in brain [Mg2+]i, [PCr], pHi, and CPP. Other recent data indicate that alcohol-induced cellular loss of [Mg2+]i is associated with cellular Ca2+ overload and generation of oxygen-derived free radicals; chronic pretreatment with vitamin E prevents alcohol-induced vascular injury and pathology in the brain. New findings on isolated single cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells and the intact, in vivo brain microcirculation implicate lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, PKC isozymes, and activation of NF-κB in the signaling pathways. We believe all of the animal and human data are compatible with the idea that rapid alcohol-induced cellular losses of Mg2+ help to promote an ischemic pro-oxidant, proinflammay environment that would result in generation of free radicals with membrane lipid peroxidative properties, which can effect irreversible, or refractory, brain injury. Sequential measurement of brain [Mg2+] (and phosphometabolites) with 31P-NMR spectroscopy and measurement of serum IMg2+ and ICa2+ with specific ion-selective electrodes should be of great value in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated brain injury, headache, and stroke.",

		"abstract": "Most ingested ethanol is metabolized in the liver to acetaldehyde and then to acetate, which can be oxidized by the brain. This project assessed whether chronic exposure to alcohol can increase cerebral oxidation of acetate. Through metabolism, acetate may contribute to long-term adaptation to drinking. Two groups of adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were studied, one treated with ethanol vapor and the other given room air. After 3 weeks the rats received an intravenous infusion of [2-13C]ethanol via a lateral tail vein for 2 h. As the liver converts ethanol to [2-13C]acetate, some of the acetate enters the brain. Through oxidation the 13C is incorporated into the metabolic intermediate α-ketoglutarate, which is converted to glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and GABA. These were observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and found to be 13C-labeled primarily through the consumption of ethanol-derived acetate. Brain Gln, Glu, and, GABA 13C enrichments, normalized to 13C-acetate enrichments in the plasma, were higher in the chronically treated rats than in the ethanol-naïve rats, suggesting increased cerebral uptake and oxidation of circulating acetate. Chronic ethanol exposure increased incorporation of systemically derived acetate into brain Gln, Glu, and GABA, key neurochemicals linked to brain energy metabolism and neurotransmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe liver converts ethanol to acetate, which may contribute to long-term adaptation to drinking.

		"abstract": "It has been reported that chronic and acute alcohol exposure decreases cerebral glucose metabolism and increases acetate oxidation. However, it remains unknown how much ethanol the living brain can oxidize directly and whether such a process would be affected by alcohol exposure. The questions have implications for reward, oxidative damage, and long-term adaptation to drinking. One group of adult male Sprague–Dawley rats was treated with ethanol vapor and the other given room air. After 3 wk the rats received i.v. [2-13C]ethanol and [1, 2-13C2]acetate for 2 h, and then the brain was fixed, removed, and divided into neocortex and subcortical tissues for measurement of 13C isotopic labeling of glutamate and glutamine by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Ethanol oxidation was seen to occur both in the cortex and the subcortex. In ethanol-naïve rats, cortical oxidation of ethanol occurred at rates of 0.017 ± 0.002 µmol/min/g in astroglia and 0.014 ± 0.003 µmol/min/g in neurons, and chronic alcohol exposure increased the astroglial ethanol oxidation to 0.028 ± 0.002 µmol/min/g (P = 0.001) with an insignificant effect on neuronal ethanol oxidation. Compared with published rates of overall oxidative metabolism in astroglia and neurons, ethanol provided 12.3 ± 1.4% of cortical astroglial oxidation in ethanol-naïve rats and 20.2 ± 1.5% in ethanol-treated rats. For cortical astroglia and neurons combined, the ethanol oxidation for naïve and treated rats was 3.2 ± 0.3% and 3.8 ± 0.2% of total oxidation, respectively. 13C labeling from subcortical oxidation of ethanol was similar to that seen in cortex but was not affected by chronic ethanol exposure.",

Each trial demonstrated a high risk of bias in at least one domain. There was significant clinical and methodological variation between trials.\nWe found no study that measured all of the identified primary outcomes and met the objectives of this review. Only one trial measured clinical symptoms of seizure, delirium tremens or components of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) score. A single outcome (handgrip strength) in three trials (113 people), was amenable to meta-analysis. There was no significant increase in handgrip strength in the magnesium group (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.30). No clinically important changes in adverse events were reported.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nAuthors' conclusions\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine whether magnesium is beneficial or harmful for the treatment or prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol use, particularly excessive alcohol consumption is one of the most serious health risks in the world. A relationship between sport, exercise and alcohol consumption is clear and long-standing. Alcohol continues to be the most frequently consumed drug among athletes and habitual exercisers and alcohol-related problems appear to be more common in these individuals. Alcohol use is directly linked to the rate of injury sustained in sport events and appears to evoke detrimental effects on exercise performance capacity. The model of alcohol consumption in human experimental studies has either been acute (single dose) or chronic (repeated doses over a period). These studies suggested that alcohol consumption decreases the use of glucose and amino acids by skeletal muscles, adversely affects energy supply and impairs the metabolic process during exercise. In addition, chronic alcohol use is associated with increased citrate synthase activity and decreased cross-sectional area of type I, IIa and IIb fibres. There is evidence to suggest that exercise may attenuate the ethanol-induced decline in hepatic mitochondria and accelerates ethanol metabolism by the liver. Exercise training seems to reduce the extent of the oxidative damage caused by ethanol. Evidence generated from in vitro experiments and animal studies have also suggested that ethanol administration decreased skeletal muscle capillarity and increased pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Substantial epidemiological evidence has been accrued showing that moderate ingestion of alcohol may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Although the existing evidence is often confusing and disparate, one of the mechanisms by which alcohol may reduce the incidence of mortality of cardiovascular diseases is through raising levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Available evidence suggests that exercise and moderate alcohol consumption may have favourable effects on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis; however, compelling experimental evidence is lacking to endorse this notion. Occasional and chronic alcohol consumption is usually linked with unfavourable alterations in platelet aggregation and function and may be associated with platelet-related thrombus formation. Although the effects of alcohol consumption on the rheological properties of the blood are not known, recent experimental evidence suggests that alcohol use following exercise is associated with unfavourable changes in the main determinants of blood viscosity. It is well documented that alcohol use modulates the immune system and impairs host defence. Compelling evidence is also mounting to suggest that chronic alcohol use is linked with adverse effects on the body systems and organs including the brain, the cardiovascular system and the liver.",

		"abstract": "In alcohol-naïve systems, ethanol (<100 mM) exposure of calcium-gated BK channels perturbs physiology and behavior. Brief (several minutes) ethanol exposure usually leads to increased BK current, which results from ethanol interaction with a pocket mapped to the BK channel-forming slo1 protein cytosolic tail domain. The importance of this region in alcohol-induced intoxication has been addressed in Caenorhabditis elegans slo1 mutants. However, ethanol-induced BK activation is not universal as refractoriness and inhibition have been reported. The final effect depends on many factors, including intracellular calcium levels, slo1 isoform, BK beta subunit composition, post-translational modification of BK proteins, channel lipid microenvironment and type of ethanol administration. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and rodents show that protracted/repeated ethanol administration leads to tolerance to alcohol-induced modification of BK-driven physiology and behavior. Unveiling the mechanisms underlying tolerance is of major importance, as tolerance to alcohol has been proposed as predictor of risk for alcoholism.",

		"abstract": "High plasma homocysteine is a risk for cardiovascular disease and can be lowered through supplementation with 6 g/d of betaine. However, dietary intake of betaine is ∼0.5–2 g/d. Therefore, we investigated whether betaine supplementation in the range of dietary intake lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy adults. Four groups of 19 healthy subjects ingested three doses of betaine or placebo daily for 6 wk. A methionine loading test was performed during run in, on d 1 of betaine supplementation, and after 2 and 6 wk of betaine supplementation. Fasting plasma homocysteine after 6-wk daily intakes of 1.5, 3 and 6 g of betaine was 12% (P < 0.01), 15% (P < 0.002) and 20% (P < 0.0001) less than in the placebo group, respectively. Furthermore, the increase in plasma homocysteine after methionine loading on the 1st d of betaine supplementation was 16% (P < 0.06), 23% (P < 0.008) and 35% (P < 0.0002) less than in the placebo group, respectively, and after 6 wk of supplementation was 23% (P < 0.02), 30% (P < 0.003) and 40% (P < 0.0002) less, respectively. Thus, doses of betaine in the range of dietary intake reduce fasting and postmethionine loading plasma homocysteine concentrations. A betaine-rich diet might therefore lower cardiovascular disease risk.",

Objective\nTo investigate the prevalence of specific IgE to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) in adults, and its relation to alcohol consumption. Methods\nPopulation-based survey of 457 adults (218 abstainers, 195 light-to-moderate drinkers, 44 heavy drinkers). Specific IgE determinations included a CCD (MUXF3, the N-glycan of bromelain), pollens (Lolium perenne and Olea europaea), Hymenoptera venoms (Apis mellifera and Vespula spp.), and a mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus). We replicated these studies in an additional sample of alcoholics (n=138). Inhibition assays were performed in selected cases. Results\nIn the general population, 5.6% of individuals (95% confidence interval 3.5–7.6%) showed positive (0.35 kU/L) CCD-specific IgE. The levels of CCD-specific IgE were particularly high in heavy drinkers, who also showed a high prevalence of positive IgE to pollens and Hymenoptera venoms, doubling (at least) the prevalence found in alcohol abstainers and light-to-moderate drinkers. The presence of IgE to pollens and Hymenoptera venoms was closely correlated with the presence of CCD-specific IgE. These features were confirmed in the additional sample of alcoholics. Inhibition studies indicated a role of CCD interference in IgE positivity to pollen and Hymenoptera allergens in alcoholics. Conclusions\nCCD-specific IgE is prevalent in heavy drinkers, and is associated with positive IgE to pollens and Hymenoptera venoms. Specific IgE results should be interpreted with caution in heavy drinkers.",

This study reports gastroprotective effects of a cysteine precursor, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC), in experimental models of gastric secretion and ulceration. Acid secretion studies (volume and acidity) were undertaken in pylorus-ligated rats whereas the gastric lesions were induced by ethanol. Different groups of animals were treated with OTC (0, 100, 200 and 400mg/kg). The levels of gastric wall mucus, nonprotein sulfhydryls (NP-SH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured in the glandular stomach of rats following ethanol-induced gastric lesions. Both medium and high doses of OTC significantly reduced the volume and acidity of gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. Pretreatment with OTC significantly and dose-dependently attenuated the formation of ethanol-induced gastric lesion. OTC significantly protected the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced depletion of gastric wall mucus, NP-SH and MPO. The gastroprotective effects of OTC may be attributed to its ability to inhibit neutrophils activity and replenish GSH demand.",

		"abstract": "Induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol is one of the central pathways by which ethanol generates a state of oxidative stress in hepatocytes. To study the biochemical and toxicological actions of CYP2E1, our laboratory established HepG2 cell lines which constitutively overexpress CYP2E1 and characterized these cells with respect to ethanol toxicity. Addition of ethanol or an unsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic acid or iron was toxic to the CYP2E1-expressing cells but not control cells. This toxicity was associated with elevated lipid peroxidation and could be prevented by antioxidants and inhibitors of CYP2E1. Apoptosis occurred in the CYP2E1-expressing cells exposed to ethanol, arachidonic acid, or iron. Removal of GSH caused a loss of viability in the CYP2E1-expressing cells even in the absence of added toxin or pro-oxidant. This was associated with mitochondrial damage and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Low concentrations of iron and arachidonic acid synergistically interacted with CYP2E1 to produce cell toxicity, suggesting these nutrients may act as priming or sensitizing agents to alcohol-induced liver injury. Surprisingly, CYP2E1-expressing cells had elevated GSH levels, due to transcriptional activation of glutamate cysteine ligase. Similarly, levels of catalase, alpha-, and microsomal glutathione transferase were also increased, suggesting that upregulation of these antioxidant genes may reflect an adaptive mechanism to remove CYP2E1-derived oxidants. Using co-cultures, interaction between CYP2E1-derived diffusible mediators to activate collagen production in hepatic stellate cells was found. While it is likely that several mechanisms contribute to alcohol-induced liver injury, the linkage between CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, stellate cell activation, and GSH homeostasis may contribute to the toxic action of ethanol on the liver. HepG2 cell lines overexpressing CYP2E1 may be a valuable model to characterize the biochemical and toxicological properties of CYP2E1.",

		"abstract": "Drinking alcohol is a risk factor for breast cancer. Salsolinol (SAL) is endogenously formed by a condensation reaction of dopamine with acetaldehyde, a major ethanol metabolite, and SAL is detected in blood and urine after alcohol intake. We investigated the possibility that SAL can participate in tumor initiation and promotion by causing DNA damage and cell proliferation, leading to alcohol-associated mammary carcinogenesis. SAL caused oxidative DNA damage including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), in the presence of transition metal ions, such as Cu(II) and Fe(III)EDTA. Inhibitory effects of scavengers on SAL-induced DNA damage and the electron spin resonance study indicated the involvement of H2O2, which is generated via the SAL radical. Experiments on scavengers and site specificity of DNA damage suggested ·OH generation via a Fenton reaction and copper-peroxide complexes in the presence of Fe(III)EDTA and Cu(II), respectively. SAL significantly increased 8-oxodG formation in normal mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. In addition, SAL induced cell proliferation in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative MCF-10A cells, and the proliferation was inhibited by an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AG1478, suggesting that reactive oxygen species may participate in the proliferation of MCF-10A cells via EGFR activation. Furthermore, SAL induced proliferation in estrogen-sensitive breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and a surface plasmon resonance sensor revealed that SAL significantly increased the binding activity of ERα to the estrogen response element but not ERβ. In conclusion, SAL-induced DNA damage and cell proliferation may play a role in tumor initiation and promotion of multistage mammary carcinogenesis in relation to drinking alcohol.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol addiction is a serious public health problem that still needs more effective pharmacological treatment. A key factor in the development and maintenance of this disease is the advent of neuroadaptations in the mesocorticolimbic brain pathway upon chronic ethanol abuse. In general, these neuroadaptations are maladaptive and affect numerous neurotransmitter systems and intracellular molecules. One of these molecules is ΔFosB, a transcription factor that is altered after chronic drug use. Behavioural sensitization is a useful model for the study of the neuroadaptations related to addiction. Recent works have shown a role for the imbalance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the symptoms found in addicted people. In this sense, the treatment with N-acetylcysteine, a l-cysteine prodrug that acts by restoring extrasynaptic concentrations of glutamate through the activation of cystine-glutamate antiporter, has shown promising results in the treatment of addiction. Thus, an animal model of behavioural sensitization was used to evaluate the effects of N-acetylcysteine treatment in the behavioural and molecular alterations induced by chronic ethanol administration. Swiss mice were subject to 13 days of daily ethanol administration to induce behavioural sensitization. Two hours before each ethanol administration and locomotor activity evaluation, the animals received intraperitoneally N-acetylcysteine injections. Immediately after the last test session, their brains were removed for ΔFosB and cystine-glutamate antiporter quantification. It was found that N-acetylcysteine treatment blocked ethanol-induced behavioural sensitization, the increase of ΔFosB content in the prefrontal cortex, and its reduction in the nucleus accumbens. The results suggest a possible use of N-acetylcysteine in ethanol-related disorders.",

We hypothesized that alcohol metabolism by intestinal Cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) could alter circadian gene expression (Clock and Per2), resulting in alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. In vitro Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells were exposed to alcohol, and CYP2E1 protein, activity, and mRNA were measured. CYP2E1 expression was knocked down via siRNA and alcohol-induced hyperpermeability, and CLOCK and PER2 protein expression were measured. Caco-2 cells were also treated with alcohol or H2O2 with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC) anti-oxidant, and CLOCK and PER2 proteins were measured at 4 or 2 h. In vivo Cyp2e1 protein and mRNA were also measured in colon tissue from alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol increased CYP2E1 protein by 93% and enzyme activity by 69% in intestinal cells in vitro. Alcohol feeding also increased mouse colonic Cyp2e1 protein by 73%. mRNA levels of Cyp2e1 were not changed by alcohol in vitro or in mouse intestine. siRNA knockdown of CYP2E1 in Caco-2 cells prevented alcohol-induced hyperpermeability and induction of CLOCK and PER2 proteins. Alcohol-induced and H2O2-induced increases in intestinal cell CLOCK and PER2 were significantly inhibited by treatment with NAC. We concluded that our data support a novel role for intestinal CYP2E1 in alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability via a mechanism involving CYP2E1-dependent induction of oxidative stress and upregulation of circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2.",

		"abstract": "Context and objective. The aim of the study was to investigate whether treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is able to restore erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) content in workers exposed to lead. Additionally, we measured the leukocyte and erythrocyte activities of GSH-related enzymes, such as glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and estimated the influence of NAC administration on oxidative stress intensity, which was measured as the lipofuscin (LPS) level in erythrocytes. Methods. The exposed population consisted of 171 healthy males randomly divided into four groups. Workers in the first group (n = 49) were not administered any antioxidants, drugs, vitamins, or dietary supplements, while workers in the remaining groups were treated with NAC at three doses for 12 weeks (1 × 200 mg per day, 2 × 200 mg per day, and 2 × 400 mg per day). All workers continued to work during the study. The blood of all examined workers was drawn two times: at the beginning of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results and conclusion. Blood lead levels decreased significantly in all groups receiving NAC compared to those in baseline. Erythrocyte GSH concentrations were significantly elevated in workers receiving 400 and 800 mg of NAC compared to those in baseline by 5% and 6%, respectively. Erythrocyte G6PD activity was significantly elevated in workers receiving 200, 400, and 800 mg of NAC compared to those in baseline by 24%, 14%, and 14%, respectively. By contrast, there were no significant differences in leukocyte G6PD or leukocyte and erythrocyte glutathione reductase (GR) activities before and after treatment. Leukocyte GST activities decreased significantly after treatment in workers receiving 200 mg of NAC by 34%, while LPS levels decreased significantly in workers receiving 200, 400, and 800 mg of NAC compared to those in baseline by 5%, 15%, and 13%, respectively. In conclusion, NAC decreases oxidative stress in workers exposed to lead via stimulating GSH synthesis.",

		"abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been in clinical practice for several decades. It has been used as a mucolytic agent and for the treatment of numerous disorders including paracetamol intoxication, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, ischemia–reperfusion cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, chemotherapy-induced toxicity, HIV/AIDS, heavy metal toxicity and psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic and clinical applications of NAC are complex and still unclear. The present review is focused on the chemistry of NAC and its interactions and functions at the organ, tissue and cellular levels in an attempt to bridge the gap between its recognized biological activities and chemistry. The antioxidative activity of NAC as of other thiols can be attributed to its fast reactions with OH, NO2, CO3− and thiyl radicals as well as to restitution of impaired targets in vital cellular components. NAC reacts relatively slowly with superoxide, hydrogen-peroxide and peroxynitrite, which cast some doubt on the importance of these reactions under physiological conditions. The uniqueness of NAC is most probably due to efficient reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins thus altering their structures and disrupting their ligand bonding, competition with larger reducing molecules in sterically less accessible spaces, and serving as a precursor of cysteine for GSH synthesis. The outlined reactions only partially explain the diverse biological effects of NAC, and further studies are required for determining its ability to cross the cell membrane and the blood–brain barrier as well as elucidating its reactions with components of cell signaling pathways.",

		"abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamate-modulating agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been considered as a potential anti-addictive drug. Beneficial effects were reported for cocaine, cannabis, and tobacco addicts, but the effect of NAC in alcoholics or in alcohol animal models is unknown. The aggravation of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, has been associated with increased levels of serum corticosterone and leptin. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of NAC on anxiety, as well as corticosterone and leptin serum levels, after cessation of chronic alcohol treatment in rats. Male Wistar rats were treated with 2 g/kg ethanol, twice daily, by gavage for 30 days; control animals received an appropriate dose of glucose to balance caloric intake. Rats were treated for 4 days with NAC (60 and 90 mg/kg, intra-peritoneally [i.p.]) or saline after alcohol cessation. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, rats were exposed to a 5-min session in the open-field test (OF). Corticosterone and leptin serum levels were determined by ELISA in samples collected within 30 min after the OF. Results showed that rats were hypoactive (decreased rearing, peripheral, and total crossings), and that corticosterone and leptin levels were increased 5 days after alcohol cessation. Four days of NAC prevented the behavioral and biochemical changes brought about by alcohol cessation. We suggest that, in addition to the anti-addictive properties reported for other drugs of abuse, NAC is potentially useful in the management of alcohol withdrawal.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of l-cysteine on the acquisition and maintenance of oral EtOH self-administration and on the reinstatement of EtOH-drinking behavior in Wistar rats. Rats were pretreated intraperitoneally with saline or l-cysteine (20 and 40mg/kg) 30min before each acquisition trial, in an operant nose-poking paradigm where they were given the opportunity to orally self-administer tap water or EtOH (5–10% v/v). Further, to evaluate if l-cysteine reduces the acquired oral EtOH self-administration, we carried out an independent experiment in which rats were trained to self-administer EtOH (10%); after all groups of rats developed similarly stable oral EtOH self-administration, the effect of l-cysteine (0, 40, 60, 80 and 100mg/kg) was tested. An additional group of rats was pretreated with saline or l-cysteine (80mg/kg) and tested on reinstatement after EtOH extinction and, at the end of last reinstatement session, were utilized to measure blood and brain EtOH levels. The animals that had access to EtOH solution discriminated between the active and inactive nose-pokes and showed rates of active nose-pokes significantly higher than the tap water group. Furthermore, rats self-administering EtOH (10%) also demonstrated extinction behavior and gradually reinstated active nose-poke responding when EtOH was reintroduced. l-cysteine reduced both the acquisition and maintenance of oral EtOH self-administration. The reduced reinstatement of EtOH-drinking behavior was paralleled by a significant reduction of EtOH intake and correlated with blood and brain EtOH levels. The efficacy of l-cysteine on the various phases of alcohol drinking in rats, could represent an interesting pharmacological approach and could open a new line of research for the development of therapies to reduce EtOH intake in alcoholic patients.",

		"abstract": "Overproduction of reactive oxygen species associated with several diseases including sickle cell anaemia reduces the concentration of glutathione, a principal cellular antioxidant. Glutathione depletion in sickle erythrocytes increases their conversion to irreversible sickle cells that promote vaso-occlusion. Therapeutically, N-acetylcysteine partially restores glutathione concentrations but its mode of action is controversial. Following glutathione depletion, glutathione synthesis is limited by the supply of cysteine and it has been assumed that deacetylation of N-acetylcysteine within erythrocytes provides cysteine to accelerate glutathione production. To determine whether this is the case we studied the kinetics of transport and deacetylation of N-acetylcysteine. Uptake of N-acetylcysteine had a first order rate constant of 2.40±0.070min−1 and only saturated above 10mM. Inhibition experiments showed that 56% of N-acetylcysteine transport was via the anion exchange protein. Deacetylation, measured using 1H NMR, had a Km of 1.49±0.16mM and Vmax of 2.61±0.08μmolL−1min−1. Oral doses of N-acetylcysteine increase glutathione concentrations in sickle erythrocytes at plasma N-acetylcysteine concentrations of ∼10μM. At this concentration, calculated rates of N-acetylcysteine uptake and deacetylation were ∼5% of the rate required to maintain normal glutathione production. We concluded that on oral administration, intracellular deacetylation of N-acetylcysteine supplies little of the cysteine required for accelerated glutathione production. Instead, N-acetylcysteine acts by freeing bound cysteine in the plasma that then enters the erythrocytes. To be effective, intracellular cysteine precursors must be designed to enter erythrocytes rapidly and employ enzymes with high activity within erythrocytes to liberate the cysteine.",

		"abstract": "N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) has long been used therapeutically for the treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose, acting as a precursor for the substrate (l-cysteine) in synthesis of hepatic glutathione (GSH) depleted through drug conjugation. Other therapeutic uses of NAC have also emerged, including the alleviation of clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis through cysteine-mediated disruption of disulfide cross-bridges in the glycoprotein matrix in mucus. More recently, however, a wide range of clinical studies have reported on the use of NAC as an antioxidant, most notably in the protection against contrast-induced nephropathy and thrombosis. The results from these studies are conflicting and a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the merits or otherwise of NAC in the antioxidant setting. This review seeks to re-evaluate the mechanism of action of NAC as a precursor for GSH synthesis in the context of its activity as an “antioxidant”. Results from recent studies are examined to establish whether the pre-requisites for effective NAC-induced antioxidant activity (i.e. GSH depletion and the presence of functional metabolic pathways for conversion of NAC to GSH) have received adequate consideration in the interpretation of the data. A key conclusion is a reinforcement of the concept that NAC should not be considered to be a powerful antioxidant in its own right: its strength is the targeted replenishment of GSH in deficient cells and it is likely to be ineffective in cells replete in GSH.",

		"abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12), an enzyme responsible for degradation of extracellular matrix, plays an important role in the progression of various diseases, including inflammation and fibrosis. Although most of those are pathogenic conditions induced by ethanol ingestion, the effect of ethanol on MMP-12 has not been explored. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ethanol on MMP-12 expression and its potential mechanisms in macrophages. Here, we demonstrated that ethanol treatment increased MMP-12 expression in primary murine peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 macrophages at both mRNA and protein levels. Ethanol treatment also significantly increased the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) oxidase and the expression of NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). Pretreatment with an anti-oxidant (N-acetyl cysteine) or a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI)) prevented ethanol-induced MMP-12 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of Nox2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented ethanol-induced ROS production and MMP-12 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages, indicating a critical role for Nox2 in ethanol-induced intracellular ROS production and MMP-12 expression in macrophages. We also showed that ethanol-induced Nox2 expression was suppressed by transient transfection with dominant negative IκB-α plasmid or pretreatment with Bay 11-7082, a selective inhibitor of NF-κB, in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, ethanol-induced Nox2 expression was also attenuated by treatment with a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, suggesting involvement of p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway in ethanol-induced Nox2 expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ethanol treatment elicited increase in MMP-12 expression via increase in ROS production derived from Nox2 in macrophages.",

Electron microscopy was used to evaluate histological changes in liver tissue at both 6th and 24th hour.\nRESULTS: Histopathological damage was found to be higher in methanol-induced intoxicated rats compared with the controls. Extensive tubules of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, increased mitochondria, increased primary lysosomes and some marked openings of bile canaliculus were distinguished. Melatonin administration prevents liver injury especially in early hours and although not as effective as melatonin, NAC also prevents liver injury.\nCONCLUSIONS: Melatonin is much more efficient than NAC, as well as significantly greater hepatoprotective effect against the liver injury secondary to the methanol intoxication.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic cardiomyopathy represents a major clinical complication in chronic alcoholics. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that acute and chronic exposure of liver cells to ethanol results in a major loss of cellular Mg2+ as a result of alcohol oxidation. We investigated whether exposure to ethanol induces a similar Mg2+ loss in cardiac cells. The results indicate that chronic exposure to a 6% ethanol-containing diet depleted cardiac myocytes of >25% of their cellular Mg2+ content. Acute ethanol exposure, instead, induced a time- and dose-dependent manner of Mg2+ extrusion from perfused hearts and collagenase-dispersed cardiac ventricular myocytes. Pretreatment with chlormethiazole prevented ethanol-induced Mg2+ loss to a large extent, suggesting a role of ethanol oxidation via cyP4502E1 in the process. Magnesium extrusion across the sarcolemma occurred via the amiloride-inhibited Na+/Mg2+ exchanger. Taken together, our data indicate that Mg2+ extrusion also occurs in cardiac cells exposed to ethanol as a result of alcohol metabolism by cyP4502E1. The extrusion, which is mediated by the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, only occurs at doses of ethanol ≥0.1%, and depends on ethanol-induced decline in cellular ATP. The significance of Mg2+ extrusion for the onset of alcoholic cardiomyopathy remains to be elucidated.",

		"abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in inflammatory and degradative processes in several diseases. The study aims to explore the mechanism of MMP-9 regulation in alcohol-induced acute liver injury and its protection by melatonin in mice. Alcohol-induced acute liver injury was induced in female Balb/C mice by ethanol administration and protection studies were carried out with a well-known antioxidant molecule, melatonin. Degree of liver injury was monitored by histological and biochemical analysis of liver tissues. Oral administration of ethanol in mouse caused significant increase in alanine amino transferase (ALT) activity in serum. Depletion of glutathione and enhancement of lipid peroxidation as well as protein oxidation was observed in liver tissues following ethanol treatment. However, melatonin exhibited potent hepatoprotective activity by inhibiting ALT activity and oxidative stress. Additionally, MMP-9 expression was increased by ethanol in a dose and time dependent manner in liver tissue and serum. Increased secretion of proMMP-9 was strongly correlated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL6. Melatonin showed hepatoprotective role by downregulation of MMP-9 and upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP-1) expression in liver tissue. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB, plays an important role in inducing inflammatory genes during oxidative stress, thus the role of NF-κB in ethanol-induced liver injury was investigated. Ethanol induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and increased degradation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) in liver tissues. Moreover, ethanol-induced NF-κB translocation into nucleus was inhibited significantly by melatonin. This is the first study to elucidate the induction of MMP-9 expression by NF-κB-dependent pathway in ethanol-induced acute liver injury in mice. This study also identifies the novel role of melatonin in hepatoprotection via MMP-9 down regulation.",

		"abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine pro-drug and glutathione precursor has been used in therapeutic practices for several decades, as a mucolytic agent and for the treatment of numerous disorders including paracetamol intoxication. There is a growing interest concerning the beneficial effects of NAC against the early stages of toxicity-induced by pesticides. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic and clinical applications of NAC are not fully understood. In this review we aimed to focus on the protective effects of NAC against oxidative stress caused by pesticide in many organs. The possible mechanisms of action may be associated to its antioxidant properties. The anti-oxidative activity of NAC has been attributed to the fast reaction with free radicals as well as the restitution of reduced glutathione (GSH).",

		"abstract": "Alcoholism has been associated with a wide range of pathologic conditions, including alcoholic heart disease (AHD). Because AHD may be associated with oxidative stress, antioxidant compounds, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could be useful to control the damage done by alcohol (ethanol) consumption. To investigate the NAC effects on alcoholism and alcohol abstinence, initially, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: (C, N=6) given standard chow and water; (E, N=24) receiving standard chow and aqueous ethanol solution in semi-voluntary research. After 30 days of ethanol-exposure, (E) group was divided into four subgroups (N=6/group):(E-E) continued drinking 30% ethanol-solution; (E-NAC) drinking ethanol-solution containing 2g/L NAC; (AB) changed ethanol solution to water; (AB-NAC) changed ethanol to aqueous solution of 2g/L NAC. After 15 days of the E-group division, E-E rats had lower body weight and feed efficiency, as well as higher energy-expenditure resting metabolic rate (RMR)/body weight and VO2 consumption/surface area. These calorimetric changes were reflected on the cardiac tissue. E-E rats had higher heart weight/body weight ratio and myocardial lipid hydroperoxide (LH), indicating AHD with hypertrophy and oxidative stress. Myocardial superoxide dismutase was higher, whereas glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-peroxidase) was lower in E-E rats than in C. The higher myocardial hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase (OHADH), OHADH/citrate synthase (CS), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/CS in E-E rats indicated higher fatty acid degradation relative to aerobic metabolism predisposing the lipotoxicity. AB rats had lower RMR/body weight than E-E, normalized myocardial oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. E-NAC and AB-NAC had lower RMR/body weight, myocardial LH, LDH/CS, and higher GSH-peroxidase than E-E and AB, respectively, demonstrating lower oxidative stress and higher myocardial carbohydrate oxidation. In conclusion, the present study brought new insights on alcohol consumption and AHD because ethanol-exposure enhanced energy-expenditure and induced a number of calorimetric changes, which were reflected in body weight and myocardial lipotoxicity. NAC preventing ethanol-induced calorimetric changes and reducing myocardial oxidative stress enhanced carbohydrate oxidation, thus optimizing myocardial energy metabolism in both alcoholic and abstinence condition.",

		"abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with acute ethanol-induced liver damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a glutathione (GSH) precursor and direct antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAC on acute ethanol-induced liver damage. Female ICR mice were administered by gavage with a single dose of ethanol (6g/kg). NAC was administered in two different modes. In mode A, mice were injected with different doses of NAC at 30min before ethanol. In mode B, mice were injected with different doses of NAC at 4h after ethanol. Acute ethanol-induced liver damage was estimated by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and histopathological changes. Result showed that a single dose of ethanol (6g/kg) caused a significant increase in serum ALT activity, followed by microvesicular steatosis and necrosis in mouse liver. Pretreatment with NAC significantly protected against acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-independent manner. Correspondingly, pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated acute ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion and inhibited hepatic TNF-α mRNA expression. By contrast, post-treatment with NAC aggravated ethanol-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation and worsened acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, NAC has a dual effect on acute ethanol-induced liver damage. Pretreatment with NAC prevent from acute ethanol-induced liver damage via counteracting ethanol-induced oxidative stress. When administered after ethanol, NAC might behave as a pro-oxidant and aggravate acute ethanol-induced liver damage.",

		"abstract": "Acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of ethanol, has been implicated in several behavioural actions of alcohol, including its reinforcing effects. Recently, we reported that l-cysteine, a sequestrating agent of ACD, reduced oral ethanol self-administration and that ACD was orally self-administered. This study examined the effects of l-cysteine pre-treatment during the acquisition and maintenance phases of ACD (0.2%) self-administration as well as on the deprivation effect after ACD extinction and on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. In a separate PR schedule of reinforcement, the effect of l-cysteine was assessed on the break-point produced by ethanol (10%). Furthermore, we tested the effect of l-cysteine on saccharin (0.2%) reinforcement. Wistar rats were trained to self-administer ACD by nose poking on a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule in 30-min daily sessions. Responses on an active nose-poke caused delivery of ACD solution, whereas responses on an inactive nose-poke had no consequences. l-cysteine reduced the acquisition (40 mg/kg), the maintenance and the deprivation effect (100 mg/kg) of ACD self-administration. Furthermore, at the same dose, l-cysteine (120 mg/kg) decreased both ACD and ethanol break point. In addition, l-cysteine was unable to suppress the different responses for saccharin, suggesting that its effect did not relate to an unspecific decrease in a general motivational state. Compared to saline, l-cysteine did not modify responses on inactive nose-pokes, suggesting an absence of a non-specific behavioural activation. Taken together, these results could support the hypotheses that ACD possesses reinforcing properties and l-cysteine reduces motivation to self-administer ACD.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol-mediated liver injury is associated with changes in the level of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH). It is interesting to investigate if the changes in intracellular GSH level through exogenous agents affect the intracellular cysteine content and the protein adduct formation indicative of oxidative insult in chronic alcohol treated liver cells. In VL-17A cells treated with 2 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or 0.1 mM ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) plus 100 mM ethanol, an increase in cysteine concentration which was accompanied by decreases in hydroxynonenal (HNE) and glutathionylated protein adducts were observed. Pretreatment of 100 mM ethanol treated VL-17A cells with 0.4 mM buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or 1 mM diethyl maleate (DEM) had opposite effects. Thus, altered GSH level through exogenous agents may either potentiate or ameliorate chronic alcohol-mediated protein adduct formation and change the cysteine level in chronic alcohol treated VL-17A cells. The gene expression of non-treated and ethanol-treated hepatocytes in 2 microarray datasets was also compared to locate differentially expressed genes involved in cysteine metabolism. The study demonstrates that increased protein adducts formation and changes in cysteine concentration occur under chronic alcohol condition in liver cells which may increase alcohol-mediated oxidative injury.",

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has antioxidant properties; as a sulphydryl donor, it contributes to the regeneration of glutathione and it acts through a direct reaction with hydroxyl radicals. In this study we investigated a possible beneficial effect of NAC on some of the free radical related parameters. Twenty four male Wistar rats were divided in to three groups and were given ethanol (Group 1), ethanol and NAC (Group 2) and isocaloric dextrose (Group 3). Ethanol and NAC were given intragastrically at doses of 6 g/kg/day and 1 g/kg/day, respectively. Our results show that chronic ethanol intake elicits statistically significant increase in MDA and NO levels and decrease in SOD and GSH levels in both plasma and brain (p<0.001). GPx levels decreased in erythrocytes (p<0.001). CAT activity showed significant decrease only in brain samples (p<0.001). NAC administration effectively restores the above results to nearly normal levels. Therefore we suggest that reactive free radicals are, at least partly, involved in the ethanol-induced injury of brain cells and NAC mitigate the toxic effects of ethanol on the oxidant-antioxidant system of rat plasma and brain.",

In the present study, the hypothesis that co-administration of NAC and EtOH via liquid diet on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy in mice would reduce EtOH's teratogenicity was tested. For this work, adult non-pregnant female mice were acclimated to a liquid diet containing EtOH for 16 days, withdrawn from the EtOH, bred and then returned to the liquid diet containing 4.8% EtOH and/or either 0.5 or 1 mg NAC/ml diet on their 7th and 8th days of pregnancy. At the concentrations employed, the mice received NAC dosages of approximately 300 or 600 mg/kg/day and achieved peak blood EtOH levels (BEC) that averaged approximately 200 mg/dl. There was no difference in BEC between the EtOH alone and EtOH plus 600 mg/kg NAC group. Following maternal euthanasia, gestational day (GD) 14 fetuses were removed, fixed, weighed and examined for the presence and severity of ocular abnormalities, a readily assessed endpoint that results from GD 7 and 8 EtOH exposures. While the lower dosage of NAC (300 mg/kg) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of ocular defects in both the left and right eyes, this reduction was not statistically significant. However, doubling the NAC concentration did yield a significant change; as compared to the group treated with EtOH alone, the incidence of ocular abnormalities was diminished by 22%. These results show the potential of an orally administered compound with proven clinical efficacy to reduce EtOH's teratogenic effects and support the premise that oxidative damage plays an important mechanistic role in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.",

		"abstract": "Background:  Acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of ethanol (EtOH) appears to be involved in many of the psychoactive effects of its parent compound, including EtOH-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby suggesting that ACD may participate in EtOH motivational properties. l-cysteine (Lcys), a thiol compound sequestering ACD, is able to prevent the behavioral effect of EtOH and ACD. Here we show that the stimulatory effect of both EtOH and ACD on the mesolimbic DA system is prevented by Lcys pretreatment. Methods:  Male Wistar rats were implanted with a microdialysis probe in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAccs), and pretreated intraperitoneally with Lcys (30 mg/kg) before intragastric administration of EtOH (1 g/kg) or ACD (20 mg/kg) or before intraperitoneal administration of morphine (2.5 mg/kg). Results:  Pretreatment with Lcys prevented both EtOH and ACD-induced DA release in the NAccs without influencing morphine-induced DA release, suggesting that Lcys specifically affects EtOH-induced DA release possibly through ACD sequestering. Conclusions:  Our results underscore the role of ACD on EtOH-induced stimulation of DA mesoaccumbens system and support the notion that thiol compounds such as Lcys, by modulating EtOH-derived ACD bioavailability, would blunt EtOH rewarding properties.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol abuse is a major cause of pancreatitis. However alcohol toxicity has not been fully elucidated in the pancreas and little is known about the effect of alcohol on pancreatic ducts. We report the molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced damage of pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Ethanol treatment for 1, 4, and 24 h resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The ethanol-induced cell damage was mainly apoptosis due to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activation of caspase-3 enzyme. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated these cellular responses and reduced cell death significantly, suggesting a critical role for ROS. Acetaldehyde, a metabolic product of alcohol dehydrogenase, induced significant cell death, depolarization of MMP, and caspase-3 activation as ethanol and this damage was also averted by NAC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression of several subtypes of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data confirmed the accumulation of acetaldehyde in ethanol-treated cells, suggesting that acetaldehyde formation can contribute to alcohol toxicity in PDEC. Finally, ethanol increased the leakage of PDEC monolayer which was again attenuated by NAC. In conclusion, ethanol induces apoptosis of PDEC and thereby may contribute to the development of alcohol-induced pancreatitis.",

		"abstract": "This review analyzes literature that describes the behavioral effects of 2 metabolites of ethanol (EtOH): acetaldehyde and salsolinol (a condensation product of acetaldehyde and dopamine) generated in the brain. These metabolites are self-administered into specific brain areas by animals, showing strong reinforcing effects. A wealth of evidence shows that EtOH, a drug consumed to attain millimolar concentrations, generates brain metabolites that are reinforcing at micromolar and nanomolar concentrations. Salsolinol administration leads to marked increases in voluntary EtOH intake, an effect inhibited by mu-opioid receptor blockers. In animals that have ingested EtOH chronically, the maintenance of alcohol intake is no longer influenced by EtOH metabolites, as intake is taken over by other brain systems. However, after EtOH withdrawal brain acetaldehyde has a major role in promoting binge-like drinking in the condition known as the “alcohol deprivation effect”; a condition seen in animals that have ingested alcohol chronically, are deprived of EtOH for extended periods, and are allowed EtOH re-access. The review also analyzes the behavioral effects of acetate, a metabolite that enters the brain and is responsible for motor incoordination at low doses of EtOH. Also discussed are the paradoxical effects of systemic acetaldehyde. Overall, evidence strongly suggests that brain-generated EtOH metabolites play a major role in the early (“first-hit”) development of alcohol reinforcement and in the generation of relapse-like drinking.",

		"volume": "47",

		"abstract": "Previously we have shown that chronic alcohol intake causes alcohol-induced ciliary dysfunction (AICD), leading to non-responsive airway cilia. AICD likely occurs through the downregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, protein kinase G (PKG) and protein kinase A (PKA). Studies by others have shown that dietary supplementation with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and procysteine prevent other alcohol-induced lung complications. This led us to hypothesize that dietary supplementation with NAC or procysteine prevents AICD. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice drank an alcohol/water solution (20% w/v) ad libitum for 6 weeks and were concurrently fed dietary supplements of either NAC or procysteine. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in mice tracheas, and PKG/PKA responsiveness to β-agonists and NOx levels were measured from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Long-term alcohol drinking reduced CBF, PKG and PKA responsiveness to β-agonists, and lung NOx levels in BAL fluid. In contrast, alcohol-drinking mice fed NAC or procysteine sustained ciliary function and PKG and PKA responsiveness to β-agonists. However, BAL NO levels remained low despite antioxidant supplementation. We also determined that removal of alcohol from the drinking water for as little as 1 week restored ciliary function, but not PKG and PKA responsiveness to β-agonists. We conclude that dietary supplementation with NAC or procysteine protects against AICD. In addition, alcohol removal for 1 week restores cilia function independent of PKG and PKA activity. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of antioxidants to prevent damage to airway mucociliary functions in chronic alcohol-drinking individuals.",

		"abstract": "Background: Hepatocytes metabolize the vast majority of ingested ethanol. This metabolic activity results in hepatic toxicity and impairs the ability of hepatocytes to replicate. Previous work by our group has shown that ethanol metabolism results in a G2/M cell cycle arrest. The intent of these studies was to discern the roles of acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen, two of the major by-products of ethanol metabolism, in the G2/M cell cycle arrest. Methods: To investigate the role of ethanol metabolites in the cell cycle arrest, VA-13 and VL-17A cells were used. These are recombinant Hep G2 cells that express alcohol dehydrogenase or alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 2E1, respectively. Cells were cultured with or without ethanol, lacking or containing the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or trolox, for three days. Cellular accumulation was monitored by the DNA content of the cultures. The accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2 in the inactive phosphorylated form (p-Cdc2) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were determined by immunoblot analysis. Results: Cultures maintained in the presence of ethanol demonstrated a G2/M cell cycle arrest that was associated with a reduction in DNA content and increased levels of p-Cdc2 and p21, compared with cells cultured in its absence. Inclusion of antioxidants in the ethanol containing media was unable to rescue the cells from the cell cycle arrest or these ethanol metabolism-mediated effects. Additionally, culturing the cells in the presence of acetaldehyde alone resulted in increased levels of p-Cdc2 and p21. Conclusions: Acetaldehyde produced during ethanol oxidation has a major role in the ethanol metabolism-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest, and the concurrent accumulation of p21 and p-Cdc2. Although reactive oxygen species are thought to have a significant role in ethanol-induced hepatocellular damage, they may have a less important role in the inability of hepatocytes to replace dead or damaged cells.",

Alcohol-induced steatohepatitis promotes synthesis and accumulation of ceramides and other toxic lipids that cause insulin resistance.

Chow-fed controls were studied in parallel. Liver tissues were used for histopathology, cytokine activation, and insulin/IGF-1 signaling assays.\n\nResults\nWe observed significant positive trends of increasing severity of steatohepatitis (P=0.016) with accumulation of neutral lipid (P=0.0002) and triglycerides (P=0.0004) from chow to control, to the ethanol diet, irrespective of NAC treatment. In ethanol-fed rats, NAC reduced inflammation, converted the steatosis from a predominantly micro-vesicular to a mainly macro-vesicular histological pattern, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, ceramide load, and acid sphingomyelinase activity, and increased expression of IGF-1 receptor and IGF-2 in liver. However, NAC did not abrogate ethanol-mediated impairments in signaling through insulin/IGF-1 receptors, IRS-1, Akt, GSK-3β, or p70S6K, nor did it significantly reduce pro-ceramide or GM3 ganglioside gene expression in liver.\n\nConclusions\nAnti-oxidant treatments reduce the severity of chronic alcohol-related steatohepatitis, possibly due to decreased expression of inflammatory mediators and ceramide accumulation, but they do not restore insulin/IGF-1 signaling in liver, most likely due to persistent elevation of GM3 synthase expression. Effective treatment of alcohol-related steatohepatitis most likely requires dual targeting of oxidative stress and insulin/IGF resistance.",

		"abstract": "The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether CYP2E1 plays a role in binge-ethanol induced steatosis and if autophagy impacts CYP2E1-mediated hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and fatty liver formation produced by ethanol. Wild type (WT), CYP2E1 knockin (KI) and CYP2E1 knockout (KO) mice were gavaged with 3g/kg body wt ethanol twice a day for four days. This treatment caused fatty liver, elevation of CYP2E1 and oxidative stress in WT and KI mice but not KO mice. Autophagy was impaired in ethanol-treated KI mice compared to KO mice as reflected by a decline in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and lower total LC-3 and Beclin-1 levels coupled to increases in P62, pAKT/AKT and mTOR. Inhibition of macroautophagy by administration of 3-methyladenine enhanced the binge ethanol hepatotoxicity, steatosis and oxidant stress in CYP2E1 KI, but not CYP2E1 KO mice. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin blunted the elevated steatosis produced by binge ethanol. Treatment of HepG2 E47 cells which express CYP2E1 with 100 mM ethanol for 8 days increased fat accumulation and oxidant stress but decreased autophagy. Ethanol had no effect on these reactions in HepG2 C34 cells which do not express CYP2E1. Inhibition of autophagy elevated ethanol toxicity, lipid accumulation and oxidant stress in the E47, but not C34 cells. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, and CYP2E1 inhibitor chlormethiazole blunted these effects of ethanol. These results indicate that CYP2E1 plays an important role in binge ethanol-induced fatty liver. We propose that CYP2E1-derived reactive oxygen species inhibit autophagy, which subsequently causes accumulation of lipid droplets. Inhibition of autophagy promotes binge ethanol induced hepatotoxicity, steatosis and oxidant stress via CYP2E1.",

		"abstract": "Previous in vitro data suggest that ethanol (EtOH) activates NADPH oxidase (Nox) in osteoblasts leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This might be a mechanism underlying inhibition of bone formation and increased bone resorption observed in vivo after EtOH exposure. In a rat model in which cycling females were infused intragastrically with EtOH-containing liquid diets, EtOH significantly decreased bone formation and stimulated osteoblast-dependent osteoclast differentiation. These effects were reversed by exogenous 17-β-estradiol coadministration. Moreover, coadministration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, or diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a specific Nox inhibitor, also abolished chronic EtOH-associated bone loss. EtOH treatment up-regulated mRNA levels of Nox1, 2, 4, and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), an essential factor for differentiation of osteoclasts in bone. Protein levels of Nox4, a major Nox isoform expressed in nonphagocytic cells, was also up-regulated by EtOH in bone. 17-β-Estradiol, NAC, and DPI were able to normalize EtOH-induced up-regulation of Nox and RANKL. In vitro experiments demonstrated that EtOH directly up-regulated Nox expression in osteoblasts. Pretreatment of osteoblasts with DPI eliminated EtOH-induced RANKL promoter activity. Furthermore, EtOH induced RANKL gene expression, and RANKL promoter activation in osteoblasts was ROS-dependent. These data suggest that inhibition of Nox expression and activity may be critical for prevention of chronic EtOH-induced osteoblast-dependent bone loss.",

		"abstract": "The relationship between ethanol induced oxidative stress and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3AcK9) remains unknown and was therefore investigated in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Cells were treated with ethanol and a select group of pharmacological agents and the status of H3AcK9 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were monitored. When hepatocytes were exposed to ethanol (50 mM, 24 hr) in the presence of N-acetyl cystein (ROS reducer) or dietary antioxidants (quercetin, resveratrol), or NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, ethanol induced increases in ROS and H3AcK9, both were significantly reduced. On the other hand, l-buthionine-sulfoximine (ROS inducer) and inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I (rotenone) and III (antimycin) increased ethanol induced H3AcK9 (p<0.01). Oxidative stress also affected ethanol induced alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) mRNA expression.

		"abstract": "Binge alcohol drinking induces hepatic steatosis. Recent studies showed that chronic ethanol-induced fatty liver was, at least in part, CYP2E1 dependent. The mechanism of acute alcohol induced steatosis and whether CYP2E1 plays any role is still unclear. Increasing oxidative stress by alcohol can activate the JNK MAP kinase signaling pathway, suggesting that JNK might be a target for prevention of alcohol induced steatosis. We used CYP2E1 knockout (KO) mice, a JNK inhibitor, and JNK1 or JNK2 knockout mice to test the role of CYP2E1, JNK, and the individual role of JNK1 and JNK2 in acute alcohol-induced steatosis. In wild type (WT) mice, acute alcohol activates CYP2E1 and increases oxidative stress, which reciprocally increases activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Acute alcohol–induced fatty liver and oxidative stress was blunted in CYP2E1 KO mice and by the JNK inhibitor in WT mice. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine decreased the acute alcohol induced oxidative stress, activation of JNK and the steatosis but not the activation of CYP2E1. Acute alcohol decreased autophagy and increased expression of SREBP, effects blocked by the JNK inhibitor. Acute alcohol–induced fatty liver was the same in either JNK1 or JNK2 KO mice as WT mice, thus either JNK1 or JNK2 per se is sufficient in induction of steatosis by acute alcohol.",

		"abstract": "AIM: There is increasing evidence that alcohol-induced liver damage may be associated with increased oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate free-radical scavenger effect of n-acetylcysteine in rats intragastrically fed with ethanol., METHODS: Twenty-four rats divided into three groups were fed with ethanol (6 g/kg/d, Group 1), ethanol and n-acetylcysteine (1 g/kg, Group 2), or isocaloric dextrose (control group, Group 3) for 4 wk. Then animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia, intracardiac blood and liver tissues were obtained. Measurements were performed both in serum and in homogenized liver tissues. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was measured by TBARS method. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were studied by commercial kits. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: ALT and AST in Group 1 (154 U/L and 302 U/L, respectively) were higher than those in Group 2 (94 U/L and 155 U/L) and Group 3 (99 U/L and 168 U/L) (P = 0.001 for both). Serum and tissue levels of MDA in Group 1 (1.84 nmol/mL and 96 nmol/100 mg-protein) were higher than Group 2 (0.91 nmol/mL and 64 nmol/100 mg-protein) and Group 3 (0.94 nmol/mL and 49 nmol/100 mg-protein) (P < 0.001 for both). On the other hand, serum GSH-Px level in Group 1 (8.21 U/g-Hb) was lower than Group 2 (16 U/g-Hb) and Group 3 (16 U/g-Hb) (P < 0.001). Serum and liver tissue levels of SOD in Group 1 (11 U/mL and 26 U/100 mg-protein) were lower than Group 2 (18 U/mL and 60 U/100 mg-protein) and Group 3 (20 U/mL and 60 U/100 mg-protein) (P < 0.001 for both)., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that ethanol-induced liver damage is associated with oxidative stress, and co-administration of n-acetylcysteine attenuates this damage effectively in rat model.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the biosynthesis of NAC to GSH using a novel stable isotope-labeled technique, and investigate the pharmacodynamics of NAC in vivo. Female wild-type mice were given a single intravenous bolus dose of 150mg kg−1 stable-labeled NAC. Plasma, red blood cells (RBC), and brain tissues were collected at predesignated time points. Stable-labeled NAC and its metabolite GSH (both labeled and unlabeled forms) were quantified in blood and brain samples. Molar ratios of the reduced and oxidized forms of GSH (GSH divided by glutathione disulfide, redox ratio) were also determined. The elimination phase half-life of NAC was approximately 34min. Both labeled and unlabeled GSH in RBC were found to increase; however, the area under the curve above baseline (AUCb0–280) of labeled GSH was only 1% of the unlabeled form. These data indicate that NAC is not a direct precursor of GSH. In addition, NAC has prolonged effects in brain even when the drug has been eliminated from systemic circulation. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 104:2619–2626, 2015",

		"abstract": "Over the last quarter century, researchers have peered into the living human brain to develop and refine mechanistic accounts of alcohol-induced behavior, as well as neurobiological mechanisms for development and maintenance of addiction. These in vivo neuroimaging studies generally show that acute alcohol administration affects brain structures implicated in motivation and behavior control, and that chronic intoxication is correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in these same structures, where some elements of these decrements normalize with extended sobriety. In this review, we will summarize recent findings about acute human brain responses to alcohol using neuroimaging techniques, and how they might explain behavioral effects of alcohol intoxication. We then briefly address how chronic alcohol intoxication (as inferred from cross-sectional differences between various drinking populations and controls) may yield individual brain differences between drinking subjects that may confound interpretation of acute alcohol administration effects.",

		"abstract": "During alcohol intoxication, the human brain increases metabolism of acetate and decreases metabolism of glucose as energy substrate. Here we hypothesized that chronic heavy drinking facilitates this energy substrate shift both for baseline and stimulation conditions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of alcohol intoxication (0.75 g/kg alcohol vs placebo) on brain glucose metabolism during video stimulation (VS) versus when given with no stimulation (NS), in 25 heavy drinkers (HDs) and 23 healthy controls, each of whom underwent four PET-18FDG scans. We showed that resting whole-brain glucose metabolism (placebo-NS) was lower in HD than controls (13%, p = 0.04); that alcohol (compared with placebo) decreased metabolism more in HD (20 ± 13%) than controls (9 ± 11%, p = 0.005) and in proportion to daily alcohol consumption (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) but found that alcohol did not reduce the metabolic increases in visual cortex from VS in either group. Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10 ± 12%) compared with NS in both groups (15 ± 13%, p = 0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.",

		"abstract": "Background\nIndividual differences in subjective response to alcohol, as measured by laboratory-based alcohol challenge, have been identified as a candidate phenotypic risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Two models have been developed to explain the role of subjective response to alcohol, but predictions from the two models are contradictory, and theoretical consensus is lacking.\n\nMethods\nThis investigation used a meta-analytic approach to review the accumulated evidence from alcohol-challenge studies of subjective response as a risk factor. Data from 32 independent samples (total N = 1,314) were aggregated to produce quantitative estimates of the effects of risk group status (i.e., positive family history of AUDs or heavier alcohol consumption) on subjective response.\n\nResults\nAs predicted by the Low Level of Response Model (LLRM), family history positive groups experienced reduced overall subjective response relative to family history negative groups. This effect was most evident among men, with family history positive men responding more than half a standard deviation less than family history negative men. In contrast, consistent with the Differentiator Model (DM), heavier drinkers of both genders responded 0.4 standard deviations less on measures of sedation than did lighter drinkers but nearly half a standard deviation more on measures of stimulation, with the stimulation difference appearing most prominent on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve.\n\nConclusions\nThe accumulated results from three decades of family history comparisons provide considerable support for the LLRM. In contrast, results from typical consumption comparisons were largely consistent with predictions of the DM.

		"abstract": "Alcohol intoxication results in marked reductions in brain glucose metabolism, which we hypothesized reflect not just its GABAergic enhancing effects but also metabolism of acetate as an alternative brain energy source. To test this hypothesis we separately assessed the effects of alcohol intoxication on brain glucose and acetate metabolism using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We found that alcohol intoxication significantly decreased whole brain glucose metabolism (measured with FDG) with the largest decrements in cerebellum and occipital cortex and the smallest in thalamus. In contrast, alcohol intoxication caused a significant increase in [1-11C]acetate brain uptake (measured as standard uptake value, SUV), with the largest increases occurring in cerebellum and the smallest in thalamus. In heavy alcohol drinkers [1-11C]acetate brain uptake during alcohol challenge trended to be higher than in occasional drinkers (p <0.06) and the increases in [1-11C]acetate uptake in cerebellum with alcohol were positively associated with the reported amount of alcohol consumed (r=0.66, p<0.01). Our findings corroborate a reduction of brain glucose metabolism during intoxication and document an increase in brain acetate uptake. The opposite changes observed between regional brain metabolic decrements and regional increases in [1-11C]acetate uptake support the hypothesis that during alcohol intoxication the brain may rely on acetate as an alternative brain energy source and provides preliminary evidence that heavy alcohol exposures may facilitate the use of acetate as an energy substrate. These findings raise the question of the potential therapeutic benefits that increasing plasma acetate concentration (ie ketogenic diets) may have in alcoholics undergoing alcohol detoxification.",

J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3448–3455, 2011—Creatine (Cr), or methyl guanidine–acetic acid, can be either ingested from exogenous sources, such as fish or meat, or produced endogenously by the body, primarily in the liver. It is used as an ergogenic aid to improve muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Heretofore, Cr's positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) on oxidative stress response and oxidative DNA damage in male athletes and whether supplementation with Cr could negate any observed differences. Twenty-seven resistance-trained men were randomly divided into a Cr supplementation group (the Cr group [21.6 ± 3.6 years], taking 4 × 5 g Cr monohydrate per day) or a placebo (PL) supplementation group (the PL group [21.2 ± 3.2 years], taking 4 × 5 g maltodextrin per day). A double-blind research design was employed for a 7-day supplementation period. Before and after the seventh day of supplementation, the subjects performed an RE protocol (7 sets of 4 exercises using 60–90 1 repetition maximum) in the flat pyramid loading pattern. Blood and urine samples taken before, immediately, and 24-hour postexercise were analyzed for plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion. Before the supplementation period, a significant increase in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA levels was observed after RE. The Cr supplementation induces a significant increase in athletics performance, and it attenuated the changes observed in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA. These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE.",

Lately, creatine’s positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in literature and, more recently, creatine has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects. Oxidatively-challenged DNA was analysed to show possible protective effects of creatine. Acellular and cellular studies were carried out. Acellular assays, performed using molecular approaches, showed that creatine protects circular and linear DNA from oxidative attacks. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs from oxidatively-injured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were analyzed. Creatine supplementation showed significant genoprotective activity on mitochondrial DNA. This evidence suggests that creatine may play an important role in mitochondrial genome stability in that it could normalize mitochondrial mutagenesis and its functional consequences. Thus, creatine supplementation could be used to prevent or ameliorate diseases related to mitochondrial DNA mutations, and possibly to delay aging.",

		"abstract": "Despite the widespread availability and use of dietary supplements, minimal work has been performed to assess the potential dangers many of these supplements may have on the host’s well-being, in particular the host’s ability to respond to infection. One supplement extensively used by both adolescents and adults is creatine. Using Real-time PCR, we examined the impact of short-term exposure of a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells) to two readily available forms of creatine used in supplements – creatine monohydrate (CR) and creatine ethyl ester (CEE) as well as the end product of creatine metabolism, creatinine (CRN), on expression of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-7. CR down-regulated TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4 and TLR-7 mRNA levels in RAW cells. Similar results were observed following exposure of RAW cells to CRN. Conversely CEE appears to possess immunostimulatory properties and increases expression of TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-7 in RAW cells. These data are supported by immunostaining using antibodies specific for the individual TLRs before and after exposure of RAW cells to CR, CRN, or CEE. To extend these findings, we isolated murine splenocytes and exposed the cells to CR, CEE, or CRN for 24 hours and performed immunofluorescent staining for TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4 and TLR-7. The results obtained from this study with primary splenocytes were consistent with the studies using RAW cells. Together, these data suggest that creatine and creatine derivatives may impact the ability of immune cells to sense a wide array of viral and bacterial pathogens. Of great interest, CRN - largely considered to be a waste product of the argenine biosynthesis pathway may also have immunosuppressive properties similar to those of CR.",

Further in vitro studies showed that betaine supplementation could correct these alterations in the ratio as well as attenuate alcoholic steatosis. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the protective effect of betaine is via its effect on PEMT activity. Male Wistar rats were fed the Lieber DeCarli control or ethanol diet with or without 1% betaine supplementation for 4 weeks. We observed that ethanol feeding resulted in decreased phosphatidylcholine (PC) production by a PEMT-catalyzed reaction. Betaine supplementation corrected the ethanol-induced decrease in hepatic SAM:SAH ratios and by normalizing PC production via the PEMT-mediated pathway, significantly reduced fatty infiltration associated with ethanol consumption. This restoration of hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio by betaine supplementation was associated with increases in the activity, enzyme mass and gene expression of the enzyme, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), that remethylates homocysteine. Betaine, by virtue of promoting an alternate remethylation pathway, restores SAM:SAH ratios that, in turn, correct the defective cellular methylation reaction catalyzed by PEMT resulting in protection against the generation of alcoholic steatosis.",

In the current study, we hypothesized that VE supplementation inhibits CYP2E1 and decreases RA catabolism, thereby preventing ethanol-induced hepatocyte hyperproliferation. For 1 month, four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid ethanol (36% of the total calories) diet as follows: either ethanol alone (Alc group) or ethanol in combination with 0.1 mg/kg body wt of all-trans RA (Alc+RA group), 2 mg/kg body wt of VE (Alc+VE group), or both together (Alc+RA+VE group). Control rats were pair-fed a liquid diet with an isocaloric amount of maltodextrin instead of ethanol. The ethanol-fed groups had three-fold higher hepatic CYP2E1 levels, 50% lower hepatic RA levels, and significantly increased hepatocyte proliferation when compared with the controls. The ethanol-fed rats given VE had more than four-fold higher hepatic VE concentrations than did ethanol-fed rats without VE, but this did not prevent ethanol induction of CYP2E1, lower hepatic retinoid levels, or hepatocellular hyperproliferation. Further, VE supplementation could not prevent RA catabolism in liver microsomal fractions of the ethanol-fed rats in vitro. These results show that VE supplementation can neither inhibit ethanol-induced changes in RA catabolism nor prevent ethanol-induced hepatocyte hyperproliferation in the rat liver.",

The present review describes the etiologies of these 3 vitamin deficiencies in ALD and how they interact with chronic ethanol exposure to alter hepatic methionine metabolism. Subsequent sections focus on molecular mechanisms for the interactions of aberrant methionine metabolism with ethanol in the pathogenesis of ALD, in particular the role of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in regulating the epigenetic expressions of genes relevant to pathways of liver injury. The review will conclude with descriptions of studies on the efficacy of SAM in the treatment of ALD and with discussion of potentially fruitful future avenues of research.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption results in hepatotoxicity, steatosis, hypoxia, increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The impact of these changes on cellular respiration and their interaction in a cellular setting is not well understood. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide (˙NO)-dependent modulation of cellular respiration and the sensitivity to hypoxic stress is increased following chronic alcohol consumption. This is important since ˙NO has been shown to regulate mitochondrial function through its interaction with cytochrome c oxidase, although at higher concentrations, and in combination with reactive oxygen species, can result in mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that hepatocytes isolated from alcohol-fed rats had decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic reserve capacity and were more sensitive to ˙NO-dependent inhibition of respiration under room air and hypoxic conditions. We reasoned that this would result in greater hypoxic stress in vivo, and to test this, wild-type and iNOS−/− mice were administered alcohol-containing diets. Chronic alcohol consumption resulted in liver hypoxia in the wild-type mice and increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in the peri-venular region of the liver lobule. These effects were attenuated in the alcohol-fed iNOS−/− mice suggesting that increased mitochondrial sensitivity to ˙NO and reactive nitrogen species in hepatocytes and iNOS plays a critical role in determining the response to hypoxic stress in vivo. These data support the concept that the combined effects of ˙NO and ethanol contribute to an increased susceptibility to hypoxia and the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption on liver.",

The concentrations of probe drugs in rat plasma were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. In the experiment for ademetionine and control group, there was statistical pharmacokinetics difference for phenacetin, metroprolol, midazolam, omeprazole, tolbutamide and bupropion.

		"abstract": "Retinoids (vitamin A and its metabolites) are essential micronutrients that regulate many cellular processes. Greater than 70% of the body’s retinoid reserves are stored in the liver as retinyl ester (RE). Chronic alcohol consumption induces depletion of hepatic retinoid stores, and the extent of this has been correlated with advancing stages of alcoholic liver disease. The goal of this study was to analyze the mechanisms responsible for depletion of hepatic RE stores by alcohol consumption. A change in the fatty-acyl composition of RE in alcohol-fed mice was observed within two weeks after the start of alcohol consumption. Specifically, alcohol-feeding was associated with a significant decline in hepatic retinyl palmitate levels; however, total RE levels were maintained by a compensatory increase in levels of usually minorRE species, particularly retinyl oleate. Our data suggests that alcohol feeding initially stimulates a futile cycle of RE hydrolysis and synthesis, and that the change in RE acyl composition is associated with a change in the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. The alcohol-induced change in RE acyl composition was specific to the liver, and was not seen in lung or white adipose tissue. This shift in hepatic RE fatty acyl composition is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and may be an early biomarker for events associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Chronic and excessive ethanol intake decreases hepatic retinoic acid (RA) concentrations, which may play a critical role in ethanol-induced hyperproliferation in hepatocytes. The present study was conducted to determine whether RA supplementation in chronic ethanol-fed rats could restore hepatic RA concentrations to normal levels and modulate hepatocyte hyperproliferation. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control, ethanol-fed, ethanol-fed + 50 μg all- trans -RA/kg body wt and ethanol-fed + 100 μg all -trans -RA/kg body wt. Ethanol was given to rats at 6.2% (v/v) in a liquid diet to provide 36% of total caloric intake. Control animals received the same amount of liquid diet with isocaloric maltodextrin in place of ethanol. Results show that the ethanol treatment in rats for a month significantly increased the mean number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive hepatocytes [4.96 ± 1.36% (ethanol-fed) versus 0.29 ± 0.08% (control), P &lt; 0.05]. This increase was associated with the induction of hepatic c-Jun protein (6.5-fold increase) and cyclin D1 protein (3-fold increase) in ethanol-fed animals as compared with controls. Furthermore, activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA-binding activity was significantly higher in hepatic nuclear extracts from ethanol-fed rats than those from controls. In contrast, RA supplementation in ethanol-fed rats raised hepatic RA concentration to normal levels and almost completely abolished the ethanol-enhanced c-Jun, cyclin D and AP-1 DNA-binding activities. Moreover, RA supplementation at both doses markedly suppressed the ethanol-induced PCNA-positive hepatocytes by ~80%. These results demonstrate that the restoration of hepatic RA concentrations by dietary RA supplementation suppresses ethanol-induced hepatocyte proliferation via inhibiting c-Jun overexpression, and suggest that RA may play a role in preventing or reversing certain types of ethanol-induced liver injury.",

		"abstract": "Background\n\nAlcohol-induced reduction in the hepatocellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM):S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio impairs the activities of many SAM-dependent methyltransferases. These impairments ultimately lead to the generation of several hallmark features of alcoholic liver injury including steatosis. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) is an important enzyme that catalyzes the final reaction in the creatine biosynthetic process. The liver is a major site for creatine synthesis which places a substantial methylation burden on this organ as GAMT-mediated reactions consume as much as 40% of all the SAM-derived methyl groups. We hypothesized that dietary creatine supplementation could potentially spare SAM, preserve the hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio, and thereby prevent the development of alcoholic steatosis and other consequences of impaired methylation reactions.\n\n\nMethods\n\nFor these studies, male Wistar rats were pair-fed the Lieber-DeCarli control or ethanol (EtOH) diet with or without 1% creatine supplementation. At the end of 4 to 5 weeks of feeding, relevant biochemical and histological analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\n\nWe observed that creatine supplementation neither prevented alcoholic steatosis nor attenuated the alcohol-induced impairments in proteasome activity. The lower hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio seen in the EtOH-fed rats was also not normalized or SAM levels spared when these rats were fed the creatine-supplemented EtOH diet. However, a >10-fold increased level of creatine was observed in the liver, serum, and hearts of rats fed the creatine-supplemented diets.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, dietary creatine supplementation did not prevent alcoholic liver injury despite its known efficacy in preventing high-fat-diet-induced steatosis. Betaine, a promethylating agent that maintains the hepatocellular SAM:SAH, still remains our best option for treating alcoholic steatosis.",

		"abstract": "Creatine is physiologically provided equally by diet and by endogenous synthesis from arginine and glycine with successive involvements of arginine glycine amidinotransferase [AGAT] and guanidinoacetate methyl transferase [GAMT]. A specific plasma membrane transporter, creatine transporter [CRTR] (SLC6A8), further enables cells to incorporate creatine and through uptake of its precursor, guanidinoacetate, also directly contributes to creatine biosynthesis. Breakthrough in the role of creatine has arisen from studies on creatine deficiency disorders. Primary creatine disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive (mutations affecting GATM [for glycine-amidinotransferase, mitochondrial]) and GAMT genes) or X-linked (SLC6A8 gene) traits. They have highlighted the role of creatine in brain functions altered in patients (global developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral disorders). Creatine modulates GABAergic and glutamatergic cerebral pathways, presynaptic CRTR (SLC6A8) ensuring re-uptake of synaptic creatine. Secondary creatine disorders, addressing other genes, have stressed the extraordinary imbrication of creatine metabolism with many other cellular pathways. This high dependence on multiple pathways supports creatine as a cellular sensor, to cell methylation and energy status. Creatine biosynthesis consumes 40% of methyl groups produced as S-adenosylmethionine, and creatine uptake is controlled by AMP activated protein kinase, a ubiquitous sensor of energy depletion. Today, creatine is considered as a potential sensor of cell methylation and energy status, a neurotransmitter influencing key (GABAergic and glutamatergic) CNS neurotransmission, therapeutic agent with anaplerotic properties (towards creatine kinases [creatine–creatine phosphate cycle] and creatine neurotransmission), energetic and antioxidant compound (benefits in degenerative diseases through protection against energy depletion and oxidant species) with osmolyte behavior (retention of water by muscle). This review encompasses all these aspects by providing an illustrated metabolic account for brain and body creatine in health and disease, an algorithm to diagnose metabolic and gene bases of primary and secondary creatine deficiencies, and a metabolic exploration by 1H-MRS assessment of cerebral creatine levels and response to therapeutic measures.",

One such methyltransferase is guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) that catalyzes the last step of creatine synthesis.

At the end of the feeding regimen, the liver, kidney, and blood were removed from these rats for subsequent biochemical analyses.\n\n\nResults\n\nWe observed ~60% decrease in creatine levels in the livers from EtOH-fed rats as compared to controls. The reduction in creatine levels correlated with lower SAM:SAH ratio observed in the livers of the EtOH-fed rats. Further, in vitro experiments with cell-free system and hepatic cells revealed it is indeed elevated SAH and lower SAM:SAH ratio that directly impairs GAMT activity and significantly reduces creatine synthesis. EtOH intake also slightly decreases the hepatocellular uptake of the creatine precursor, guanidinoacetate (GAA), and the GAMT enzyme expression that could additionally contribute to reduced liver creatine synthesis. The consequences of impaired hepatic creatine synthesis by chronic EtOH consumption include (i) increased toxicity due to GAA accumulation in the liver; (ii) reduced protection due to lower creatine levels in the liver, and (iii) reduced circulating and cardiac creatine levels.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nChronic EtOH consumption affects the hepatic creatine biosynthetic pathway leading to detrimental consequences not only in the liver but could also affect distal organs such as the heart that depend on a steady supply of creatine from the liver.",

		"abstract": "Previous studies showed that chronic ethanol administration alters methionine metabolism in the liver, resulting in increased intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels and increased homocysteine release into the plasma. We showed further that these changes appear to be reversed by betaine administration. This study compared the effects of betaine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), another methylating agent, on ethanol-induced changes of methionine metabolism and hepatic steatosis. Wistar rats were fed ethanol or control Lieber-Decarli liquid diet for 4 wk and metabolites of the methionine cycle were measured in isolated hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from ethanol-fed rats had a 50% lower intracellular SAM:SAH ratio and almost 2-fold greater homocysteine release into the media compared with controls. Supplementation of betaine or SAM in the incubation media increased this ratio in hepatocytes from both control and ethanol-fed rats and attenuated the ethanol-induced increased hepatocellular triglyceride levels by ∼20%. On the other hand, only betaine prevented the increase in generation of homocysteine in the incubation media under basal and methionine-loaded conditions. SAM can correct only the ratio and the methylation defects and may in fact be detrimental after prolonged use because of its propensity to increase homocysteine release. Both SAM and betaine are effective in increasing the SAM:SAH ratio in hepatocytes and in attenuating hepatic steatosis; however, only betaine can effectively methylate homocysteine and prevent increased homocysteine release by the liver.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of age upon hepatic gluconeogenesis (HGN) from lactate in the presence of various concentrations of alcohol from young (3 months) and old (24 months) male rats. After a 24-hour fast, livers were perfused with collagenase and the hepatocytes were isolated. Aliquots of the cell suspension were placed in Krebs–Henseleit buffer and incubated with lactate, [U–14C]lactate, and nine different concentrations of ethanol (EtOH) for 30min. Dose–effect curves were generated for the determination of maximal and half-maximal alcohol-induced inhibition on gluconeogenesis. There were no significant differences in basal HGN (lactate only and no EtOH) between young and old hepatocytes, 86.9±6.3nmol/mg protein/30min. The addition of ethanol significantly reduced HGN from lactate in both groups. At the highest ethanol concentration (15mM), the glucose production was inhibited more from old, 46.1±1.2nmol/mg protein/30min, compared to young hepatocytes, 56.0±1.6nmol/mg protein/30min. The greater age-related reduction in HGN was confirmed by the minimal glycogenolysis, and the concomitant decline in [U–14C]glucose production, lactate uptake, and [U–14C]lactate uptake. The results suggest that alcohol elicits a greater inhibition upon HGN from lactate in old compared to young liver cells.",

In this study, we investigated whether ethanol exposure causes an accumulation of modified proteins bearing atypical isoaspartyl residues that may be related to impaired PIMT activity. We further sought to determine whether betaine administration could prevent the accumulation of these types of damaged proteins.\nMethods\nLivers of male Wistar rats, fed the Lieber DeCarli control, ethanol or 1% betaine-supplemented diets for 4 weeks, were processed for PIMT-related analyses.\nResults\nWe observed a significant increase in the accumulation of modified proteins bearing isoaspartyl residues, i.e. the substrates for PIMT, in homogenate samples and various subcellular fractions of livers from ethanol-fed rats. Betaine supplementation prevented this accumulation of damaged proteins. In contrast, ethanol exposure induced no changes in the PIMT enzyme activity levels as compared to controls. The accumulation of damaged proteins negatively correlated with hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratios.\nConclusions\nEthanol consumption results in the accumulation of modified proteins bearing atypical isoaspartyl residues via impaired in vivo PIMT activity. Betaine administration prevents the ethanol-induced accumulation of isoaspartyl-containing proteins by restoring the PIMT-catalyzed protein repair reaction through normalizing the hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratios.",

		"abstract": "S-adenosylmethionine, formed by the adenylation of methionine via S-adenosylmethionine synthase, is the methyl donor in virtually all known biological methylations. These methylation reactions produce a methylated substrate andS-adenosylhomocysteine, which is subsequently metabolized to homocysteine. The methylation of guanidinoacetate to form creatine consumes more methyl groups than all other methylation reactions combined. Therefore, we examined the effects of increased or decreased methyl demand by these physiological substrates on plasma homocysteine by feeding rats guanidinoacetate- or creatine-supplemented diets for 2 wk. Plasma homocysteine was significantly increased (∼50%) in rats maintained on guanidinoacetate-supplemented diets, whereas rats maintained on creatine-supplemented diets exhibited a significantly lower (∼25%) plasma homocysteine level. Plasma creatine and muscle total creatine were significantly increased in rats fed the creatine-supplemented or guanidinoacetate-supplemented diets. The activity of kidney l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of guanidinoacetate, was significantly decreased in both supplementation groups. To examine the role of the liver in mediating these changes in plasma homocysteine, isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated with methionine in the presence and absence of guanidinoacetate and creatine, and homocysteine export was measured. Homocysteine export was significantly increased in the presence of guanidinoacetate. Creatine, however, was without effect. These results suggest that homocysteine metabolism is sensitive to methylation demand imposed by physiological substrates.",

This defect in homocysteine remethylation was shown to increase plasma homocysteine and to interfere with the production of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in ethanol-fed rats. These changes were shown to be reversed by the administration of betaine, an alternative methylating agent. This study was undertaken to determine additional effects of ethanol on methionine metabolism and their functional consequences. The influences of methionine loading and betaine supplementation were also evaluated. Adult Wistar rats were fed ethanol or a control Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 4 wk, and metabolites of the methionine cycle were measured in vitro in isolated hepatocytes under basal and methionine-supplemented conditions. S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) concentrations were elevated in hepatocytes isolated from ethanol-fed rats compared with controls and in hepatocytes from both groups when supplemented with methionine. The addition of betaine to the methionine-supplemented incubation media reduced the elevated SAH levels. The decrease in the intracellular SAH:SAM ratio due to ethanol consumption inhibited the activity of the liver-specific SAM-dependent methyltransferase, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase. Our data indicate that betaine, by remethylating homocysteine and removing SAH, overcomes the detrimental effects of ethanol consumption on methionine metabolism and may be effective in correcting methylation defects and treating liver diseases.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nAlcohol consumption increases apoptosis of hepatocytes. This effect appears to be mediated by the induction of hepatic cytochrome P-4502E1(CYP2E1) and its generation of free radicals, which results in an enhanced lipid peroxidation that initiates apoptosis. Because polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC), a soybean extract rich in polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines, decreases the induction of ethanol-specific CYP2E1 and opposes oxidative stress, we hypothesized that PPC supplementation may attenuate hepatocyte apoptosis caused by ethanol ingestion.\nMethods:\nTwenty-eight male Sprague Dawley® rats were pair-fed Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing 36% of energy as alcohol or an isocaloric amount of carbohydrate for 28 days. Half of the rats were given PPC (3 g/liter), whereas the other half received the same amount of linoleate (as safflower oil) and of choline as the bitartrate. An additional dose of alcohol (3 g/kg) was given intragastrically 90 min before the livers were removed. We assessed apoptosis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections by using the TUNEL (terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assay. Apoptotic hepatocytes were identified by positive TUNEL staining in conjunction with condensation of nucleoplasm or margination of chromatin. In each rat, 20,000 to 60,000 hepatocytes were counted by light microscopy by using Image-Pro Plus computer software, and the incidence of apoptosis was expressed as the percentage of total hepatocytes.\nResults:\nAlcohol feeding resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in apoptosis of hepatocytes compared to pair-fed control rats; PPC supplementation decreased the alcohol-induced apoptosis to less than half. No difference in the incidence of apoptosis between the control and PPC-supplemented rats was found in the absence of alcohol. Apoptosis was distributed randomly in the liver lobules of the rats fed the control diet, whereas the alcohol-induced apoptosis was significantly increased in the perivenular area. PPC supplementation strikingly reduced this effect.\nConclusions:\nPPC attenuates alcohol-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes; this effect may provide a mechanism for PPC's protection against liver injury, possibly in association with its antioxidative action via the down-regulation of ethanol-mediated CYP2E1 induction.",

		"abstract": "Mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts of molecular oxygen consumption in the electron transport chain. Most cellular oxygen is consumed in the cytochrome-c oxidase complex of the respiratory chain, which does not generate reactive species. The ubiquinone pool of complex III of respiration is the major site within the respiratory chain that generates superoxide anion as a result of a single electron transfer to molecular oxygen. Superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the former by superoxide dismutase, are precursor of hydroxyl radical through the participation of transition metals. Glutathione (GSH) in mitochondria is the only defense available to metabolize hydrogen peroxide. A small fraction of the total cellular GSH pool is sequestered in mitochondria by the action of a carrier that transports GSH from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria are not only one of the main cellular sources of ROS, they also are a key target of ROS. Mitochondria are subcellular targets of cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF); depletion of GSH in this organelle renders the cell more susceptible to oxidative stress originating in mitochondria. Ceramide generated during TNF signaling leads to increased production of ROS in mitochondria. Chronic ethanol-fed hepatocytes are selectively depleted of GSH in mitochondria due to a defective operation of the carrier responsible for transport of GSH from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. Under these conditions, limitation of the mitochondrial GSH pool represents a critical contributory factor that sensitizes alcoholic hepatocytes to the prooxidant effects of cytokines and prooxidants generated by oxidative metabolism of ethanol. S-adenosyl-L-methionine prevents development of the ethanol-induced defect. The mitochondrial GSH carrier has been functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with mRNA from rat liver. This critical carrier displays functional characteristics distinct from other plasma membrane GSH carriers, such as its ATP dependency, inhibitor specificity, and the size class of mRNA that encode the corresponding carrier, suggesting that the mitochondrial carrier of GSH is a gene product distinct from the plasma membrane transporters.",

Markers of oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal and reduced glutathione), antioxidants (vitamin E, ubiquinol-9, and ubiquinol-10), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species were assessed by HPLC and/or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.\nResults:\nAlcohol feeding increased hepatic 4-hydroxynonenal 3-fold and decreased glutathione by 19%, ubiquinol-10 by 53%, and PC species containing arachidonate (palmitoyl- and stearoylarachidonoylphosphatifidylcholines by 24% and 21%, respectively) and total phospholipids by 14%. PPC feeding prevented the rise of 4-hydroxynonenal, restored glutathione, and increased the hepatic content of dilinolcoylphosphatidylcholine and of some other PC carrying polyunsaturated fatty acids. Administration of iron alone increased hepatic iron, doubled 4-hydroxynonenal and glutathione, whereas it decreased vitamin E, ubiquinol-9, total phospholipids, and several polyunsaturated PC. Alcohol given with iron further exacerbated the hepatic oxidative stress, as documented by the increase of 4-hydroxynonenal and the decrease in glutathione and ubiquinols-10. PPC did not prevent this oxidative stress, although it increased hepatic glutathione. Hepatic dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine content was comparable with and without dietary iron.\nConclusions:\nPPC prevents the alcohol-induced oxidative stress but only in the absence of iron overload.",

		"abstract": "Dietary iron overload damages membrane phospholipids and decreases microsomal cytochromes P-450. We wondered whether this might also pertain to cytochrome P-4502El (2E1) and whether polyenyiphosphatidylcholine (PPC), a 94-96% pure mixture of linoleate-rich polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines that protects against alcohol-induced liver injury, also affects 2E1, either in the presence or absence of iron. Accordingly, rats were fed for 8 weeks our standard liquid diet containing ethanol (36% of energy) or isocaloric carbohydrates, with either PPC (3 g/1000 Cal) or equivalent amounts of linoleate (as safflower oil). 2E1 was assessed by Westem blots and by two of its characteristic enzyme activities: the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS), evaluated by the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde (determined by head space GC), and p-nitrophenolhydroxylase (PNP) activity, measured by HPLC with W detection of 4nitrocatechol. With ethanol (36% of energy) replacing carbohydrates, 2E1 content increased 10-fold, with a corresponding increase in PNP and MEOS activities, but when carbonyl iron (5 g/1000 Cal) was added, the induction was significantly reduced. This iron-induced decrease was corrected by PPC. PPC is rich in linoleate, but when the latter was given as triglycerides (safflower oil), there was no effect, whereas hepatic nonheme iron content was the same in both these groups. It also was found that in the absence of iron, the ethanol-mediated induction of 2E1 and its corresponding enzyme activities were significantly less with PPC (p < 0.001) than with safflower oil. In addition, in alcohol-fed animals, PPC decreased the oxidative stress (as determined by F2-isoprostanes), which reflects yet another hepatoprotective effect of PPC.",

The decrease of RA by ethanol treatment has been proposed to be a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)-dependent process. However, the role of the major ethanol-induced CYP, CYP2E1, in the metabolism of RA has not been defined. <b>Methods:</b> In vitro incubations of RA with microsomal fractions of liver tissue containing CYPs from either ethanol-exposed or non–ethanol-exposed rats were carried out using chemical inhibitors and antibodies against various CYPs. In vivo, both ethanol-exposed and non–ethanol-exposed rats were treated with or without chlormethiazole, a specific CYP2E1 inhibitor, for 1 month. RA and its catabolic metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis. <b>Results:</b> Incubation of RA with the liver microsomal fraction from ethanol-exposed rats resulted in greater disappearance of RA and increased appearance of 18-hydroxy-RA and 4-oxo-RA compared with control rat liver microsomal fractions. The enhancement of RA catabolism by ethanol was inhibited by both CYP2E1 antibody and specific inhibitors (allyl sulfide and chlormethiazole) in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the metabolism of RA into polar metabolites was abolished completely by nonspecific CYP inhibitors (disulfiram and liarozole). Furthermore, treatment with chlormethiazole in ethanol-fed rats in vivo restored both hepatic and plasma RA concentrations to normal levels. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ethanol-induced CYP2E1 plays a major role in the degradation of RA, which may provide a possible biochemical mechanism for chronic and excessive ethanol intake as a risk for both hepatic and extrahepatic cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.</p><p>GASTROENTEROLOGY 2001;120:179-189</p>",

		"abstract": "Chronic ethanol intake may interfere with retinoid signal transduction by inhibiting retinoic acid synthesis and by enhancing activator protein-1 (AP-1) (c-Jun and c-Fos) expression, thereby contributing to malignant transformation. To determine the effect of ethanol on hepatic retinoid levels, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) gene expression, chronic ethanol (36% of total calorie intake) pair-feeding was conducted on rats for a 1-month period. Retinoic acid, retinol, and retinyl ester concentrations in both liver and plasma were examined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both retinoic acid receptor (α, β, γ) and AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) expression in the rat liver were examined by using Western blot analysis. Treatment with high-dose ethanol led to a significant reduction of retinoic acid concentration in both the liver and the plasma (11- and 8.5-fold reduction, respectively), as compared with animals pair-fed an isocaloric control diet containing the same amount of vitamin A. Similar to the retinoic acid reductions, both retinol and retinyl palmitate levels in the livers of the alcohol-fed group decreased significantly, but in smaller fold reduction (6.5- and 2.6-fold reduction, respectively). Ethanol did not modulate the expression of RARα, -β, and -γ genes in the liver. However, chronic alcohol feeding enhanced AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) expression by 7- to 8-fold, as compared with the control group. These data suggest that functional down-regulation of RARs by inhibiting biosynthesis of retinoic acid and up-regulation of AP-1 gene expression may be important mechanisms for causing malignant transformation by ethanol.",

		"abstract": "Background Chronic ethanol intake results in decreased hepatic vitamin A levels through both enhanced degradation of vitamin A via a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)-dependent process and increased mobilization of vitamin A from the liver into the circulation. This study investigated whether treatment with chlormethiazole, a CYP inhibitor, restores vitamin A in the livers of ethanol-fed rats. Methods Ethanol-exposed and non-ethanol-exposed rats were treated with or without chlormethiazole (10 and 100 mg/kg body weight) for 1 month. Liver and plasma levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Expressions of hepatic lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and cellular retinol-binding protein were analyzed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic retinol esterification by LRAT was examined by using incubations of the microsomal fractions of livers with exogenous sources of retinol. Results Ethanol-feeding in rats for a month resulted in lower hepatic levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate than those found in controls and the occurrence of several polar retinoid metabolites. In contrast, treatment with chlormethiazole at two different doses in ethanol-fed rats completely blocked the formation of hepatic retinoid polar metabolites and restored hepatic levels of retinol and hepatic retinyl palmitate in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, increased plasma concentrations of retinyl palmitate in rats fed with ethanol, which indicate increased mobilization of vitamin A, were partially inhibited by chlormethiazole treatment. However, neither ethanol nor chlormethiazole treatment altered the expression and activity of LRAT in the liver of rats. Hepatic expression of cellular retinol-binding protein increased significantly in ethanol-fed rats with or without chlormethiazole treatment compared with control rats. Conclusions These data suggest that chlormethiazole can restore both hepatic retinol and retinyl ester concentrations to normal levels in ethanol-fed rats through blocking enhanced both degradation of vitamin A and mobilization of vitamin A from the liver into the circulation.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of nanogold flakes against alcoholic liver disease. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups: C (control liquid diet), CLF (control liquid diet with gold flakes at 1.03 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day), CHF (control liquid diet with gold flakes at 5.15 mg/kg BW/day), E (ethanol liquid diet), ELF (ethanol liquid diet with gold flakes at 1.03 mg/kg BW/day), and EHF (ethanol liquid diet with gold flakes at 5.15 mg/kg BW/day). The liquid diets were prepared daily. Gold flakes were added to the ethanol 1 h before preparing the ethanol liquid diets, as an aging process. After 10 weeks, rats in group E showed significantly higher plasma aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities than those in group C. A significantly increased concentration of hepatic triglyceride (TG) was found in group E. Furthermore, higher hepatic glutathione reductase (GRD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities together with higher tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α concentration and higher hepatic cytochrome (CYP2E1) protein expression were also observed in group E. In contrast, the hepatic TG concentration in group EHF was significantly lower than that of group E. In addition, hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GPX), SOD, and CAT activities together with TNF-α concentration and hepatic CYP2E1 protein expression in group EHF were significantly lower than those in group E. We concluded that nanogold flakes might ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injury by maintaining the hepatic antioxidative status. In addition, nanogold flakes may reduce fat accumulation caused by chronic ethanol feeding via decreasing hepatic TNF-α.",

		"abstract": "Synthesized in the cytosol of cells, a fraction of cytosolic glutathione (GSH) is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix where it reaches a high concentration and plays a critical role in defending mitochondria against oxidants and electrophiles. Evidence mainly from kidney and liver mitochondria indicated that the dicarboxylate and the 2-oxoglutarate carriers contribute to the transport of GSH across the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, differential features between kidney and liver mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) transport seem to suggest the existence of additional carriers the identity of which remains to be established. One of the characteristic features of the hepatic mitochondrial transport of GSH is its regulation by membrane fluidity. Conditions leading to increased cholesterol deposition in the mitochondrial inner membrane such as in alcohol-induced liver injury decrease membrane fluidity and impair the mitochondrial transport of GSH. Depletion of mitochondrial GSH by alcohol is believed to contribute to the sensitization of the liver to alcohol-induced injury through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated hepatocellular death. Through control of mitochondrial electron transport chain-generated oxidants, mitochondrial GSH modulates cell death and hence its regulation may be a key target to influence disease progression and drug-induced cell death.",

		"abstract": "Activated monocytes and macrophages have been postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Monocyte activation can be documented by measurement of neopterin, adhesion cell molecules, and certain proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We first became interested in the role of monocytes and monocyte-derived cytokines in ALD in relation to altered zinc metabolism that occurs regularly in ALD. Patients with ALD have hypozincemia, which responds poorly to oral zinc supplementation. We have shown that in ALD monocytes make a low-molecular-weight substance that, when injected into rabbits, causes prominent hypozincemia. Subsequently, multiple cytokines [especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-8] have been shown to be overproduced by monocytes in ALD. We initially showed that monocytes in ALD spontaneously produce TNF and overproduce TNF in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulus, and this could be attenuated by antioxidants in vitro and in vivo. Alterations in the endotoxin-binding protein LPS-binding protein, in CD14, and in the endotoxin receptor Toll-like receptor 4 all may play roles in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine signaling in ALD. Moreover, several groups have documented increased TNF receptor density in monocytes in ALD. Inadequate negative regulation of TNF occurs at multiple levels in ALD. This includes decreased monocyte production of the important antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and blunted response to the antiinflammatory properties of adenosine. Finally, generation of reactive oxygen species (which occurs during alcohol metabolism) and products of lipid peroxidation induce production of cytokines, such as TNF and IL-8. In conclusion, there are multiple overlapping potential mechanisms for enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes in ALD. We postulate that activation of monocytes and macrophages with subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production plays an important role in certain metabolic complications of ALD and is a component of the liver injury of ALD.",

		"abstract": "Hepatic deficiency of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a critical acquired metabolic abnormality in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in many experimental models of hepatotoxicity. Subnormal AdoMet, elevated serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and endotoxemia (LPS) are hallmarks of ALD and experimental liver injury. AdoMet deficiency is attributed to its subnormal synthesis, but mechanisms for increased TNF are not known. AdoMet deficiency may affect the critical balance of proinflammatory (e.g., TNF) and antiinflammatory [e.g., interleukin (IL)-10] cytokines. Rats maintained on a choline-deficient diet with limited amounts of methionine (MCD diet) developed AdoMet deficiency. When challenged with LPS, rats fed MCD diet had significantly increased serum TNF levels and worse liver injury compared with findings for controls. Exogenous AdoMet attenuated liver injury and serum TNF levels. Results of in vitro studies with the use of RAW 264.7 cells demonstrated that exogenous AdoMet supplementation lowered LPS-induced TNF formation in a dose-dependent manner, and AdoMet deficiency enhanced TNF secretion and TNF gene expression. AdoMet also dose-dependently decreased LPS-stimulated TNF production from monocytes obtained from patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Finally, AdoMet supplementation stimulated production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. Interleukin-10 plays a critical role in the modulation of TNF production, and IL-10 may inhibit hepatic fibrosis. This article will review (1) the role of AdoMet in ALD/liver injury, (2) the role of TNF/proinflammatory cytokines in ALD, (3) potential roles of AdoMet in TNF/proinflammatory cytokine regulation in ALD, and (4) conclusions and future directions.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol-induced hypoglycemia has traditionally been attributed to the amount of ethanol consumed rather than any inherent decline in glucose output capacity by the gluconeogenic organs and/or an increase in skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Further, while the potential for sex differences that might impact glucose homeostasis following chronic alcohol consumption has been recognized, direct evidence has been noticeably absent. This paper will provide a brief review of past and present reports of the potential for sex differences in glucose homeostasis following chronic ethanol consumption. This paper will also provide direct evidence from our laboratory demonstrating sex differences from chronic alcohol consumption resulting in a decrement in glucose appearance and more importantly, a specific decline in hepatic gluconeogenic (HGN) capacity in the absence and presence of ethanol. All our studies involved 8 weeks of chronic alcohol consumption in male and female Wistar rats, as well as a 24 to 48 hour fast to deplete hepatic glycogen stores. Under the conditions of chronic alcohol consumption and an acute dose of ethanol, we provide in vivo evidence of an early decline in whole body glucose appearance in females fed an ethanol diet compared to controls. While the decline was also observed in males fed the alcohol diet, it occurred much later compared to ethanol fed females. The site for the decline in whole body glucose production (i.e., either the kidneys or the liver) was beyond the scope of our prior in vivo study. In a follow-up study using the in situ perfused liver preparation, we provide additional evidence for a specific reduction in HGN capacity from lactate in ethanol fed females compared to ethanol fed males in the absence of alcohol in the perfusion medium. Finally, employing the isolated hepatocyte technique, we report decrements in HGN from lactate in ethanol fed females compared to ethanol fed males in the presence of ethanol in the incubation medium. The mechanism for the specific decline in HGN within the liver of ethanol fed females remains to be determined. To the extent that our observations in animals can be extrapolated to humans, we conclude that alcoholic women are more susceptible to ethanol-induced hypoglycemia compared to alcoholic men.",

		"abstract": "The objective of this review is to explore the relationship between alcohol and the metabolism of the essential micronutrient, vitamin A; as well as the impact this interaction has on alcohol-induced disease in adults. Depleted hepatic vitamin A content has been reported in human alcoholics, an observation that has been confirmed in animal models of chronic alcohol consumption. Indeed, alcohol consumption has been associated with declines in hepatic levels of retinol (vitamin A), as well as retinyl ester and retinoic acid; collectively referred to as retinoids. Through the use of animal models, the complex interplay between alcohol metabolism and vitamin A homeostasis has been studied; the reviewed research supports the notion that chronic alcohol consumption precipitates a decline in hepatic retinoid levels through increased breakdown, as well as increased export to extra-hepatic tissues. While the precise biochemical mechanisms governing alcohol’s effect remain to be elucidated, its profound effect on hepatic retinoid status is irrefutable. In addition to a review of the literature related to studies on tissue retinoid levels and the metabolic interactions between alcohol and retinoids, the significance of altered hepatic retinoid metabolism in the context of alcoholic liver disease is also considered.",

		"abstract": "The impact of alcohol-induced suppression on hepatic gluconeogenesis (HGN) after chronic ethanol consumption between males and females is unknown. To determine the effects of chronic alcohol consumption (8 weeks) on HGN, the isolated hepatocyte technique was employed on 24 hr fasted male and female Wistar rats. Livers were initially perfused with collagenase and the hepatocytes were isolated. Aliquots of the cell suspension were placed in Krebs-Henseleit buffer and incubated for 30 minutes with lactate, [U-14C]lactate, and nine different concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). Dose-effect curves were generated for the determination of maximal and half-maximal alcohol-induced inhibition on HGN. There was no significant difference in HGN (lactate only and no EtOH) between males and females fed the control diet (88.5 ± 5.1 nmol/mg protein/30 min). Similarly, the HGN (lactate only and no EtOH) in males fed the ethanol diet (ME) were not significantly different (82.8 ± 3.5 nmol/mg protein/30 min) compared to controls. In contrast, the females chronically fed the ethanol diet (FE) had significantly (P < 0.05) lower HGN (67.8 ± 4.6 nmol/mg protein/30 min) compared to both ME and controls. With alcohol in the incubation medium the HGN significantly (P < 0.05) declined in all groups. While alcohol suppressed HGN to a larger (P < 0.05) extent in ME (45.8 ± 3.7 nmol/mg protein/ 30 min) compared to controls (64.0 ± 3.8 nmol/mg protein/30 min), the inhibition was even greater (P < 0.05) in FE (32.7 ± 3.2 nmol/mg protein/30 min). The more pronounced effect of chronic alcohol consumption on HGN in the presence of ethanol in female hepatocytes was supported by the concomitant decreases (P < 0.05) in 14C-lactate incorporation into 14C-glucose, lactate uptake, and 14C-lactate uptake. The results suggest that chronic alcohol consumption elicits a greater reduction on HGN in the presence of ethanol in the hepatocytes of females compared to males.",

		"abstract": "AIM\nTo investigate the hypothesis that exposure to guanidinoacetate (GAA, a potent methyl-group consumer) either alone or combined with ethanol intake for a prolonged period of time would cause more advanced liver pathology thus identifying methylation defects as the initiator and stimulator for progressive liver damage.\n\nMETHODS\nAdult male Wistar rats were fed the control or ethanol Lieber DeCarli diet in the absence or presence of GAA supplementation. At the end of 6 wk of the feeding regimen, various biochemical and histological analyses were conducted.\n\nRESULTS\nContrary to our expectations, we observed that GAA treatment alone resulted in a histologically normal liver without evidence of hepatosteatosis despite persistence of some abnormal biochemical parameters. This protection could result from the generation of creatine from the ingested GAA. Ethanol treatment for 6 wk exhibited changes in liver methionine metabolism and persistence of histological and biochemical defects as reported before. Further, when the rats were fed the GAA-supplemented ethanol diet, similar histological and biochemical changes as observed after 2 wk of combined treatment, including inflammation, macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis and a marked decrease in the methylation index were noted. In addition, rats on the combined treatment exhibited increased liver toxicity and even early fibrotic changes in a subset of animals in this group. The worsening liver pathology could be related to the profound reduction in the hepatic methylation index, an increased accumulation of GAA and the inability of creatine generated to exert its hepato-protective effects in the setting of ethanol.\n\nCONCLUSION\nTo conclude, prolonged exposure to a methyl consumer superimposed on chronic ethanol consumption causes persistent and pronounced liver damage.",

		"abstract": "In spite of the extensive work on the effect of temperature on plants in general, there are very few reviews on this subject as a whole, the most extensive being that of Belehradek (7). The ecological effects of temperature are discussed by Daubenmire (35), Whyte (153), and Walter (139). Tem­ perature, along with light, humidity, etc., belongs to the important factors in the environment of plants. It is also an insufficiently appreciated tool for research, for in many cases the processes of growth can be differentiated by their temperature responses. A good example of this fact is the photo­ synthetic process, in which temperature affects a chemical process at high light intensities and a diffusion process at low light intensities when the photochemical process becomes limiting. The temperatures at which most physiological processes go on normally in plants range from approximately O°C. to 40°C. Very high and very low temperatures cause injury effects, which are a different matter, have already been discussed in previous volumes (64, 75), and need no further elaboration (see also 81). We can distinguish between direct temperature effects on physiological partial processes, which allow us to draw conclusions about the physico-chemical processes involved, and the different effects of temperature on the organism as a whole. There are direct and delayed effects, and effects of fluctuation in temperature. For practical purposes we can subdivide the subject still further to effects of temperature on a) the early stages of growth (germination, vernalization), b) during the plant's maturity, and c) on the dormant stages. Almost half of all published papers in plant physiology could be quoted in this review, for all contain references to temperature, if only to describe experimental conditions. Actually, only the few in which temperature response is treated as a major problem will be discussed; this should give a bird's-eye view of the whole. The effects of temperature on the individual life and growth processes must be known in order to understand the effect of temperature on plants as a whole. Cell growth, especially cell elongation, has a high Q10 which indicates that this is a chemically rather than physically controlled phe­ nomenon (26). The growth of excised plant parts has been studied at different temperatures. The optimal growth temperature for tomato roots was found to be 30°C. (150); for cotton roots, it was 25°; for corn and 1 The survey of literature pertaining to this review was concluded in November,",

		"abstract": "Latent heat storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy. Unlike the sensible heat storage method, the latent heat storage method provides much higher storage density, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. This paper reviews previous work on latent heat storage and provides an insight to recent efforts to develop new classes of phase change materials (PCMs) for use in energy storage. Three aspects have been the focus of this review: PCM materials, encapsulation and applications. There are large numbers of phase change materials that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. Paraffin waxes are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require large surface area. Hydrated salts have larger energy storage density and higher thermal conductivity but experience supercooling and phase segregation, and hence, their application requires the use of some nucleating and thickening agents. The main advantages of PCM encapsulation are providing large heat transfer area, reduction of the PCMs reactivity towards the outside environment and controlling the changes in volume of the storage materials as phase change occurs. The different applications in which the phase change method of heat storage can be applied are also reviewed in this paper. The problems associated with the application of PCMs with regards to the material and the methods used to contain them are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

They have also been used, off label, as cognitive enhancers in populations of patients with mental disorders, including substance abusers that demonstrate impaired cognitive function. A debated non-medical use of MOD in healthy individuals to improve intellectual performance is raising questions about its potential abuse liability in this population.\n\nResults and Conclusions\nMOD has low micromolar affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT). Inhibition of dopamine (DA) reuptake via the DAT explains the enhancement of DA levels in several brain areas, an effect shared with psychostimulants like cocaine, methylphenidate and the amphetamines. However, its neurochemical effects and anatomical pattern of brain area activation differ from typical psychostimulants and are consistent with its beneficial effects on cognitive performance processes such as attention, learning, and memory. At variance with typical psychostimulants, MOD shows very low, if any, abuse liability, in spite of its use as a cognitive enhancer by otherwise healthy individuals. Finally, recent clinical studies have focused on the potential use of MOD as a medication for treatment of drug abuse, but have not shown consistent outcomes. However, positive trends in several result measures suggest that medications that improve cognitive function, like MOD or R-MOD, may be beneficial for treatment of substance use disorders in certain patient populations.",

		"abstract": "Abstract Exposure to an uncontrollable stressor elicits a constellation of physiological and behavioral sequel in laboratory rats that often reflect aspects of anxiety and other emotional disruptions. We review evidence suggesting that plasticity within the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is critical to the expression of uncontrollable stressor-induced anxiety. Specifically, after uncontrollable stressor exposure subsequent anxiogenic stimuli evoke greater 5-HT release in DRN terminal regions including the amygdala and striatum; and pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors in these regions prevents expression of stressor-induced anxiety. Importantly, the controllability of stress, the presence of safety signals, and a history of exercise mitigate the expression of stressor-induced anxiety. These stress-protective factors appear to involve distinct neural substrates; with stressor controllability requiring the medial prefrontal cortex, safety signals the insular cortex and exercise affecting the 5-HT system directly. Knowledge of the distinct yet converging mechanisms underlying these stress-protective factors could provide insight into novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",

		"abstract": "The possibility to combine two physico-chemical phenomena is studiedin this work in order to attain simultaneous control of temperature and light intensity in a greenhouse: (a) isothermal heat storage in phase change materials and (b) thermochromic behavior of complex compounds dissolved in the phase change materials. Two binary mixtures melting near the ambient temperature were studied: (a) 0.925 Ca(NO3)2 - 4.06 H2O + 0.075 CaCl2 - 6.11 H2O melting at 35.6 deg.C and (b) 0.9 CH v3CONH2 + 0.1 Ca(NO3)2 - 4 H2O, melting at 27.7 deg.C. The melting temperature, the enthalpy offusion and the heat capacity of both mixtures were determined from DSC measurements. Both mixtures showed to be suitable solvents for theformation of consecutive cobalt(II) chloride complexes. The compositions of the complex compounds were adjusted in each mixture so that the absorption spectra in visible spectral range exhibited low absorbance at the melting temperature and a pronounced increase of the absorbance and/or change of color with the increase of temperature in the range relevant for passive solar energy receivers. The combined latent heat storage and the outstanding reversible change of the optical properties of the dissolved complex compounds with temperature is proposed to be applied in solar heated agricultural greenhouses in areas with fluctuating climate conditions. The increase of absorbance with.temperature acts as an auto-regulated shading protection from overheating. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR",

		"abstract": "Conditioned fear plays a key role in anxiety disorders as well as depression and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Understanding how neuromodulators drive the associated learning and memory processes, including memory consolidation, retrieval/expression, and extinction (recall), is essential in the understanding of (individual differences in vulnerability to) these disorders and their treatment. The human and rodent studies I review here together reveal, amongst others, that acute selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment facilitates fear conditioning, reduces contextual fear, and increases cued fear, chronic SSRI treatment reduces both contextual and cued fear, 5-HT1A receptors inhibit the acquisition and expression of contextual fear, 5-HT2A receptors facilitates the consolidation of cued and contextual fear, inactivation of 5-HT2C receptors facilitate the retrieval of cued fear memory, the 5-HT3 receptor mediates contextual fear, genetically induced increases in serotonin levels are associated with increased fear conditioning, impaired cued fear extinction, or impaired extinction recall, and that genetically induced 5-HT depletion increases fear conditioning and contextual fear. Several explanations are presented to reconcile seemingly paradoxical relationships between serotonin levels and conditioned fear.",

		"abstract": "Endurance sports are increasing in popularity and athletes at all levels are looking for ways to optimize their performance by training and nutrition. For endurance exercise lasting 30 min or more, the most likely contributors to fatigue are dehydration and carbohydrate depletion, whereas gastrointestinal problems, hyperthermia, and hyponatraemia can reduce endurance exercise performance and are potentially health threatening, especially in longer events (\\textgreater4 h). Although high muscle glycogen concentrations at the start may be beneficial for endurance exercise, this does not necessarily have to be achieved by the traditional supercompensation protocol. An individualized nutritional strategy can be developed that aims to deliver carbohydrate to the working muscle at a rate that is dependent on the absolute exercise intensity as well as the duration of the event. Endurance athletes should attempt to minimize dehydration and limit body mass losses through sweating to 2-3% of body mass. Gastrointestinal problems occur frequently, especially in long-distance races. Problems seem to be highly individual and perhaps genetically determined but may also be related to the intake of highly concentrated carbohydrate solutions, hyperosmotic drinks, as well as the intake of fibre, fat, and protein. Hyponatraemia has occasionally been reported, especially among slower competitors with very high intakes of water or other low sodium drinks. Here I provide a comprehensive overview of recent research findings and suggest several new guidelines for the endurance athlete on the basis of this. These guidelines are more detailed and allow a more individualized approach.",

		"abstract": "Computational models of learning typically train on labeled input patterns (supervised learning), unlabeled input patterns (unsupervised learning), or a combination of the two (semi-supervised learning). In each case input patterns have a fixed number of features throughout training and testing. Human and machine learning contexts present additional opportunities for expanding incomplete knowledge from formal training, via self-directed learning that incorporates features not previously experienced. This article defines a new self-supervised learning paradigm to address these richer learning contexts, introducing a neural network called self-supervised ARTMAP. Self-supervised learning integrates knowledge from a teacher (labeled patterns with some features), knowledge from the environment (unlabeled patterns with more features), and knowledge from internal model activation (self-labeled patterns). Self-supervised ARTMAP learns about novel features from unlabeled patterns without destroying partial knowledge previously acquired from labeled patterns. A category selection function bases system predictions on known features, and distributed network activation scales unlabeled learning to prediction confidence. Slow distributed learning on unlabeled patterns focuses on novel features and confident predictions, defining classification boundaries that were ambiguous in the labeled patterns. Self-supervised ARTMAP improves test accuracy on illustrative low-dimensional problems and on high-dimensional benchmarks.

		"abstract": "Objective Heat-related illness is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite no proven efficacy, application of chemical cold packs (CCP) to the skin overlying the large vessels of the neck, groin, and axillae is a traditional recommended cooling modality. The study objective was to compare the cooling rates of CCP applied to these traditional areas vs the glabrous skin surfaces of the cheeks, palms, and soles in exercise-induced hyperthermia. Methods Ten healthy adult male volunteers walked on a treadmill in a heated room (40 ± 0.5 C) while wearing insulated military overgarments until their esophageal temperatures (T\\textlessinf\\textgreateres\\textless/inf\\textgreater) reached 39.2 C. Each participant had three heat stress trials on separate days: no treatment followed by randomly ordered traditional (neck, groin, and axillae) cooling and glabrous skin cooling. Results With no treatment, T\\textlessinf\\textgreateres\\textless/inf\\textgreater remained stable after the first 5 minutes of the heat trial (ΔT\\textlessinf\\textgreateres\\textless/inf\\textgreater = 0.12 ± 0.07 C/10 min). Traditional cooling followed a linear decline (ΔT\\textlessinf\\textgreateres\\textless/inf\\textgreater = 0.17 ± 0.04 C/10 min; P \\textless.001). Glabrous cooling enhanced the treatment effect by a steeper decline (ΔT\\textlessinf\\textgreateres\\textless/inf\\textgreater = 0.30 ± 0.06 C/10 min; P \\textless.001), significantly different from traditional cooling by 2-way analysis of variance (P \\textless.001). Conclusions Application of CCP to glabrous skin surfaces was more effective for treating exercise-induced heat stress than the traditional CCP cooling intervention. This novel cooling technique may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for heat-related illness in the prehospital environment.",

		"abstract": "Stressful experiences during early-life can modulate the genetic programming of specific brain circuits underlying emotional and cognitive aspects of behavioral adaptation to stressful experiences later in life. Although this programming effect exerted by experience-related factors is an important determinant of mental health, its outcome depends on cognitive inputs and hence the valence an individual assigns to a given environmental context. From this perspective we will highlight, with studies in rodents, non-human primates and humans, the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience to stress-related mental disorders, which is based on gene-environment interactions during critical phases of perinatal and juvenile brain development. The three-hit (i.e., hit-1: genetic predisposition, hit-2: early-life environment, and hit-3: later-life environment) concept accommodates the cumulative stress hypothesis stating that in a given context vulnerability is enhanced when failure to cope with adversity accumulates. Alternatively, the concept also points to the individual's predictive adaptive capacity, which underlies the stress inoculation and match/mismatch hypotheses. The latter hypotheses propose that the experience of relatively mild early-life adversity prepares for the future and promotes resilience to similar challenges in later-life; when a mismatch occurs between early and later-life experience, coping is compromised and vulnerability is enhanced. The three-hit concept is fundamental for understanding how individuals can either be prepared for coping with life to come and remain resilient or are unable to do so and succumb to a stress-related mental disorder, under seemingly identical circumstances. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes a new procedure for obtaining hesperidin from the waste orange peel of the citrus industry. It is based on the adsorption of dilute extracts of hesperidin on a styrene-divinylbenzene (SDVB) resin and the desorption in much more reduced volumes by means of alkaline eluents. Hesperidin immediately precipitates with good yield and high purity after acidification of the concentrated solutions, thus overcoming disadvantages due to the high dilution. Different experiments were carried out to examine operating conditions in each phase of the process. Hesperidin was extracted from peel with an aqueous saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution, allowing precipitation of calcium pectates from colloidal pectins that can interfere in the subsequent phases of adsorption and separation of hesperidin. The clear extracts were neutralized to optimize adsorption on resin. The most effective eluent was 0.5 N NaOH solution containing 10% ethanol. Recycling of the crystallization liquor improved the yield and purity of the product and reduced the acid amount required for neutralizing fresh alkaline extracts. Resin must be washed after each adsorption-desorption cycle and regenerated after five cycles. Results can constitute a useful starting point for an industrial application. A flow scheme of the process is also reported.",

The storage unit is a component of ten pieced solar air collectors heating system being developed for space heating of a greenhouse and charging of PCM. CaCl26H2O was used as PCM in thermal energy storage with a melting temperature of 29 ??C. Hot air delivered by ten pieced solar air collector is passed through the PCM to charge the storage unit. The stored heat is utilized to heat ambient air before being admitted to a greenhouse. This study is based on experimental results of the PCM employed to analyze the transient thermal behavior of the storage unit during the charge and discharge periods. The proposed size of collectors integrated PCM provided about 18-23% of total daily thermal energy requirements of the greenhouse for 3-4 h, in comparison with the conventional heating device. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there are a considerable number of studies showing beneficial effects of pre-cooling, definite conclusions on the effectiveness of pre-cooling on performance cannot yet be drawn. Moreover, detailed analyses of the specific conditions under which pre-cooling may be most promising are, so far, missing. Therefore, we conducted a literature search and located 27 peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, which addressed the effects of pre-cooling on performance. These studies were analysed with regard to performance effects and several test circumstances (environmental temperature, test protocol, cooling method, aerobic capacity of the subjects).Eighteen studies were performed in a hot (\\textgreater26°C) environment and eight in a moderate. The cooling protocols were water application (n=12), cooling packs (n=3), cold drinks (n=2), cooling vest (n=6) and a cooled room (n=4). The following different performance tests were used: short-term, high-intensity sprints (n=2), intermittent sprints (n=6), time trials (n= 10), open-end tests (n=7) and graded exercise tests (n=2). If possible, subjects were grouped into different aerobic capacity levels according to their maximal oxygen consumption ( V? O2max): medium 55-65mL/kg/min (n= 11) and high \\textgreater65 mL/kg/min (n=6). For all studies the relative changes of performance due to pre-cooling compared with a control condition, as well as effect sizes (Hedges'g) were calculated. Mean values were weighted according to the number of subjects in each study.Pre-cooling had a larger effect on performance in hot (+6.6%, g=0.62) than in moderate temperatures (+1.4%, g = 0.004). The largest performance enhancements were found for endurance tests like open-end tests (+8.6%, g=0.52), graded exercise tests (+6.0%, g=0.44) and time trials (+4.2%, g=0.44). A similar effect was observed for intermittent sprints (+3.3%, g = 0.43), whereas performance changes were smaller during short-term, high-intensity sprints (-0.5%, g = 0.03). The most promising cooling methods were cold drinks (+15.0%, g= 1.68), cooling packs (+5.6%, g = 0.70) and a cooled room (+10.7%, g = 0.49), whereas a cooling vest (+4.8%, g = 0.31) and water application (+1.2%, g = 0.21) showed only small effects. With respect to aerobic capacity, the best results were found in the subjects with the highest V? O2max (high +7.7%, g = 0.65; medium +3.8%, g = 0.27). There were four studies analysing endurance-trained athletes under time-trial conditions, which, in a practical sense, seem to be most relevant. Those studies found an average effect on performance of 3.7% (g = 0.48).In summary, pre-cooling can effectively enhance endurance performance, particularly in hot environments, whereas sprint exercise is barely affected. In particular, well trained athletes may benefit in a typical competition setting with practical and relevant effects. With respect to feasibility, cold drinks, cooling packs and cooling vests can be regarded as best-practice methods.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, terrorist organizations (e.g., ISIS or al-Qaeda) are increasingly directing terrorists to launch coordinated at-tacks in their home countries. One example is the Paris shoot-ings on January 7, 2015. By monitoring potential terrorists, security agencies are able to detect and stop terrorist plots at their planning stage. Although security agencies may have knowledge about potential terrorists (e.g., who they are, how they interact), they usually have limited resources and can-not monitor all terrorists. Moreover, a terrorist planner may strategically choose to arouse terrorists considering the se-curity agency's monitoring strategy. This paper makes five key contributions toward the challenging problem of com-puting optimal monitoring strategies: 1) A new Stackelberg game model for terrorist plot detection; 2) A modified double oracle framework for computing the optimal strategy effec-tively; 3) Complexity results for both defender and attacker oracle problems; 4) Novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for best response problems of both play-ers; and 5) Effective approximation algorithms for generating suboptimal responses for both players. Experimental evalua-tion shows that our approach can obtain a robust enough so-lution outperforming widely-used centrality based heuristics significantly and scale up to realistic-sized problems.",

		"issue": "6",
		"abstract": "Some have claimed that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates decision making. Others suggest mPFC is selectively involved in the retrieval of remote long-term memory. Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.",

		"issue": "1-3",
		"abstract": "Many translucent industrial insulation applications require optimization of both the thermal and optical properties. Currently, the thermal performance witnessed in today's products often limits the amount of available area which can be designated for translucent panels. For example, translucent wall panels for passive lighting systems must provide both adequate light transmission as well as sufficient thermal insulation. In granular fill systems, these demands can sometimes work against each other since thermal performance will improve as the panel thickness is increased but light transmission will decrease accordingly. In contrast, the optical properties can be significantly enhanced by careful control of the particle size and size distribution. This in turn impacts the thermal resistance since spaces between the particles act as large pores that dominate the heat transfer. We have investigated aerogel materials derived from commercially viable silica sources. Results indicate that depending on the silica precursor, particle size distribution, and control over other processing conditions, the optical transparency can be varied from 25% to 80% in a 20 mm layer. Within these same constraints, we have found the thermal conductivity can be varied from 0.0140 to 0.0210 W/m K. This ability to tailor the optical and thermal characteristics, coupled with superior thermal properties of aerogel, may enable more widespread acceptance. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

		"abstract": "We propose a general hypothesis that integrates affective and cognitive processing with neuroanatomy to explain anxiety pronenes. The premise is that individuals who are prone to anxiety show an altered interoceptive prediction signal, i.e., manifest augmented detection of the difference between the observed and expected body state. As a consequence, the increased prediction signal of a prospective aversive body state triggers an increase in anxious affect, worrisome thoughts and other avoidance behaviors. The anterior insula is proposed to play a key role in this process. Further testing of this model-which should include investigation of genetic and environmental influences-may lead to the development of novel treatments that attenuate this altered interoceptive prediction signal in patients with anxiety disorders. ?? 2006 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",

		"abstract": "Given rapid depletion of conventional energy sources and environmental degradation caused by their over exploitation, the renewable energy sources are believed to be the future. Technologies utilizing renewable energy sources differ significantly from one another, not only with regard to technical and economic aspects but also in relation to their reliability, maturity, and operational experience in utility scale conditions. Technologies used to harness solar energy have emerged as the most promising and mature since solar energy is abundant, freely available, and it has commercial potential too. This paper presents a review of advancements made in the field of solar thermal technology with a focus on techniques employed for its performance enhancement. It also covers the description of different types of solar collectors to facilitate the systematic understanding of solar thermal technology and the novel modifications realized in each category of solar collectors have been highlighted to promote the use of solar energy in routine activities. Performance enhancement techniques such as geometrical modifications on the absorber plate, use of solar selective coatings and nanofluids have been given a special attention.",

		"abstract": "Cluster headache (CH) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches on one side of the head, typically around the eye. There are often accompanying autonomic symptoms during the headache such as eye watering, nasal congestion and swelling around the eye, typically confined to the side of the head with the pain.\nCluster headache belongs to a group of primary headache disorders, classified as the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias or (TACs). Cluster headache is named after the demonstrated grouping of headache attacks occurring together (cluster). Individuals typically experience repeated attacks of excruciatingly severe unilateral headache pain. Cluster headache attacks often occur periodically; spontaneous remissions may interrupt active periods of pain, though about 10–15% of chronic CH never remit. The cause of cluster headache has not been identified.\nWhile there is no known cure, cluster headaches can sometimes be prevented and acute attacks treated. Recommended treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a fast acting triptan. Primary recommended prevention is verapamil. Steroids may be used as a transitional treatment and may prevent attack recurrence until preventative treatments take effect. The condition affects approximately 0.2% of the general population, and men are more commonly affected than women, by a ratio of about 2.5:1 to 3.5:1.",

		"abstract": "Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a familiar experience for the elite or novice athlete. Symptoms can range from muscle tenderness to severe debilitating pain. The mechanisms, treatment strategies, and impact on athletic performance remain uncertain, despite the high incidence of DOMS. DOMS is most prevalent at the beginning of the sporting season when athletes are returning to training following a period of reduced activity. DOMS is also common when athletes are first introduced to certain types of activities regardless of the time of year. Eccentric activities induce micro-injury at a greater frequency and severity than other types of muscle actions. The intensity and duration of exercise are also important factors in DOMS onset. Up to six hypothesised theories have been proposed for the mechanism of DOMS, namely: lactic acid, muscle spasm, connective tissue damage, muscle damage, inflammation and the enzyme efflux theories. However, an integration of two or more theories is likely to explain muscle soreness. DOMS can affect athletic performance by causing a reduction in joint range of motion, shock attenuation and peak torque. Alterations in muscle sequencing and recruitment patterns may also occur, causing unaccustomed stress to be placed on muscle ligaments and tendons. These compensatory mechanisms may increase the risk of further injury if a premature return to sport is attempted. A number of treatment strategies have been introduced to help alleviate the severity of DOMS and to restore the maximal function of the muscles as rapidly as possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated dosage-dependent effects that may also be influenced by the time of administra- tion. Similarly, massage has shown varying results that may be attributed to the time of massage application and the type of massage technique used. Cryotherapy, stretching, homeopathy, ultrasound and electrical current modalities have demon- strated no effect on the alleviation of muscle soreness or other DOMS symptoms. Exercise is the most effective means of alleviating pain during DOMS, however the analgesic effect is also temporary. Athletes who must train on a daily basis should be encouraged to reduce the intensity and duration of exercise for 1–2 days following intense DOMS-inducing exercise. Alternatively, exercises targeting less affected body parts should be encouraged in order to allow the most affected muscle groups to recover. Eccentric exercises or novel activities should be introduced progressively over a period of 1 or 2 weeks at the beginning of, or during, the sporting season in order to reduce the level of physical impairment and/or training disruption. There are still many unanswered questions relating to DOMS, and many potential areas for future research.",

		"abstract": "The 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. GPCRs transduce extracellular signals to the interior of cells through their interaction with G-proteins. The 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors mediate effects of a large variety of compounds affecting depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, hallucinations, dysthymia, sleep patterns, feeding behaviour and neuro-endocrine functions. Binding of such compounds to either 5-HT2 receptor subtype induces processes that regulate receptor sensitivity. In contrast to most other receptors, chronic blockade of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors leads not to an up- but to a (paradoxical) down-regulation. This review deals with published data involving such non-classical regulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies. The underlying regulatory processes of the agonist-induced regulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, commonly thought to be desensitisation and resensitisation, are discussed. The atypical down-regulation of both 5-HT2 receptor subtypes by antidepressants, antipsychotics and 5-HT2 antagonists is reviewed. The possible mechanisms of this paradoxical down-regulation are discussed, and a new hypothesis on possible heterologous regulation of 5-HT2A receptors is proposed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a common bromelain regimen or common ibuprofen regimen are effective in resolving pain and muscle dysfunction associated with delayed onset muscle soreness of the elbow flexors. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blinded, repeated measures design was used for this study. SETTING: The study was performed in the Sports Injury Research Lab at an NCAA Division I university. PARTICIPANTS: Forty subjects who had not participated in an upper body resistance-training program 3 months prior to the study, suffered pain or injury in the nondominant arm, or experienced an adverse response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or pineapple (bromelain source) were recruited. Thirty-nine subjects finished the study. INTERVENTIONS: Active range of motion (ROM), perceived pain, and peak concentric torque measurements of the nondominant arm were taken prior to and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours following an eccentric exercise protocol of the elbow flexors. Subjects were assigned to one of four treatment groups (bromelain 300 mg t.i.d., ibuprofen 400 mg t.i.d., placebo t.i.d., and control) and began treatment immediately following the exercise protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: No differences among treatments were observed for any of the dependent variables at any time. ROM deficits and pain peaked between 48 and 72 hours. Peak torque deficiencies were observed between 24 and 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of bromelain and ibuprofen had no effect on elbow flexor pain, loss of ROM, or loss of concentric peak torque as a result of an eccentric exercise regimen.",

		"abstract": "Heat pipes and thermosyphons—devices of high effective thermal conductivity—have been studied for many years for enhancing the performance of solid, liquid and phase change material (PCM) heat stores. However, as the applications of heat storage widen, from micro-electronics thermal control to concentrated solar heat storage and vehicle thermal management, and even for chemical reactor isothermalization, the challenges facing heat storage increasingly are moving from those associated with the ‘standard' diurnal storage, in itself a problem for low thermal conductivity materials, to response times measured in a few hours or even minutes. While high thermal conductivity metals such as foams can be impregnated with a PCM, for example, to increase local conductivity, the rapid heat input and removal necessitates a more radical approach—heat pipes, possibly with feedback control, with innovative PCM interfaces. This paper reviews the use of heat pipes in conventional and rapid response PCM and liquid or cold storage applications and introduces some novel concepts that might overcome current limitations.",

However, the candidate gene approach is limited by how much is known about the biology of the disease being investigated. The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has been studied more than any other single candidate gene in the field of neurobiology. Transcription of the serotonin transporter gene is modulated by a polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR, near the promoter. 5-HTTLPR genotype has been associated with individual variation in emotion processing, brain structure, and brain function. We present an updated review of the biological literature on the serotonin transporter polymorphism. Recent imaging and behavioral studies of the role of 5-HTTLPR genotype in emotion processing are discussed in light of new biological findings related to 5-HTTLPR variation. We also examine the clinical implications of discoveries about the role of serotonin and 5-HTTLPR genotype in neural plasticity and behavioral malleability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

		"container-title": "Frontiers in Neurology",
		"volume": "4",
		"source": "PubMed Central",
		"abstract": "Modafinil, in its two clinical formulations (Provigil® and Nuvigil®), is a widely prescribed wake-promoting therapeutic agent. It binds competitively to the cell-membrane dopamine (DA) transporter and is dependent on catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and adrenergic) signaling for its wake-promoting effects. The clinical spectrum of effects for modafinil is distinct from the effects seen with other catecholaminergic agents. Relative to other commonly used agents that act through catecholaminergic mechanisms, modafinil has a relatively low abuse potential, produces wakefulness with an attenuated compensatory sleep recovery thereafter, and does not ameliorate cataplexy in narcolepsy. These clinically relevant phenomenological differences between modafinil and agents such as amphetamines and cocaine do not eliminate catecholaminergic effects as a possible mediator of its wake-promoting action; they merely reflect its unique pharmacological profile. Modafinil is an exceptionally weak, but apparently very selective, DA transporter inhibitor. The pharmacodynamic response to modafinil, as measured by DA levels in brain microdialyzate, is protracted relative to other agents that act via catecholaminergic mechanisms. The conformational constraints on the interaction of modafinil with the DA transporter – and probably, as a consequence, its effects on trace amine receptor signaling in the catecholaminergic cell – are unique among catecholaminergic agents. These unique pharmacological properties of modafinil should be considered both in seeking to thoroughly understand its putatively elusive mechanism of action and in the design of novel therapeutic agents.",

		"abstract": "Because of ultralow thermal conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, and better heat resistance than silica aerogel, alumina-based aerogel has drawn great interest as thermal insulators and catalysts. However, it is too fragile and sinters above 1000 °C (it shrinks drastically, \\textgreater50%, and leaves the surface area as low as 10?70 m2/g at 1300 °C), which badly limits its high-temperature applications. Herein, super heat-resistant, strong alumina aerogels are prepared via a novel acetone-aniline in situ water formation (ISWF) method combined with novel modification techniques: supercritical fluid modification (SCFM) and hexamethyldisilazane gas phase modification. The heat resistance of alumina aerogel is enhanced up to 1300 °C via this method. The shrinkage of the optimized alumina aerogel is reduced to as low as 1 and 5% and the corresponding surface area reaches up to 152?261 and 125?136 m2/g after being heated to 1200 and 1300 °C for 2 h, respectively. The strength is significantly increased by more than 120% through SCFM. It also exhibits excellent thermal insulation properties at temperatures up to 1300 °C. This may significantly contribute to their practical ultrahigh-temperature applications in thermal insulations, catalysts, catalyst supports, etc. Because of ultralow thermal conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, and better heat resistance than silica aerogel, alumina-based aerogel has drawn great interest as thermal insulators and catalysts. However, it is too fragile and sinters above 1000 °C (it shrinks drastically, \\textgreater50%, and leaves the surface area as low as 10?70 m2/g at 1300 °C), which badly limits its high-temperature applications.

		"abstract": "The objectives of this study are threefold: 1) to assess whether 7 days of oral glutamine (GLN) supplementation reduces exercise-induced intestinal permeability; 2) whether supplementation prevents the proinflammatory response; and 3) whether these changes are associated with upregulation of the heat shock response. On separate occasions, eight human subjects participated in baseline testing and in GLN and placebo (PLA) supplementation trials, followed by a 60-min treadmill run. Intestinal permeability was higher in the PLA trial compared with baseline and GLN trials (0.0604 ± 0.047 vs. 0.0218 ± 0.008 and 0.0272 ± 0.007, respectively; P < 0.05). IκBα expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was higher 240 min after exercise in the GLN trial compared with the PLA trial (1.411 ± 0.523 vs. 0.9839 ± 0.343, respectively; P < 0.05). In vitro using the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, we measured effects of GLN supplementation (0, 4, and 6 mM) on heat-induced (37° or 41.8°C) heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), and occludin expression. HSF-1 and HSP70 levels increased in 6 mM supplementation at 41°C compared with 0 mM at 41°C (1.785 ± 0.495 vs. 0.6681 ± 0.290, and 1.973 ± 0.325 vs. 1.133 ± 0.129, respectively; P < 0.05). Occludin levels increased after 4 mM supplementation at 41°C and 6 mM at 41°C compared with 0 mM at 41°C (1.236 ± 0.219 and 1.849 ± 0.564 vs. 0.7434 ± 0.027, respectively; P < 0.001). GLN supplementation prevented exercise-induced permeability, possibly through HSF-1 activation.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nExcessive alcohol consumption leads to liver disease. Interorgan crosstalk contributes to ethanol (EtOH)-induced liver injury. EtOH exposure causes gut dysbiosis resulting in negative alterations in intestinal fermentation byproducts, particularly decreased luminal butyrate concentrations. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated the effect of butyrate supplementation, in the form of trybutyrin, as a prophylactic treatment against EtOH-induced gut injury.\n\nMethods:\nC57BL/6J mice were treated with 3 different EtOH feeding protocols: chronic feeding (25 days, 32% of kcal), short-term (2 days, 32%), or acute single gavage (5 g/kg). Tributyrin (0.83 to 10 mM) was supplemented either into the liquid diet or by oral gavage. Intestinal expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and a butyrate receptor and transporter were evaluated, as well as liver enzymes and inflammatory markers.\n\nResults:\nAll 3 EtOH exposure protocols reduced the expression and co-localization of TJ proteins (ZO-1, occludin) and the expression of a butyrate receptor (GPR109A) and transporter (SLC5A8) in the ileum and proximal colon. Importantly, tributyrin supplementation protected against these effects. Protection of the intestine with tributyrin supplementation was accompanied by mitigation of EtOH-induced increases in aspartate aminotransferase and inflammatory measures in the short-term and acute EtOH exposure protocols, but not after chronic EtOH feeding.\n\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest that tributyrin supplementation could serve as a prophylactic treatment against gut injury caused by short-term EtOH exposure.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol (EtOH) decreases protein synthesis and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling and blunts the anabolic response to growth factors in skeletal muscle. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether acute EtOH intoxication antagonizes the contraction-induced increase in protein synthesis and mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle. Fasted male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 g/kg EtOH or saline (control), and the right hindlimb was electrically stimulated (10 sets of 6 contractions). The gastrocnemius muscle complex was collected 30 min, 4 h, or 12 h after stimulation. EtOH decreased in vivo basal protein synthesis (PS) in the nonstimulated muscle compared with time-matched Controls at 30 min, 4 h, and 12 h. In Control, but not EtOH, PS was decreased 15% after 30 min. In contrast, PS was increased in Control 4 h poststimulation but remained unchanged in EtOH. Last, stimulation increased PS 10% in Control and EtOH at 12 h, even though the absolute rate remained reduced by EtOH. The stimulation-induced increase in the phosphorylation of S6K1 Thr421/Ser424 (20–52%), S6K1 Thr389 (45–57%), and its substrate rpS6 Ser240/244 (37–72%) was blunted by EtOH at 30 min, 4 h, and 12 h. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 Ser65 was also attenuated by EtOH (61%) at 4 h. Conversely, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase Thr202/Tyr204 was increased by stimulation in Control and EtOH mice at 30 min but only in Control at 4 h. Our data indicate that acute EtOH intoxication suppresses muscle protein synthesis for at least 12 h and greatly impairs contraction-induced changes in synthesis and mTOR signaling.",

		"abstract": "Background: l-Glutamate (Glu) is a major amino acid in milk and postweaning diets for mammals (including pigs and human infants). However, effects of Glu on intestinal mucosal barrier and antioxidative functions are unknown.\nObjective: This study tested the hypothesis that Glu may enhance the barrier function of intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1) cells by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins.\nMethods: IPEC-1 cells were cultured with or without Glu in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L diquat (an oxidant) for indicated time points. Cell numbers, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), mRNA, and protein abundance of glutamate transporter, the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the abundance of tight junction proteins were determined.\nResults: Compared with 0 mmol/L Glu, 0.5-, 1-, and 2 mmol/L Glu stimulated (P < 0.05) cell growth by 13–37% at 24 h and 12–34% at 48 h, respectively. In addition, 0.5 mmol/L Glu increased (P < 0.05) TEER (by 58% at 24 h and by 98% at 48 h, respectively). These effects of Glu were associated with increased mRNA abundance of Glu transporter solute carrier family 1 member 1 (SLC1A1) by 30–130% and protein abundance of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (encoded by SLC1A1) by 19–34%, respectively. In a cell model of oxidative stress induced by 1 mmol/L diquat, 0.5 mmol/L Glu enhanced cell viability, TEER, and membrane integrity (as indicated by the reduced release of LDH) in IPEC-1 cells by increasing the abundance of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-3, zonula occludens (ZO)-2, and ZO-3.\nConclusion: These findings indicate that Glu plays an important role in mucosal barrier function by enhancing cell growth and maintaining membrane integrity in response to oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "The epithelial and endothelial barriers of the human body are major obstacles for drug delivery to the systemic circulation and to organs with unique environment and homeostasis, like the central nervous system. Several transport routes exist in these barriers, which potentially can be exploited for enhancing drug permeability. Beside the transcellular pathways via transporters, adsorptive and receptor-mediated transcytosis, the paracellular flux for cells and molecules is very limited. While lipophilic molecules can diffuse across the cellular plasma membranes, the junctional complexes restrict or completely block the free passage of hydrophilic molecules through the paracellular clefts. Absorption or permeability enhancers developed in the last 40 years for modifying intercellular junctions and paracellular permeability have unspecific mode of action and the effective and toxic doses are very close. Recent advances in barrier research led to the discovery of an increasing number of integral membrane, adaptor, regulator and signalling proteins in tight and adherens junctions. New tight junction modulators are under development, which can directly target tight or adherens junction proteins, the signalling pathways regulating junctional function, or tight junction associated lipid raft microdomains. Modulators acting directly on tight junctions include peptides derived from zonula occludens toxin, or Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, peptides selected by phage display that bind to integral membrane tight junction proteins, and lipid modulators. They can reversibly increase paracellular transport and drug delivery with less toxicity than previous absorption enhancers, and have a potential to be used as pharmaceutical excipients to improve drug delivery across epithelial barriers and the blood–brain barrier.",

		"abstract": "Previous in vitro studies showed that glutamine (Gln) prevents acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers and human colonic mucosa. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Gln supplementation on ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and liver injury in mice in vivo. Ethanol feeding caused a significant increase in inulin permeability in distal colon. Elevated permeability was associated with a redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins and depletion of detergent-insoluble fractions of these proteins, suggesting that ethanol disrupts apical junctional complexes in colonic epithelium and increases paracellular permeability. Ethanol-induced increase in colonic mucosal permeability and disruption of junctional complexes were most severe in mice fed Gln-free diet. Gln supplementation attenuated ethanol-induced mucosal permeability and disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the potential role of glutamine in nutritional intervention to alcoholic tissue injury. Gln supplementation dose-dependently elevated reduced-protein thiols in colon without affecting the level of oxidized-protein thiols. Ethanol feeding depleted reduced protein thiols and elevated oxidized protein thiols. Ethanol-induced protein thiol oxidation was most severe in mice fed Gln-free diet and absent in mice fed Gln-supplemented diet, suggesting that antioxidant effect is one of the likely mechanisms involved in Gln-mediated amelioration of ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Ethanol feeding elevated plasma transaminase and liver triglyceride, which was accompanied by histopathologic lesions in the liver; ethanol-induced liver damage was attenuated by Gln supplementation. These results indicate that Gln supplementation ameliorates alcohol-induced gut and liver injury.",

In this study, the effects of 20 nonalcoholic beverages on alcohol metabolism and liver injury caused by alcohol were evaluated in mice. Kunming mice were orally fed with alcohol (52%, v/v) and beverages. The concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood as well as the activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in liver were assessed to indicate alcohol metabolism. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in serum as well as the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver were measured to reflect the alcohol-induced liver injury. The results showed that the treatment of soda water, green tea and honey chrysanthemum tea could accelerate ethanol metabolism and prevent liver injuries caused by alcohol when companied with excessive alcohol drinking. They might be potential dietary supplements for the alleviation of harmful effects from excessive alcohol consumption. On the contrary, some beverages such as fresh orange juice and red bull are not advised to drink when companied with alcohol consumption due to their adverse effects on ethanol induced liver injury.",

We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of this formula on signs and symptoms of alcohol hangover (AH). Of the twenty-two symptoms listed, significant decreases in severity scores were shown in nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when the formula was administered in scheduled prophylactic doses. The score in overall well-being, ranging from 0 to 100 (worst possible condition), was 68.9 ± 16.5 (mean ± SD) in the control group and it decreased to 46.9 ± 27.3 and to 44.4 ± 26.4 in the two groups that included a dosing point prior to alcohol ingestion. Regardless of dosing schedules, KSS formula did not alter the time required for complete recovery from AH symptoms. These findings suggest the possibility that KSS formula may become a candidate for AH remedy when administered prophylactically.",

Our research details how BBR protects against gastrointestinal injuries from acute alcohol exposure using both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Acute high alcohol concentrations lead to obvious damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa, resulting in necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. Oral administration of BBR was able to significantly reduce this alcohol-induced damage, inhibit increases of alcohol-induced TNFα and IL-1β expression in gastrointestinal mucosa as well as their upstream signals TLR2 and TLR4, and regulate cytokines that modulate tight junctions. Alcohol consumption is a popular human social behavior worldwide, and the present study reports a comprehensive mechanism by which BBR protects against gastrointestinal injuries from alcohol stress, providing people with a novel application of BBR.",

		"abstract": "Background\nEpidemiologic studies have shown that individuals who consume low to moderate alcohol have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to abstainers. Although experimental studies confirmed this observation, the effect of alcohol on ischemic myocardium is still unclear. We developed a clinically relevant animal model of chronic myocardial ischemia to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on the myocardium.\n\nStudy Design\nFourteen Yorkshire swine underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. Postoperatively, one group was supplemented with 90mL 50% ethanol daily (ETOH n=7), and one group was supplemented with 80g of sucrose daily to normalize caloric intake between groups (SUC n=7). After 7 weeks, all animals underwent sternotomy, and harvest of the chronically ischemic myocardium and non-ischemic myocardium. Tissues were analyzed for protein expression and stained for apoptosis quantification.\n\nResults\nIn the ischemic myocardium, alcohol down-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins TNFα, FOX03, BAD and caspase 9, up-regulated pro-survival proteins AMPK, pAMPK and pFOX03, and down regulated MTOR signaling by down regulating MTOR, pMTOR and up-regulating Deptor. In the non-ischemic myocardium, alcohol up-regulated pro-survival proteins AKT, pAKT, pBCL2, AMPK, pBAD, pFOX03 and down regulated MTOR signaling by down regulating pMTOR and up-regulating Deptor. Alcohol also decreased cell death as measured by TUNEL staining in the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium.\n\nConclusions\nAlcohol consumption down regulates apoptosis and promotes cell survival in the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium. Alcohol also modulates MTOR signaling, which regulates senescence and apoptosis. Perhaps MTOR and apoptosis regulation is another mechanism by which moderate ethanol consumption is cardioprotective.",

		"abstract": "Chronic ethanol consumption induces pancreatic β-cell dysfunction through glucokinase (Gck) nitration and down-regulation, leading to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Gck gene expression and promoter activity in pancreatic β-cells were suppressed by chronic ethanol exposure in vivo and in vitro, whereas expression of activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) and its binding to the putative Atf/Creb site (from −287 to −158 bp) on the Gck promoter were up-regulated. Furthermore, in vitro ethanol-induced Atf3 inhibited the positive effect of Pdx-1 on Gck transcriptional regulation, enhanced recruitment of Hdac1/2 and histone H3 deacetylation, and subsequently augmented the interaction of Hdac1/Pdx-1 on the Gck promoter, which were diminished by Atf3 siRNA. In vivo Atf3-silencing reversed ethanol-mediated Gck down-regulation and β-cell dysfunction, followed by the amelioration of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Together, we identified that ethanol-induced Atf3 fosters β-cell dysfunction via Gck down-regulation and that its loss ameliorates metabolic syndrome and could be a potential therapeutic target in treating type 2 diabetes. The Atf3 gene is associated with the induction of type 2 diabetes and alcohol consumption-induced metabolic impairment and thus may be the major negative regulator for glucose homeostasis.",

		"abstract": "Vascular calcification is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (HSMCs) undergo mineralization in response to elevated levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in an active and well-regulated process. This process involves increased activity of alkaline phosphatase and increased expression of core binding factor α-1 (CBF-α1), a bone-specific transcription factor, with the subsequent induction of osteocalcin. It has been shown that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with greater calcification in coronary arteries. The goal of our study was to examine whether ethanol alters mineralization of HSMCs provoked by high Pi. Exposure of HSMCs to ethanol increased extracellular matrix calcification in a dose responsive manner, providing a significant additional calcium deposition at concentrations of ≥60 mmol/l. HSMC calcification was accompanied by further enhancement in alkaline phosphatase activity. Ethanol also provoked a significant increase in the synthesis of osteocalcin. Moreover, in cells challenged with ethanol the expression of CBF-α1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of osteoblastic transformation of HSMCs, was elevated. The observed effects of ethanol were not due to alterations of phosphate uptake by HSMCs. We conclude that ethanol enhances Pi-mediated human vascular smooth muscle calcification and transition of these cells into osteoblast-like cells.",

		"abstract": "The literature indicates that red wine presents in its composition several substances that are beneficial to health. This study has investigated the antioxidant effects of Tannat red wine on oxidative stress induced by glucose and fructose in erythrocytes in vitro, with the purpose to determine some of its majoritarian phenolic compounds and its antioxidant capacity. Erythrocytes were incubated using different concentrations of glucose and fructose in the presence or absence of wine. From these erythrocytes were determined the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), glucose consumption, and osmotic fragility. Moreover, quantification of total phenolic, gallic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, resveratrol, and DPPH scavenging activity in wine were also assessed. Red wine showed high levels of polyphenols analyzed, as well as high antioxidant potential. Erythrocytes incubated with glucose and fructose had an increase in lipid peroxidation and this was prevented by the addition of wine. The wine increased glucose uptake into erythrocytes and was able to decrease the osmotic fragility of erythrocytes incubated with fructose. Altogether, these results suggest that wine leads to a reduction of the oxidative stress induced by high concentrations of glucose and fructose.",

		"abstract": "The consumption of alcohol is often accompanied by other foods, such as fruits and vegetables. This study is aimed to investigate the effects of 20 selected fruits on ethanol metabolism to find out their potential health benefits and harmful impacts. The effects of the fruits on ethanol metabolism were characterized by the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood, as well as activities of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in liver of mice. Furthermore, potential health benefits and harmful impacts of the fruits were evaluated by biochemical parameters including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase. Generally, effects of these fruits on ethanol metabolism were very different. Some fruits (such as Citrus limon (yellow), Averrhoa carambola, Pyrus spp., and Syzygium samarangense) could decrease the concentration of ethanol in blood. In addition, several fruits (such as Cucumis melo) showed hepatoprotective effects by significantly decreasing AST or ALT level in blood, while some fruits (such as Averrhoa carambola) showed adverse effects. The results suggested that the consumption of alcohol should not be accompanied by some fruits, and several fruits could be developed as functional foods for the prevention and treatment of hangover and alcohol use disorder.",

All 172 participants received either an alcoholic beverage (M=.115 g% breath alcohol concentration [BrAC]) or placebo matched on type and amount one night and a week later received the other beverage. Alcoholic beverages were vodka, bourbon or high alcohol beer. After each drinking session, following a 9-hour period for sleep and breakfast, participants completed questionnaire a hangover measure.\n\nResults\nNo hangover was reported by 24% of participants, mild hangover by 44% and moderate hangover by 32%. Neither alcoholic beverage type nor participant characteristics (sex, age, drinking practices, tobacco use, or family history of alcohol problems) were associated with incidence of hangover.\n\nConclusion\nThe majority of people experienced mild to moderate hangover the morning after this level of intoxication. Further studies are required to investigate other hypothesized causes of variation in the propensity for hangover.",

		"abstract": "Study Objectives:\nTo explore the time of day effects of alcohol on sleep, we examined sleep following alcohol administered at four times of day and three homeostatic loads during a 20-hr forced desynchrony (FD) protocol.\n\nParticipants:\nTwenty-six healthy young adults (21–25 yrs) were studied.\n\nDesign:\nParticipants were dosed at 4 clock times: 0400 (n = 6; 2 females), 1600 (n = 7; 4 females), 1000 (n = 6; 1 female) or 2200 (n = 7; 2 females). Participants slept 2300 to 0800 for at least 12 nights before the in-lab FD study. Double blind placebo and alcohol (vodka tonic targeting 0.05g% concentration) beverages were each administered three times during FD at different homeostatic loads: low (4.25 or 2.24 hrs awake), medium (8.25 or 6.25 hrs awake), high (12.25 or 10.25 hrs awake) in the 0400 and 1600 or 1000 and 2200 groups, respectively. Sleep was staged and subjected to spectral analysis.\n\nMeasurements and Results:\nBreath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) confirmed targeted maximal levels. At bedtime, BrAC was 0 in the low and medium homeostatic load conditions; however, at high homeostatic load, BrAC was still measurable. Spectral characteristics of sleep were unaffected with alcohol at any time of day. Few alcohol related changes were seen for sleep stages; however, with alcohol given at 0400 at a high homeostatic load there was an increase in wake.\n\nConclusions:\nThese data lend support to the idea that alcohol may be disruptive to sleep; however, our findings are inconsistent with the idea that a low dose of alcohol is a useful sleep aid when attempting to sleep at an adverse circadian phase.\n\nCitation:\nVan Reen E; Tarokh L; Rupp TL; Seifer R; Carskadon MA.

Corresponding mood changes comprised increased feelings of depression, anger–hostility, fatigue, and reduced vigor–activity. In contrast, hangover-immune drinkers reported relatively few hangover symptoms, with only mild corresponding severity scores. The reported symptoms were limited to drowsiness-related symptoms such as sleepiness and being tired.

		"abstract": "Introduction\nPrevious research has shown that heavy cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on neurocognitive functions. Animal studies suggest that chronic cannabis consumption may also produce cross-tolerance for the impairing effects of alcohol, but supportive data in humans is scarce.\n\nPurpose\nThe present study was designed to assess tolerance and cross-tolerance to the neurocognitive effects of THC and alcohol in heavy cannabis users.\n\nMethods\nTwenty-one heavy cannabis users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way study. Subjects underwent three alcohol-dosing conditions that were designed to achieve a steady blood alcohol concentration of about 0, 0.5, and 0.7 mg/ml during a 5-h time window. In addition, subjects smoked a THC cigarette (400 μg/kg) at 3 h post-onset of alcohol dosing during every alcohol condition. Performance tests were conducted repeatedly between 0 and 7 h after onset of drinking and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided-attention task), motor inhibition (stop-signal task), and cognition (Tower of London).\n\nResults\nAlcohol significantly impaired critical tracking, divided attention, and stop-signal performance. THC generally did not affect task performance. However, combined effects of THC and alcohol on divided attention were bigger than those by alcohol alone.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the present study generally confirms that heavy cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing effects of THC on neurocognitive task performance. Yet, heavy cannabis users did not develop cross-tolerance to the impairing effects of alcohol, and the presence of the latter even selectively potentiated THC effects on measures of divided attention.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThe Hangover Symptoms Scale (HSS) assesses the frequency of 13 symptoms experienced after drinking in the past year. Cross-sectional analyses in college drinkers showed preliminary evidence for the validity of the HSS (). The current investigation extended this work by examining the construct validity of the HSS in an ecological momentary assessment investigation.\n\nMethods\nFrequent drinkers (N = 404) carried electronic diaries to track their daily experiences over three weeks. Each morning, the diary assessed prior-night drinking behaviors, the presence of current hangover, and intensity of current headache and nausea.\n\nResults\nAdjusting for sex and body mass, the HSS significantly predicted diary endorsement of hangover (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.78–2.49, p <.001). Participants who endorsed the HSS headache and nausea items were especially likely to report elevations of corresponding symptoms in diary records made the morning after drinking. HSS scores incrementally predicted hangover when the number of drinks consumed in the episode was covaried but did not moderate the relationship between the number of drinks and diary hangover reports.\n\nConclusions\nThe HSS appears to be a valid tool for hangover research. Higher HSS scores identify individuals who complain of “real world” hangovers and who may be especially likely to display particular symptoms after a night of drinking. Past hangovers predicted future hangovers, suggesting hangovers do not necessarily discourage or inhibit future drinking, at least across the several-week time interval studied here. There is a need to develop and evaluate complementary measures that can more directly index individual differences in hangover susceptibility in survey designs.",

Trials were considered if they were placebo controlled or controlled against a comparator intervention. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were read and hard copies were obtained. The selection of studies, data extraction, and validation were done independently by two reviewers. The Jadad score was used to evaluate methodological quality., Results Fifteen potentially relevant trials were identified. Seven publications failed to meet all inclusion criteria. Eight randomised controlled trials assessing eight different interventions were reviewed. The agents tested were propranolol, tropisetron, tolfenamic acid, fructose or glucose, and the dietary supplements Borago officinalis (borage), Cynara scolymus (artichoke), Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear), and a yeast based preparation. All studies were double blind. Significant intergroup differences for overall symptom scores and individual symptoms were reported only for tolfenamic acid, γ linolenic acid from B officinalis, and a yeast based preparation., Conclusion No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover.

Research on predictors of hangover sensitivity may provide clues about such mechanisms. The present study investigated whether tobacco smoking on days of heavy drinking affects next-day hangover incidence and severity.\n\nMethod:\nThe study drew on diary data from a study on smoking and drinking among 113 students at a midwestern university in the United States. Participants completed a daily, web-based, 26-item survey for 8 weeks to assess prior-day alcohol and tobacco use as well as current-day hangover symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test the hypothesis that amount of smoking is related to hangover, controlling for amount of alcohol consumed, sex, and other individual characteristics. Analyses were conducted after selecting only days with alcohol consumption levels that typically elicit hangover, then repeated on lighter drinking days for comparison. Validityof the hangover items was checked by comparing reports after such heavy drinking days with days of lighter drinking.\n\nResults:\nAcross all possible person-days, 92% of daily reports were obtained. When selecting only events where an estimated blood alcohol concentration of 110 mg/dl was attained, smoking significantly increased the odds of hangover incidence and hangover severity while controlling for number of drinks consumed and sex. Additional analyses controlling for age first smoked regularly, frequency of drug use, type of drug involvement, or smoking status resulted in findings that were unchanged.\n\nConclusions:\nSmoking more on heavy drinking days affects hangover sensitivity and severity, possibly because of acute pharmacological effects.",

However, few rigorous clinical trials have assessed the effects of artichoke extract, and none has examined the effects in relation to hangovers. We undertook this study to test whether artichoke extract is effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover.\n\nMethods\nWe recruited healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial. Participants received either 3 capsules of commercially available standardized artichoke extract or indistinguishable, inert placebo capsules immediately before and after alcohol exposure. After a 1-week washout period the volunteers received the opposite treatment. Participants predefined the type and amount of alcoholic beverage that would give them a hangover and ate the same meal before commencing alcohol consumption on the 2 study days. The primary outcome measure was the difference in hangover severity scores between the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. Secondary outcome measures were differences between the interventions in scores using a mood profile questionnaire and cognitive performance tests administered 1 hour before and 10 hours after alcohol exposure. \n\nResults\nFifteen volunteers participated in the study. The mean number (and standard deviation) of alcohol units (each unit being 7.9 g, or 10 mL, of ethanol) consumed during treatment with artichoke extract and placebo was 10.7 (3.1) and 10.5 (2.4) respectively, equivalent to 1.2 (0.3) and 1.2 (0.2) g of alcohol per kilogram body weight. The volume of nonalcoholic drink consumed and the duration of sleep were similar during the artichoke extract and placebo interventions. None of the outcome measures differed significantly between interventions. Adverse events were rare and were mild and transient.\n\nInterpretation\nOur results suggest that artichoke extract is not effective in preventing the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.",

Sleep latency tests and Biphasic Effects of Alcohol Scale (BAES) were administered on each forced desynchrony day. The outcome variables for this study include sleep onset latency (SOL) and stimulation and sedation value (from the BAES). Each outcome variable was associated with the ascending or descending limb of the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) curve and assigned a circadian phase within a 90° bin.\n\nMeasurements and Results:\nBrAC confirmed targeted maximal levels. Only outcome variables associated with the ascending and descending limb of the alcohol curve were analyzed for this article. Alcohol administered at a circadian time associated with greatest sleepiness showed longer SOL compared with placebo when measured on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve. We also found longer SOL with alcohol on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve in a circadian bin that favors greatest alertness. We observed shorter SOLs on the descending limb of the BrAC curve, but with no circadian phase interaction. The subjective data were partially consistent with the objective data.\n\nConclusions:\nThe physiologic findings in this study support the biphasic stimulating and sedating properties of alcohol, but limit the effect to specific circadian times.\n\nCitation:\nVan Reen E; Rupp TL; Acebo C; Seifer R; Carskadon MA.

Following screening polysomnography, participants consumed alcohol (sex/weight adjusted dosing) to intoxication (peak breath alcohol concentration [BrAC] of 0.11 ± 0.01 g% for men and women) or matching placebo between 2030 and 2200 hours. Sleep was monitored with polysomnography between 2300 and 0700 hours. Participants completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale at bedtime and on awakening and a validated post-sleep questionnaire.\n\nResults\nFollowing alcohol, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, nighttime awakenings, and wake after sleep onset were more disrupted in women than men, with no differences by family history status. Alcohol reduced sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and REM sleep while increasing wakefulness and Slow Wave Sleep across the entire night compared to placebo. Alcohol also generally increased sleep consolidation in the first half of the night, but decreased it during the second half. Sleepiness ratings were higher following alcohol, particularly in women at bedtime. Morning sleep quality ratings were lower following alcohol than placebo.\n\nConclusions\nAlcohol intoxication increases subjective sleepiness and disrupts sleep objectively more in healthy women than in men, with no differences evident by family history of alcoholism status. Evaluating moderators of alcohol effects on sleep may provide insight into the role of sleep in problem drinking.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the presence and severity of hangover symptoms, and determine their interrelationship. Methods: A survey was conducted among n = 1410 Dutch students examining their drinking behavior and latest alcohol hangover. The severity of 47 presumed hangover symptoms were scored on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (maximal). Factor analysis was conducted to summarize the data into groups of associated symptoms that contribute significantly to the alcohol hangover and symptoms that do not. Results: About half of the participants (56.1%, n = 791) reported having had a hangover during the past month. Most commonly reported and most severe hangover symptoms were fatigue (95.5%) and thirst (89.1%). Factor analysis revealed 11 factors that together account for 62% of variance. The most prominent factor ‘drowsiness’ (explained variance 28.8%) included symptoms such as drowsiness, fatigue, sleepiness and weakness. The second factor ‘cognitive problems’ (explained variance 5.9%) included symptoms such as reduced alertness, memory and concentration problems. Other factors, including the factor ‘disturbed water balance’ comprising frequently reported symptoms such as ‘dry mouth’ and ‘thirst’, contributed much less to the overall hangover (explained variance <5%). Conclusion: Drowsiness and impaired cognitive functioning are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover.",

		"abstract": "Hangover may be related to propensity to develop alcohol use disorders (AUDs). However, the etiological role, if any, played by hangover in AUD is unclear. From a motivational perspective, hangover can be construed as either a deterrent to future alcohol consumption or a setting event for negative reinforcement that could promote deviant drinking practices (e.g., “hair-of-the-dog” drinking). Hangover could be related to AUD risk even if it does not play a direct role in promoting or inhibiting near-term drinking. For example, measures of hangover might serve as symptoms of AUD or as markers of individual differences that more directly account for AUD risk. Empirical evidence (though usually indirect) exists to support contentions that hangover is related to both risk for and protection from AUD. In this article, we briefly address variation in assessment strategies in existing hangover research because measures of hangover frequency and hangover susceptibility may prove to have different correlates. Next, we review the existing, limited evidence on relations between hangover and AUD risk. Finally, we sketch a variety of theoretically-informed hypotheses that might help delineate productive lines of inquiry for this emerging field.",

		"abstract": "The excessive intake of alcohol is a serious public health problem, especially given the severe damage provoked by chronic or prenatal exposure to alcohol that affects many physiological processes, such as memory, motor function, and cognitive abilities. This damage is related to the ethanol oxidation in the brain. The metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetate is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species that accentuate the oxidative state of cells. This metabolism of ethanol can induce the oxidation of the fatty acids in phospholipids, and the bioactive aldehydes produced are known to be associated with neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. As such, here we will review the role of lipids in the neuronal damage induced by ethanol-related oxidative stress and the role that lipids play in the related compensatory or defense mechanisms.",

		"abstract": "Gene variants encoding several of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), are among the largest genetic associations with risk for alcohol dependence. Certain genetic variants (i.e., alleles)—particularly the ADH1B*2, ADH1B*3, ADH1C*1, and ALDH2*2 alleles—have been associated with lower rates of alcohol dependence. These alleles may lead to an accumulation of acetaldehyde during alcohol metabolism, which can result in heightened subjective and objective effects. The prevalence of these alleles differs among ethnic groups; ADH1B*2 is found frequently in northeast Asians and occasionally Caucasians, ADH1B*3 is found predominantly in people of African ancestry, ADH1C*1 varies substantially across populations, and ALDH2*2 is found almost exclusively in northeast Asians. Differences in the prevalence of these alleles may account at least in part for ethnic differences in alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, these alleles do not act in isolation to influence the risk of AUD. For example, the gene effects of ALDH2*2 and ADH1B*2 seem to interact. Moreover, other factors have been found to influence the extent to which these alleles affect a person’s alcohol involvement, including developmental stage, individual characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, antisocial behavior, and behavioral undercontrol), and environmental factors (e.g., culture, religion, family environment, and childhood adversity).",

		"abstract": "Converging evidence indicates an association of the short (s), low-expressing variant of the repeat length polymorphism, serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), in the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) with anxiety-related traits and increased risk for depression in interaction with psychosocial adversity across the life span. However, genetically driven deficient serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function would not have been maintained throughout evolution if it only exerted negative effects without conveying any gain of function. Here, we review recent findings that humans and nonhuman primates carrying the s variant of the 5-HTTLPR outperform subjects carrying the long allele in an array of cognitive tasks and show increased social conformity. In addition, studies in 5-HTT knockout rodents are included that provide complementary insights in the beneficial effects of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele. We postulate that hypervigilance, mediated by hyperactivity in corticolimbic structures, may be the common denominator in the anxiety-related traits and (social) cognitive superiority of s-allele carriers and that environmental conditions determine whether a response will turn out to be negative (emotional) or positive (cognitive, in conformity with the social group). Taken together, these findings urge for a conceptual change in the current deficit-oriented connotation of the 5-HTTLPR variants. In fact, these factors may counterbalance or completely offset the negative consequences of the anxiety-related traits. This notion may not only explain the modest effect size of the 5-HTTLPR and inconsistent reports but may also lead to a more refined appreciation of allelic variation in 5-HTT function. ?? 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",

		"abstract": "Dielectric-barrier discharges (silent discharges) are used on a large industrial scale. They combine the adûantages of non-equilibrium plasma properties with the ease of atmospheric-pressure operation. A prominent feature is the simple scalability from small laboratory reactors to large industrial installations with megawatt input powers. Efficient and cost-effectiûe all-solid-state power supplies are aûailable. The preferred frequency range lies between 1 kHz and 10 MHz, the preferred pressure range between 10 kPa and 500 kPa. Industrial applications include ozone gener- ation, pollution control, surface treatment, high power CO lasers, ultraûiolet excimer lamps, excimer based mercury-free fluorescent lamps, and flat large-area plasma displays. Depending on the application and the operating conditions the discharge can haûe pronounced filamentary structure or fairly diffuse appearance. History, discharge physics, and plasma chemistry of dielectric-barrier discharges and their applications are discussed in detail",

		"abstract": "An athlete's carbohydrate intake can be judged by whether total daily intake and the timing of consumption in relation to exercise maintain adequate carbohydrate substrate for the muscle and central nervous system (\"high carbohydrate availability\") or whether carbohydrate fuel sources are limiting for the daily exercise programme (\"low carbohydrate availability\"). Carbohydrate availability is increased by consuming carbohydrate in the hours or days prior to the session, intake during exercise, and refuelling during recovery between sessions. This is important for the competition setting or for high-intensity training where optimal performance is desired. Carbohydrate intake during exercise should be scaled according to the characteristics of the event. During sustained high-intensity sports lasting ∼1 h, small amounts of carbohydrate, including even mouth-rinsing, enhance performance via central nervous system effects. While 30-60 g · h(-1) is an appropriate target for sports of longer duration, events \\textgreater2.5 h may benefit from higher intakes of up to 90 g · h(-1). Products containing special blends of different carbohydrates may maximize absorption of carbohydrate at such high rates. In real life, athletes undertake training sessions with varying carbohydrate availability. Whether implementing additional \"train-low\" strategies to increase the training adaptation leads to enhanced performance in well-trained individuals is unclear.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the main characteristics of monolithic silica aerogel and its application in evacuated superinsulating aerogel glazing including the evacuation and assembling process. Furthermore, the energetic benefit of aerogel glazing is quantified. In evacuated aerogel glazing the space between the glass panes is filled with monolithic silica aerogel evacuated to a rough vacuum of approximately 1-10 hPa. The aerogel glazing does not depend on use of low emissive coatings that have the drawback of absorbing a relatively large part of the solar radiation that otherwise could reduce the space heating demand in residential buildings. The U-value of the glazing can be designed to meet the required value by increasing the monolithic silica aerogel thickness without the need for additional layers of glass. An aerogel glazing with 20 mm glass distance can reach a U-value below 0.5 W/(m2 K) combined with a solar energy transmittance above 0.75. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.",

The system, which has potential applications in crop drying and poultry egg incubation, consists of a single-glazed flat plate solar collector integrated with a phase change material (PCM) heat storage system. The PCM is prepared in modules, with the modules equispaced across the absorber plate. The spaces between the module pairs serve as the air heating channels, the channels being connected to common air inlet and discharge headers. The system was tested experimentally under daytime no-load conditions at Nsukka, Nigeria, over the ambient temperature range of 19-41 ??C, and a daily global irradiation range of 4.9-19.9 MJ m-2. Peak temperature rise of the heated air was about 15 K, while the maximum airflow rate and peak cumulative useful efficiency were about 0.058 kg s-1 and 22%, respectively. These results show that the system can be operated successfully for crop drying applications. With suitable valves to control the working chamber temperature, it can also operate as a poultry egg incubator. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Contemporary approaches to biology often call for the high-throughput production of large amounts of numerous proteins for structural or functional studies. Even with the highly efficient protein expression systems developed in Escherichia coli, production of these proteins is laborious and time-consuming. We have simplified established protocols by the use of disposable culture vessels: common 2-liter polyethylene terephthalate beverage bottles. The bottles are inexpensive, fit conveniently in commonly available flask holders, and, because they are notched, provide sufficient aeration to support the growth of high-density cultures. The use of antibiotics and freshly prepared media alleviates the need for sterilization of media and significantly reduces the labor involved. Uninoculated controls exhibited no growth during the time required for protein expression in experimental cultures. The yield, solubility, activity, and pattern of crystallization of proteins expressed in bottles were comparable to those obtained under conventional culture conditions. After use, the bottles are discarded, reducing the risk of cross-contamination of subsequent cultures. The approach appears to be suitable for high-throughput production of proteins for structural or functional studies.",

		"page": "483–503",
		"volume": "38",
		"issue": "6",
		"abstract": "Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) can be caused by novel or unaccustomed exercise and results in a temporary decrease in muscle force production, a rise in passive tension, increased muscle soreness and swelling, and an increase in intramuscular proteins in blood. Consequently, EIMD can have a profound effect on the ability to perform subsequent bouts of exercise and therefore adhere to an exercise training programme. A variety of interventions have been used prophylactically and/or therapeutically in an attempt to reduce the negative effects associated with EIMD. This article focuses on some of the most commonly used strategies, including nutritional and pharmacological strategies, electrical and manual therapies and exercise. Long-term supplementation with antioxidants or beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate appears to provide a prophylactic effect in reducing EIMD, as does the ingestion of protein before and following exercise. Although the administration of high-dose NSAIDs may reduce EIMD and muscle soreness, it also attenuates the adaptive processes and should therefore not be prescribed for long-term treatment of EIMD. Whilst there is some evidence that stretching and massage may reduce muscle soreness, there is little evidence indicating any performance benefits. Electrical therapies and cryotherapy offer limited effect in the treatment of EIMD; however, inconsistencies in the dose and frequency of these and other interventions may account for the lack of consensus regarding their efficacy. Both as a cause and a consequence of this, there are very few evidence-based guidelines for the application of many of these interventions. Conversely, there is unequivocal evidence that prior bouts of eccentric exercise provide a protective effect against subsequent bouts of potentially damaging exercise. Further research is warranted to elucidate the most appropriate dose and frequency of interventions to attenuate EIMD and if these interventions attenuate the adaptation process. This will both clarify the efficacy of such strategies and provide guidelines for evidence-based practice.",

		"volume": "225",
		"abstract": "The usual production of silica aerogels include supercritical drying and expensive raw materials like tetraethoxysilane which prohibit a commercialization. To avoid the costs of supercritical drying one can modify the internal surface with a silation agent. Hydrophobization of the lyogel makes it possible to dry at ambient pressure. The next step is to use waterglass as a cheaper silica source. This requires at least one solvent exchange from water for the surface modification. The diffusion time for solvent exchange and recycling of the water/solvent solutions by distillation cause considerable costs. A new cost-effective process has been developed to avoid these disadvantages. Silation is now carried out directly in the water phase of the hydrogel, which results in solvent exchange as well as phase separation of gelwater and solvent.",

The large-scale growth and expression uses a chemically defined auto-induction medium containing 125 mg L-1 selenomethionine, salts and trace metals, other amino acids including 10 mg L-1 of methionine, vitamins except vitamin B12, and glucose, glycerol, and ??-lactose. A schematic for a shaker rack that can hold up to twenty-four 2-L polyethylene terephthalate beverage bottles in a standard laboratory refrigerated floor shaker is provided. The growth cycle from inoculation of the culture bottle through the growth, induction, and expression was timed to take ???24 h. Culture growth in the auto-induction medium gave an average final optical density at 600 nm of ???6 and an average wet cell mass yield of ???14 g from 2 L of culture in greater than 150 expression trials. A simple method for visual scoring of denaturing electrophoresis gels for total protein expression, solubility, and effectiveness of fusion protein proteolysis was developed and applied. For the favorably scored expression trials, the average yield of purified, selenomethionine-labeled target protein obtained after proteolysis of the fusion protein was ???30 mg. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed greater than 90% incorporation of selenomethionine over a ???8-fold range of selenomethionine concentrations in the growth medium, with higher growth rates observed at the lower selenomethionine concentrations.

		"abstract": "Porous silica was synthesized via the sol-gel process using clay obtained locally from Ijero-Ekiti in Ekiti State, Nigeria and compared with silica synthesized under similar conditions from sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3) obtained comer- cially. The clay was initially refluxed with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 2 hours to extract SiO2 to form Na2SiO3, which was subsequently hydrolyzed to form a gel. The gel obtained was washed with deionized water to get rid of im-purities, dried and calcined at 800°C for 3 hours. The obtained silica powders were characterized using atomic absorp-tion spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the vibrational modes and diffraction patterns of the silica derived from com-mercial Na2SiO3 and that prepared from clay were similar containing pure amorphous SiO2. The morphology of the commercially obtained silica showed better arrangement of particles and exhibited slightly lesser porosity (62.4%) compared to that derived from clay which had a porosity of 65.5%. The result indicates that clay has a potential for use as an environmentally safe and economic starting material for preparing porous silica instead of high quality precursors.",

In this study, a ground-source heat pump-phase change material (GSHP-PCM) latent heat storage system was developed to use natural energy, to the extent possible, for thermal environment control of the greenhouse. The coefficient of performance of the heat pump (COPHP), that of the overall system (COPsys) and the energy capacity of the PCM during the charge-discharge phases has been determined. Based upon the measurements made in the heating mode from 1 September 2005 till 30 April 2006 in Elazi{dotless}??, Turkey, the average heating COPHP of the GSHP unit and the overall system COPsys were obtained to be in the range of 2.3-3.8 and 2-3.5, respectively.

The highest level of nitrate was detected in curly kale (302.0 mg/kg) and the lowest in green cauliflower (61.0 mg/kg). As for nitrite, the respective levels were found in white cauliflower (3.49 mg/kg) and green cauliflower (1.47 mg/kg). Both blanching and boiling of the cruciferous vegetables caused a considerable decrease in the total nitrate content, but at the same time no explicit changes were noted regarding the level of nitrite. In the vegetables stored frozen for 48 h, previously blanched, either an increase or no change was observed in the nitrate level, with the changes in the nitrite level being irregular. In the vegetables stored frozen for 4 months, previously blanched, generally a decrease was noted in the nitrate, and an increase in the nitrite level compared to the levels in the blanched vegetables. Boiling of the frozen vegetables (stored frozen for 48 h) most frequently caused a considerable reduction of the nitrate level in comparison to the content in the raw frozen vegetables. No changes were observed resulting from the boiling of the vegetables previously stored frozen for 4 months. Simultaneously, no explicit changes were found regarding the nitrite level in the frozen vegetable after boiling. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "We evaluated the cooling rate of hyperthermic subjects, as measured by three estimates of deep core temperatures (esophageal, rectal and aural canal temperatures), during immersion in a range of water temperatures. The objective of the study was to compare the three indices of core temperature and define safe cooling limits when using rectal temperature to avoid the development of hypothermia. On 4 separate days, seven subjects (four males, three females) exercised for 45.4+/-4.1 min at 65% V(O2)max at an ambient temperature of 39 degrees C, RH: 36.5%, until rectal temperature (T (re)) increased to 40.0 degrees C (39.5 degrees C for two subjects). Following exercise, the subjects were immersed in a circulated water bath controlled at 2, 8, 14 and 20 degrees C until T (re) returned to 37.5 degrees C. When T (re) reached normothermia during the cooling period (37.5+/-0.05 degrees C), both esophageal (T (es)) (35.6+/-1.3 degrees C) and aural canal (T (ac)) (35.9+/-0.9 degrees C) temperatures were approaching or reaching hypothermia, particularly during immersion in 2 degrees C water (T (es)=34.5+/-1.2 degrees C). On the basis of the heat loss data, the heat gained during the exercise was fully eliminated after 5.4+/-1.5, 7.9+/-2.9, 10.4+/-3.8 and 13.1+/-2.8 min of immersion in 2, 8, 14 and 20 degrees C water, respectively, with the coldest water showing a significantly faster cooling rate. During the immersion in 2 degrees C water, a decrease of only 1.5 degrees C in T (re) resulted in the elimination of 100% of the heat gained during exercise without causing hypothermia. This study would therefore support cooling the core temperature of hyperthermic subjects to a rectal temperature between 37.8 degrees C (during immersion in water \\textgreater10 degrees C) and 38.6 degrees C (during immersion in water \\textless10 degrees C) to eliminate the heat gained during exercise without causing hypothermia.",

		"volume": "116",
		"abstract": "Molten-salt thermocline tanks are a low-cost energy storage option for concentrating solar power plants. Despite the potential economic advantage, the capacity of thermocline tanks to store sufficient amounts of high-temperature heat is limited by the low energy density of the constituent sensible-heat storage media. A promising design modification replaces conventional rock filler inside the tank with an encapsulated phase-change material (PCM), contributing a latent heat storage mechanism to increase the overall energy density. The current study presents a new finite-volume approach to simulate mass and energy transport inside a latent heat thermocline tank at low computational cost. This storage model is then integrated into a system-level model of a molten-salt power tower plant to inform tank operation with respect to realistic solar collection and power production. With this system model, PCMs with different melting temperatures and heats of fusion are evaluated for their viability in latent heat storage for solar plants.Thermocline tanks filled with a single PCM do not yield a substantial increase in annual storage or plant output over a conventional rock-filled tank of equal size. As the melting temperature and heat of fusion are increased, the ability of the PCM to support steam generation improves but the corresponding ability of the thermocline tank to utilize this available latent heat decreases. This trend results from an inherent deconstruction of the heat-exchange region inside the tank between sensible and latent heat transfer, preventing effective use of the added phase change for daily plant operations. This problem can be circumvented with a cascaded filler structure composed of multiple PCMs with their melting temperatures tuned along the tank height. However, storage benefits with these cascaded tank structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the proper selection of the PCM melting points relative to the thermocline tank operating temperatures. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

		"abstract": "An improved structure of flat-plate solar heat collector applied in construction of the solar water heater system is proposed in this paper. The collector uses one large integrated wickless heat pipe instead of side-by-side separate heat pipes. High stability and leak avoidance between the water cooling side and the solar heating side are the main advantages. The present work includes three aspects. Firstly, an experiment was conducted to test thermal performance of the new collector on July 9, 2011. After a daily work from 09:00 to 16:00, the maximum collector efficiency could reach 66%, while the temperature of water of 200. kg in the storage tank increased by about 25.0. °C in the end. Secondly, a theoretical analysis on the energy balance for each component of the collector was made to understand the heat transfer process inside the collector. Thirdly, a transient heat transfer model has been developed to calculate the collector efficiency, temperatures of water, the glass cover and the absorber plate, of which the simulation results are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

By the latter part of the 19th century, neuronal theories had also been well articulated (Liveing, 1873) and, indeed, Gowers (1888) seemed happy with that concept. It is remarkable that three key approaches revived the vascular theory in the mid- to late-20th century; and the same three key areas—human experimental studies, observations on vascular change and therapeutics—have, some 120 years later, put migraine back into the brain, and thus firmly into the domain of neurology.\n\nThis issue of Brain describes a study with exactly the type of result that lead Wolff to think of migraine as vascular; yet, taken in context, it provides evidence that leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.

Recent results establish protective roles for NAD(+) that might be applicable therapeutically to prevent neurodegenerative conditions and to fight Candida glabrata infection. In addition, the contribution that NAD(+) metabolism makes to lifespan extension in model systems indicates that therapies to boost NAD(+) might promote some of the beneficial effects of calorie restriction.

The distinct and tissue-specific biosynthetic and/or ligand activities of tryptophan, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and the newly identified NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide riboside, reviewed herein, are responsible for vitamin-specific effects and side effects. Because current data suggest that nicotinamide riboside may be the only vitamin precursor that supports neuronal NAD+ synthesis, we present prospects for human nicotinamide riboside supplementation and propose areas for future research.",

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1,2/protein kinase C (PKC) system is one such network that regulates many cellular machines, including the cell cycle machinery and autocrine/paracrine factor synthesizing machinery. We used a combination of computational analysis and experiments in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to understand the design principles of this controller network. We find that the growth factor stimulated signaling network containing MAPK 1,2/PKC can operate with one (monostable) or two (bistable) stable states. At low concentrations of MAPK phosphatase, the system exhibits bistable behavior, such that brief stimulus results in sustained MAPK activation. The MAPK-induced increase in the amounts of MAPK phosphatase eliminates the prolonged response capability and moves the network to a monostable state, in which it behaves as a proportional response system responding acutely to stimulus. Thus, the MAPK 1,2/PKC controller network is flexibly designed, and MAPK phosphatase may be critical for this flexible response.",

Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases play a critical role in this process. In the present study, we have addressed the role of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in regulating proinflammatory cytokine production using RAW264.7 macrophages. Analysis of MAP kinase activity revealed a transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 after LPS stimulation. Interestingly, MKP-1 was induced concurrently with the inactivation of JNK and p38, whereas blocking MKP-1 induction by triptolide prevented this inactivation. Ectopic expression of MKP-1 accelerated JNK and p38 inactivation and substantially inhibited the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Induction of MKP-1 by LPS was found to be extracellular signal-regulated kinase dependent and involved enhanced gene expression and increased protein stability. Finally, MKP-1 expression was also induced by glucocorticoids as well as cholera toxin B subunit, an agent capable of preventing autoimmune diseases in animal models. These findings highlight MKP-1 as a critical negative regulator of the macrophage inflammatory response, underscoring its premise as a potential target for developing novel anti-inflammatory drugs.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of black tea on antioxidant abilities of the liver, blood serum-and brain of 12-months old rats sub-chronically (for 28 days) intoxicated with ethanol. Administration of black tea alone caused increase in the activity and concentration of antioxidant parameters more extensively in the liver and serum than in the brain. Alcohol caused decrease in the liver glutathione peroxidase and reductase and catalase activity but increase in activity of superoxide dismutase. Moreover, decrease in the level of nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione, vitamin C, A and E and beta-carotene was observed. The activity of serum glutathione peroxidase and reductase decreased while superoxide dismutase activity was not changed. The level of non-enzymatic antioxidants in serum was also decreased. However brain activity/level of all examined antioxidants enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic was decreased after ethanol intoxication. Black tea considerably prevented antioxidant parameters against changes caused by ethanol. These results indicate beneficial antioxidant effect of black tea: regarding all examined tissues, but especially the liver. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Methods: Twenty-five patients received 1000 I.U. of vitamin E per day, while 26 patients received placebo for 3 months. The patients were followed for 1 year after entry into the trial. Results: Vitamin E did not result in significant greater decreases in serum aminotransferases and serum bilirubin or in greater increases in serum albumin as compared with placebo. Prothrombin time did not change, while serum creatinine remained in the normal range. Monocyte nuclear nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity decreased in patients who remained abstinent, regardless of whether they received vitamin E. As regards markers of hepatic fibrogenesis, vitamin E treatment decreased serum hyaluronic acid (P < 0.05) while serum aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen did not change in either group. Four patients in the treatment group and five in the placebo group died during the 1-year study.

		"abstract": "Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy stilbene), a phytoalexin found in the skin and seeds of grapes, has been reported to possess antiinflammatory. anticarcinogenic. and antioxidant activities. In this work, we assessed the ability of resveratrol to upregulate heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression via activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Cultured PC12 cells. Nrf2 is a transcription factor involved in the cellular protection against oxidative stress through antioxidant response element (ARE)-directed induction of several phase 2 detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, such as HO-1. Here, we report that resveratrol induces HO-1 expression via the ARE-mediated transcriptional activation of Nrf2. Moreover, PC 12 cells treated with resveratrol exhibited transient activation of Akt/protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). LY294002 and U0126, pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MEK1/2 which are upstream of Akt and ERK1/2, respectively, attenuated resveratrol-induced HO-1 expression and exhibited antioxidant effects. Taken together, the above findings suggest that resveratrol augments cellular antioxidant defense capacity through induction of HO-1 via Nrf2-ARE signaling, thereby protecting PC12 cells from oxidative stress.

		"abstract": "TNF alpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that induces either cell proliferation or cell death. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation increases susceptibility to TNF alpha-induced death, concurrent with sustained JNK activation, an important contributor to the death response. Sustained JNK activation in NF-kappa B-deficient cells was suggested to depend on reactive oxygen species (ROS), but how RIDS affect JNK activation was unclear. We now show that TNF alpha-induced ROS, whose accumulation is suppressed by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cause oxidation and inhibition of JNK-inactivating phosphatases by converting their catalytic cysteine to sulfenic acid. This results in sustained JNK activation, which is required for cytochrome c release and caspase 3 cleavage, as well as necrotic cell death. Treatment of cells or experimental animals with an antioxidant prevents H(2)O(2) accumulation, JNK phosphatase oxidation, sustained JNK activity, and both forms of cell death. Antioxidant treatment also prevents TNF alpha-mediated fulminant liver failure without affecting liver regeneration.",

In the present study, HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells were treated with EGCG to examine its effects on pro-MMP-7 induction and production using RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Surprisingly, EGCG (10-100 mu M) treatment increased both intracellular and extracellular pro-MMP-7 protein levels (2.6-8.4-fold and 1.9-6.4-fold, respectively) in dose- and time-dependent manner, with a significant upregulation of its mRNA expression. EGCG also activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2, c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as previously reported. In addition, the polyphenol triggered the phosphorylation of c-JUN (Ser63 and Ser73) and induced c-JUN/c-FOS, thereby increasing the DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1), as shown by an AP-1 luciferase reporter assay. Pharmacological blockade of MAPK activities suggested that pro-MMP-7 expression was induced via JNK1/2 activation, but not in the case of ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine, superoxide (O-2(-)) dismutase and catalase attenuated the EGCG-induced pro-MMP-7 production, suggesting an involvement of oxidative stress in these events. Conversely, EGCG spontaneously generated O-2(-) in a cell-free system that utilized a cytochrome C reduction method. Further, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (25 and 100 mu M) and green tea polyphenols (33 and 132 mu g/ml) induced pro-MMP-7 expression, whereas (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin (100 mu M each) did not. Induction of pro-MMP-7 expression by EGCG was also shown in another human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. Our results suggest that some green tea catechins induce pro-MMP-7 production via O-2(-) production and the activation of JNK1/2, c-JUN, c-FOS and AP-1 in HT-29 cells.",

However, the mechanism has not been clarified yet. Methods: The changes of gene expression were investigated in rats given 250 mg/kg of sesamin (sesamin rats) or vehicle (control rats) for three days by using a DNA microarray analysis. At 4 hr after the final ingestion, the profiles of gene expression in rat livers were compared. Results: The analysis showed that 38 transcripts were up-regulated with a significant change of more than two-fold and eight transcripts were down-regulated with a significant change to less than half in the livers of sesamin rats versus control rats. The gene expression levels of the early stage enzymes of P-oxidation including long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase were not changed, however, those of the late stage enzymes of beta-oxidation including trifunctional enzyme in mitochondria, and acyl-CoA oxidase, bifunctional enzyme and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase in peroxisomes, were significantly increased by sesamin ingestion. Also, in sesamin rats, the gene expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase was increased about three-fold, whereas alcohol dehydrogenase, liver catalase and CYP2E1 were not changed. Changes in the gene expression of alcohol- and aldehyde-metabolizing enzymes observed in a DNA microarray were also confirmed by a real-time PCR method. Conclusions: These results suggested that sesamin ingestion regulated the transcription levels of hepatic metabolizing enzymes for alcohol and lipids.",

Antioxidants with polyphenol structures, such as those contained in green tea, given alone for 5 weeks in liquid Lieber de Carli diet followed by administration with ethanol for 4 weeks with ethanol have been investigated as potential therapeutic antioxidant agents in the brain in rats of three ages (2, 12, and 24 months). Ethanol consumption caused age-dependent decreases in brain superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities. In addition, ethanol consumption caused age-dependent decreases in the levels of GSH, selenium, vitamins, E, A and C, and P-carotene and increases in the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Changes in the brain's antioxidative ability were accompanied by enhanced oxidative modification of lipids (increases in lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal levels) and proteins (increases in carbonyl groups and bistyrosine). Reduced risk of oxidative stress and protection of the central nervous system, particularly in young and adult rats. after green tea supplementation were observed. Green tea partially prevented changes in antioxidant enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic parameters induced by ethanol and enhanced by aging. Administration of green tea significantly protects lipids and proteins against oxidative modifications in the brain tissue of young and adult rats. The beneficial effect of green tea can result from the inhibition of free radical chain reactions generated during ethanol-induced oxidative stress and/or from green tea-induced increases in antioxidative abilities made possible by increases in the activity/concentration of endogenous antioxidants.

		"abstract": "Sesamin, a major lignan in sesame seeds, has multiple functions such as cholesterol-lowering and anti-hypertensive activities. To investigate the effect of sesamin on gene expression in the liver, a DNA microarray analysis was carried out. The ingestion of sesamin dissolved in olive oil up-regulated the expression of 38 genes, 16 of which encode proteins possessing a lipid-metabolizing function, and 16 of which encode proteins possessing a xenobiotic/endogenous substance metabolizing function. In particular, sesamin significantly increased the expression of double down arrow-oxidation-associated enzymes in peroxisomes and auxiliary enzymes required for degradation, via the double down arrow-oxidation pathway, of unsaturated fatty acids in mitochondria. The ingestion of sesamin also resulted in an increase in the gene expression of acyl-CoA thioesterase involved in acyl-CoA hydrolase and very-long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase. Interestingly, it induced the expression of the gene for aidehyde dehydrogenase, an alcohol-metabolizing enzyme. These results suggest that sesamin regulates the metabolism of lipids, xenobiotics, and alcohol at the mRNA level.",

		"abstract": "1.Alcohol-induced hypertension is well recognized with clear evidence for a direct pressor effect of chronic alcohol consumption provided by a number of intervention studies in humans. In experimental animals, the effect of alcohol on blood pressure is less consistent; however, in Sprague-Dawley rats, alcohol feeding consistently induces a hypertensive response. The mechanism of alcohol-induced hypertension is not clearly understood. Ethanol is known to induce certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly the 2E1 isoform, which has been shown to metabolise arachidonic acid (AA) to the 19-hydroxy metabolite (19-HETE), which could have prohypertensive activity; CYP4A, by comparison, is the principal AA omega-hydroxylase in the liver. Polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, have been shown to inhibit some CYPs. 2.In this study, we determined the effect of alcohol administration on blood pressure and CYP-dependent AA metabolism in the rat and its possible modulation by red wine polyphenols. 3.Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to three groups, which received water, low-dose ethanol (5% v/v) or red wine (diluted to contain 5% ethanol) for a period of 9 weeks. Bodyweight and blood pressure were measured weekly and 24h urine collected at baseline and every 2 weeks. Animals were killed at 9 weeks and blood and tissue samples were collected. The blood pressure of rats fed with alcohol increased significantly over the period of the study compared with controls (P < 0.001). The blood pressure of animals fed 5% alcohol in the form of red wine was not significantly different from controls over the study period. The urinary excretion of 20-HETE did not differ significantly among the treatment groups over the study period and there was no effect of any treatment on the metabolism of AA by renal microsomes. Red wine, but not administration of the relatively low dose of alcohol alone, increased the expression of CYP2E1 protein in the liver and kidney and CYP4A in the kidney. Both red wine and alcohol decreased CYP4A protein levels in the liver compared with controls. 4.Our results suggest that constituents of red wine, possibly polyphenols, can attenuate the alcohol-induced rise in blood pressure in the Sprague-Dawley rat, although this effect does not appear to be mediated by the inhibition of CYP-derived AA metabolism.",

		"abstract": "The involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholic diseases in the liver has been repeatedly confirmed. Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin present in grape skin and red wine possesses a variety of biological activities including antioxidant. This study was conducted to evaluate whether resveratrol has a preventive effect on the main indicators of hepatic oxidative status as an expression of the cellular damage caused by free radicals, and on antioxidant defence mechanism during chronic ethanol treatment. Wistar rats were treated daily with 35% ethanol solution (3 g/kg/day i.p.) during 6 weeks and fed basal diet or basal diet containing 5 g/kg resveratrol. Control rats were treated with i.p. saline and fed basal diet. Experimentally, chronic ethanol administration leads to hepatotoxicity as monitored by the increase in the level of hepatic marker enzymes and the appearance of fatty change, necrosis, fibrosis and inflammation in liver sections. Ethanol also enhanced the formation of MDA in the liver indicating an increase in lipid peroxidation, a major end-point of oxidative damage, and caused drastic alterations in antioxidant defence systems. Particularly the activities of hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were found reduced by ethanol treatment while glutathione reductase (GR) activity was unchanged. Dietary supplementation with resveratrol during ethanol treatment inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation and ameliorated SOD, GPx and CAT activities in the liver. Conclusively, we can suggest that resveratrol could have a beneficial effect in inhibiting the oxidative damage induced by chronic ethanol administration, which was proved by the experiments that we conducted on rats.

		"abstract": "Endogenous factors, including hormones, growth factors and cytokines, play an important role in the regulation of hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme expression in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Diabetes, fasting, obesity, protein-calorie malnutrition and long-term alcohol consumption produce changes in hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme gene and protein expression. This difference in expression alters the metabolism of xenobiotics, including procarcinogens, carcinogens, toxicants and therapeutic agents, potentially impacting the efficacy and safety of therapeutic agents, and/or resulting in drug-drug interactions. Although the mechanisms by which xenobiotics regulate drug metabolizing enzymes have been studied intensively, less is known regarding the cellular signaling pathways and components which regulate drug metabolizing enzyme gene and protein expression in response to hormones and cytokines. Recent findings, however, have revealed that several cellular signaling pathways are involved in hormone- and growth factor-mediated regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes. Our laboratory has reported that insulin and growth factors regulate drug metabolizing enzyme gene and protein expression, including cytochromes P450 (CYP), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), through receptors which are members of the large receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, and by downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK), Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6 kinase). Here, we review current knowledge of the signaling pathways implicated in regulation of drug metabolizing enzyme gene and protein expression in response to insulin and growth factors, with the goal of increasing our understanding of how disease affects these signaling pathways, components, and ultimately gene expression and translational control.

OTA was reported to be nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, hepatotoxic and a potential carcinogen, with yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Consumption of contaminated wines might contribute up to 13% of OTA daily human intake. Potentially chronic exposure has therefore raised public health concern. OTA toxicity in the presence of de-alcoholated red wine was investigated in human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells, differentiated on filter supports, by measuring tight junction (TJ) permeability, morphological alterations of TJ proteins and occurrence of apoptosis. Cells were treated with OTA, in the presence of de-alcoholated red wine, for 48 It and the ability to recover from the effects of OTA was evaluated after 24 It in complete medium. OTA treatment increased TJ permeability and caused intracellular redistribution of claudin-4. However, cells were able to restore permeability and correct localization of claudin-4 following 24 h recovery. Conversely, in the presence of red wine, OTA produced faster and irreversible increase in TJ permeability, intracellular delocalization of claudin-4 and extensive apoptosis. Our results point at a possible synergy between OTA and some red wine components, such as polyphenols, in the induction of apoptotic cell death. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenolic compound found in green tea, is a promising chemopreventive agent against cancer due to its strong anti proliferative effects on cancer cells; however, its possible toxicity and carcinogenicity must be investigated before EGCG can be used as a dietary supplement for chemoprevention. The inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is strongly associated with carcinogenesis, particularly the tumor promotion process; thus, we investigated the effects of EGCG on GJ1C in WB-F344 normal rat liver epithelial (FILE) cells. EGCG, but not (-)-epicatechin (EC), another polyphenol found in green tea, inhibited GJIC in a dose-dependent and reversible manner in FILE cells. EGCG also induced the phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43), a major regulator of GJIC. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was also observed in EGCG-treated FILE cells. The inhibition of GJIC and phosphorylation of Cx43 and ERK1/2 by EGCG were completely blocked by U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase. EGCG generated a larger amount of hydrogen peroxide than EC in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, catalase partially inhibited the EGCG-induced inhibition of GJIC and the phosphorylation of Cx43 and ERK1/2. These results indicated that EGCG inhibited GJIC mainly due to its prooxidant activity.",

		"abstract": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate effects of quercetin, a major dietary flavonoid occurring in foods of plant origin, on cell viability and migration of osteoblastic cells. Quercetin inhibited cell viability, which was largely attributed to apoptosis, in a dose-and time-dependent manner in osteoblastic cells. Similar cytotoxicity of quercetin was observed in adipose tissue-derived stromal cells. Quercetin exerted a protective effect against H(2)O(2)-induced cell death, whereas it increased TNF-alpha-induced cell death. Western blot analysis showed that quercetin induced activation of ERK and p38, but not JNK. Quercetin-induced cell death was prevented by the ERK inhibitor PD98059, but not by inhibitors of p38 and JNK. Quercetin increased Bax expression and caused depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, which were inhibited by PD98059. Quercetin induced caspase-3 activation, and the quercetininduced cell death was prevented by caspase inhibitors. Quercetin inhibited cell migration, and its effect was prevented by inhibitors of ERK and p38. Taken together, these findings suggest that quercetin induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent mechanism involving ERK activation and inhibits migration through activation of ERK and p38 pathways. Quercetin may exert both protective and deleterious effects in bone repair.",

The animals were divided into five groups. The animals in groups I and V were normal control and mangiferin control, respectively.

At the end of the experiment period, the reactive oxygen species, glutathione and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were assessed in both lung and liver tissues. The levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, vitamin E and vitamin C were decreased in group II animals.

Here, we report the effects of long-term exposure to micromolar concentrations of RES on antioxidant and DNA repair enzyme activities in a human cell line (MRC-5). RES had either no effect on, or reduced the activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD), in treatments lasting up to 2 weeks. RES failed to induce activities of the DNA base excision repair enzymes apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease and DNA polymerase beta. However, it dramatically and progressively induced mitochondrial MnSOD expression and activity. Two weeks exposure to RES increased MnSOD protein level 6-fold and activity 14-fold. Thus, long-term exposure of human cells to RES results in a highly specific upregulation of MnSOD, and this may be an important mechanism by which it elicits its effects in human cells.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol and a major component of green tea, possess a potent antioxidant property. This study was designed to evaluate the potential antioxidative activity of EGCG in the plasma and lungs during bleomycin induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Intratracheal administration of bleomycin (6.5 U/kg body weight) to rats resulted in significant reduction of body weight, enzymic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E and vitamin A). Elevations in lung W/D (wet weight/dry weight) ratio, hydroxyproline content was observed with a synchronized increase in lipid peroxidation markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides). Intraperitoneal administration of EGCG at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight significantly improved the body weight, enzymic and non enzymic antioxidants and considerably decreased the W/D ratio, hydroxyproline and lipid peroxidation marker levels. Histological observations also correlated with the biochemical parameters. Thus, this study confirms the beneficial use of EGCG in alleviating the oxidative stress induced during pulmonary fibrosis.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol-induced liver injury is characterized by increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the development of hepatic steatosis, injury, and cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Thioredoxin (Trx), a potent antioxidant and and inflammatory molecule with antiapoptotic properties, protects animals from a number of inflammatory diseases. However, the effects of ethanol on Trx or its role in ethanol-induced liver injury are not known. Female C57BL/6 mice were allowed ad libitum access to a Lieber-deCarli ethanol diet with 5.4% of calories as ethanol for 2 days to acclimate them to the diet, followed by 2 days with 32.4% of calories as ethanol or pair-fed control diet. Hepatic Trx-1 was decreased by ethanol feeding; daily supplementation with recombinant human Trx (rhTrx) prevented this ethanol-induced decrease. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that administration of rhTrx during ethanol exposure would attenuate ethanol-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine production, and apoptosis. Mice were treated with a daily intraperitoneal injection of either 5 g/kg of rhTrx or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Conclusion: Ethanol feeding increased accumulation of hepatic 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts, expression of hepatic tumor necrosis factor a, and resulted in hepatic steatosis and increased plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. In ethanol-fed mice, treatment with rhTrx reduced 4-hydroxynonenal adduct accumulation, inflammatory cytokine expression, decreased hepatic triglyceride, and improved liver enzyme profiles. Ethanol feeding also increased transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling-positive cells, caspase-3 activity, and cytokeratin-18 staining in the liver. rhTrx treatment prevented these increases. In summary, rhTrx attenuated ethanol-induced increases in markers of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine expression, and apoptosis. (HEPATOLOGY 2009;49:1709-1717.)",

Chronic alcohol intake has been shown to result in alcoholic liver disease, although the precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to examine the impact of facilitated acetaldehyde metabolism via overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) on chronic alcohol ingestion-induced hepatic damage. Mice (wild-type Friend Virus B (FVB) and ALDH2 transgenic mice) were placed on a 4% alcohol or control diet for 12 weeks. Pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, including p53, Omi/HtrA2, Bcl-2, Bax, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Akt, phosphorylated (p) Akt, the Akt downstream signalling molecule Pim and pPim, were examined using immunoblot analysis. Apoptosis and protein damage were assessed using the caspase 3 assay and protein carbonyl formation, respectively. The data revealed that alcohol intake enhanced expression of p53, Omi/HtrA2, Bcl-2 and Bax without affecting XIAP expression or the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Total Akt and pPim were downregulated in response to alcohol, whereas total Pim was upregulated in conjunction with unchanged pAkt. As a result, the pAkt : Akt and pPim : Pim ratios were elevated and reduced, respectively, in response to alcohol. All these effects that resulted from alcohol exposure were attenuated or ablated by ALDH2. Collectively, the results suggest that ALDH2 may effectively ameliorate alcohol-induced hepatic apoptosis and changes in Akt as well as Pim signalling.",

In this study, we investigated the association of hepatic antioxidant enzymes and cecal condition, including intestinal bacteria estimated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), in the early stage of alcoholic fatty liver. Three liquid isocaloric diets, control (CT) diet, ethanol (ET) diet, or ethanol diet including modified beet fiber (MBF), were prepared and administered to rats for 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the ET group were higher and that in MBF groups tended to be higher than the CT group, but endotoxin was not detected in the portal vein in any of the samples. The hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration in the MBF group was higher than that in the CT group. Hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) was induced in ethanol-fed rats. The hepatic catalase levels in the ET and MBF groups were lower than that in the CT group. The hepatic superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) level did not differ among the groups. Plasma ALT level and/or hepatic TBARS level correlated positively with CYP2E1 and negatively with catalase level and SOD-2 level. Indicators of cecal condition, including the bacterial population estimated by T-RFLP, may not give any explanation for the hepatic damage. In conclusion, the hepatic CYP2EI induced by ethanol, rather than the cecal conditions, may influence the early stage of alcoholic hepatic damage in rats; hepatic catalase may provide protective effects.",

The results showed that HPE reduced 94.6% of xanthine oxidase activity in vitro, and decreased nitrite and PGE2 secretions in LPS-induced cells. In LPS-treated rats, HPE significantly decreased the serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. In the liver, lipid peroxidation and liver lesions decreased, and catalase activity and glutathione increased. The study also revealed that down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and p-P38 might have been involved.

		"abstract": "Cinnamon is used to flavor most foods in Arabian countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the medicinal importance, reflecting an important trend in research. The hepatoprotective activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of cinnamon was investigated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) induced lipid peroxidation and hepatic injury in rats. The elevated serum AST and ALT enzymatic activities induced by CCl(4) were significantly restored to near normal by oral administration of 200 mg/kg of either extracts once daily for 7 days, as compared to untreated rats. There was a significant elevation in the level of liver malondialdhyde (MDA), while the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase (SOD and CAT) were significantly decreased in CCl(4) intoxicated rats. The results obtained indicated that ethanolic extract has more potent hepatoprotective action than water extract against CCl(4) by lowering the MDA level and elevating antioxidants enzymes activities (SOD and CAT). The possible mechanism of this activity may be free radical-scavenging polyphenol compounds. The hepatoprotective properties were documented by the histopathological data obtained. Consequently, this extract can be used as a therapeutic regime in treatment of some hepatic disorders without any side effects. Further study will be done for separation and identification of active components and for testing antitumor activity.",

The protective role of HO-1 and its generated products (CO, bilirubin, and Fe) in ethanol-induced human hepatocyte damage. Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 296: G1318-G1323, 2009. First published March 26, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00555.2007.-It has been reported that naturally occurring quercetin exerts hepatoprotective effects through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. However, the precise mechanism of how ethanol-associated liver damage is counteracted by quercetin-enhanced HO-1 metabolism still remains unclear. To further decipher the protective role of quercetin on ethanol-induced liver damage, we treated human hepatocytes with quercetin and various (end) products of the HO-1 pathway. Our data clearly showed that quercetin treatment attenuated ethanol-induced damage, whereas hemoglobin and zinc protoporphyrin 9 (ZnPP) abolished such effects. Iron-II aggravated ethanol toxicity and was only partially reduced by quercetin. In contrast, carbon monoxide (CO) dose dependently inhibited ethanol-induced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) activity and hepatotoxicity but had no influence on CYP 2E1 protein expression. Similarly, hemoglobin dramatically stimulated CYP 2E1 activity but not the protein expression in quercetin-and ethanol-cotreated hepatocytes. ZnPP significantly promoted CYP 2E1 protein expression in the presence and absence of CO treatment but inhibited ethanol-induced CYP 2E1 activation following CO incubation in quercetin-and ethanol-cotreated hepatocytes. These results suggested that quercetin virtually attenuated ethanol-derived oxidative damage via HO-1 induction. Heme degradation and CO release may mediate the protective effects through inhibiting ethanol-induced CYP 2E1 synthesis and enzymatic activity, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol induces hepatic steatosis via a complex mechanism that is not well understood. Among the variety of molecules that have been proposed to participate in this mechanism, the sterol regulatory element (SRE)binding proteins (SREBPs) have been identified as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of honokiol on alcoholic steatosis and investigated its possible effect on the inhibition of SREBP-1c maturation. In in vitro studies, H4IIEC3 rat hepatoma cells developed increased lipid droplets when exposed to ethanol. but co-treatment with honokiol reversed this effect. Honokiol inhibited the maturation of SREBP-1c and its translocation to the nucleus, the binding of nSREBP-1c to SIZE or SRE-related sequences of its lipogenic target genes, and the expression of genes for fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, magnolol. a structural isomer of honokiol. had no effect on nSREBP-1c levels. Male Wistar rats fed with a standard Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet for 4 weeks exhibited increased hepatic triglyceride and decreased hepatic glutathione levels, with concomitantly increased serum alanine aminotransferase and TNF-alpha levels. Daily administration of honokiol (10 mg/kg body weight) by gavage during the final 2 weeks of ethanol treatment completely reversed these effects on hepatotoxicity markers, including hepatic triglyceride, hepatic glutathione, and serum TNF-alpha, with efficacious abrogation of fat accumulation in the liver. Inhibition of SREBP-1c protein maturation and of the expression of Srebf1c and its target genes for hepatic lipogenesis were also observed in vivo. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated inhibition of specific binding of SREBP-l c to the Fas promoter by honokiol in vivo. These results demonstrate that honokiol has the potential to ameliorate alcoholic steatosis by blocking fatty acid synthesis regulated by SREBP-1c. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Both the chlorogenic acids and the flavan-3-ols are absorbed in the small intestine and appear in the circulatory system predominantly as glucuronide, sulfate and methylated metabolites. Even when absorption occurs in the small intestine, feeding studies with ileostomists reveal that substantial amounts of the parent compounds and some of their metabolites appear in ileal fluid indicating that in volunteers with a functioning colon these compounds will pass to the large intestine where they are subjected to the action of the colonic microflora. A diversity of colonic-derived catabolites are absorbed into the bloodstream and pass through the body prior to excretion in urine. There is growing evidence that these compounds, which were little investigated until recently, are produced in quantity in the colon and form a key part of the bioavailability equation of flavonoids and related compounds that occur in fruits, vegetables and beverages. Recent evidence indicates that some colon-derived phenolic acids have in vitro anti-inflammatory activity.",

		"abstract": "Aflatoxin B-1 is a potent hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic mycotoxin. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage are the principal manifestations of aflatoxin B-1-induced toxicity that could be counteracted by antioxidants. Many plant constituents have been reported to prevent liver damage associated with lipid peroxidation. In this study, curcumin (polyphenolic antioxidant purified from turmeric) and resveratrol (polyphenol obtained from grapes) were evaluated for possible protection against liver injury induced by aflatoxin B-1 in rats. Adult male Fischer rats were divided into six groups including untreated control, curcumin control (200 mg/kg BW), resveratrol control (10 mg/kg BW) and aflatoxin B-1 (25 mu g/kg BW). Other two groups were administered either curcumin or resveratrol along with aflatoxin B-1. The study was carried out for 90 days. At the end of the experiment period, blood and tissue samples were collected from the animals before they were killed. Livers were collected for histopathologic studies and fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution. Serum was used for estimation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) enzymes. The lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were estimated in liver homogenates. The results revealed that aflatoxin B-1 administration caused liver damage as indicated by statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in serum ALT, AST and gamma-GT levels. In addition, there were general statistically significant reductions in the activities of GSH, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and an increase in lipid peroxidation in the liver of aflatoxin B-1-treated group compared to the untreated control group. Curcumin showed a significant hepatoprotective activity by lowering the levels of serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and elevating the levels of GSH, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. However, resveratrol failed to protect from the aflatoxin B-1-induced liver injury. These findings suggest that curcumin but not resveratrol has a hepatoprotective effect against aflatoxin B-1-induced liver injury.",

Furthermore, we estimated the intracellular signaling pathway for the induction of SOD-2 mRNA expression. HepG2 cells were stimulated using extracts of four crops, including SQ, for 12 h; only extracts of colored potatoes induced SOD-2 mRNA expression significantly. This induction of SOD-2 mRNA expression was blocked by an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway.

		"abstract": "We and others have reported that Rho-kinase plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Studies have also demonstrated that the activation of Rho-kinase is reversed in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, the mechanisms by which Rho-kinase is increased in I/R and reversed in IPC are not thoroughly understood. In female Wistar rats, we created I/R by ligating the left anterior-descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) for 30 min and releasing the ligature for 180 min. IPC rats underwent IPC (two cycles of 5-min ligation of the LAD and 5-min reflow) before I/R. IPC caused a significant increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)(1/2) activity and reduced Rho-kinase activity and cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P < 0.05 versus I/R). Administration of PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, Caspase-3 activity and myocardial infarction size (P < 0.05 versus IPC). Western-blot analysis showed that administration of PD98059 increased Rho-kinase activity. Treatment with fasudil, an inhibitor of Rho-kinase, reversed cell apoptosis caused by treatment with PD98059 in IPC. In addition, ROCK1 (Rho-kinase 1) may be the major Rho-kinase isoform that is opposed by ERK-MAPK signaling in IPC. These results indicate that ERK-MAPK signaling is required in IPC to oppose Rho-kinase activity in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo.

		"abstract": "Cocoa, a good source of dietary antioxidative polyphenols, exhibited anticarcinogenic activity in animal models, but the molecular mechanisms of the chemopreventive potential of cocoa remain unclear. Inhibition of gap-junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is strongly related to tumorigenesis. Cocoa polyphenol extracts (CPE) dose dependently attenuated hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced inhibition of GJIC in rat liver epithelial (RLE) cells. CPE inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation and internalization of connexin 43, which is a regulating protein of GJIC in RLE cells. The H(2)O(2)-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase were inhibited by CPE treatment. However, CPE did not block H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. An ex vivo kinase assay demonstrated that CPE inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1 activity in RLE cell lysates. Ex vivo pull-down assay data revealed that CPE directly bound with MEK1 to inhibit MEK1 activity. These results indicate that CPE protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced inhibition of GJIC through antioxidant activity and direct inhibition of MEK activity, which may contribute to its chemopreventive potential.

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease is mediated via activation of TLR4 signaling; MyD88-dependent and -independent signals are important contributors to injury in mouse models. Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, suppresses TLR4/MyD88-dependent responses via induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Here we investigated the interactions between chronic ethanol, adiponectin, and HO-1 in regulation of TLR4/MyD88-independent signaling in macrophages and an in vivo mouse model. After chronic ethanol feeding, LPS-stimulated expression of IFN-beta and CXCL10 mRNA was increased in primary cultures of Kupffer cells compared with pair-fed control mice. Treatment of Kupffer cells with globular adiponectin (gAcrp) normalized this response. LPS-stimulated IFN-beta/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein was also reduced in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with gAcrp or full-length adiponectin. gAcrp and full-length adiponectin acted via adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. gAcrp decreased TLR4 expression in both Kupffer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Small interfering RNA knockdown of HO-1 or inhibition of HO-1 activity with zinc protoporphyrin blocked these effects of gAcrp. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic ethanol feeding, with or without treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin, to induce HO-1. After chronic ethanol feeding, mice were sensitized to in vivo challenge with LPS, expressing increased IFN-beta/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein in liver compared with control mice. Pretreatment with cobalt protoporphyrin 24 h before LPS challenge normalized this effect of ethanol. Adiponectin and induction of HO-1 potently suppressed TLR4-dependent/MyD88-independent cytokine expression in primary Kupffer cells from rats and in mouse liver after chronic ethanol exposure. These data suggest that induction of HO-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy in alcoholic liver disease. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 4928-4937.",

		"abstract": "Blueberries or bilberries contain large amounts of anthocyanins, making them one of the richest sources of dietary anthocyanin. These berries are widely consumed as fresh and dried fruits, jams, or juices. Considerable attention has been focused on the health benefits of bilberry fruits beyond their antioxidant content or their ability to improve vision. In this study, we tested the effect of dietary bilberry extract (BBE) on hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic mice. We found that dietary BBE ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Dietary BBE significantly reduced the blood glucose concentration and enhanced insulin sensitivity. AMPK was activated in white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, and the liver of diabetic mice fed BBE. This activation was accompanied by upregulation of glucose transporter 4 in WAT and skeletal muscle and suppression of glucose production and lipid content in the liver. At the same time, acetyl-CoA carboxylase was inactivated and PPAR alpha, acyl-CoA oxidase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A were upregulated in the liver. These changes resulted in improved hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. These findings provide a biochemical basis for the use of bilberry fruits and have important implications for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes via activation of AMPK. J.

Strawberries are common and important fruit due to their high content of essential nutrient and beneficial phytochemicals which seem to have relevant biological activity on human health. In the present study we investigated the antioxidant and protective effects of three strawberry extracts against ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage in an experimental in vivo model and to test whether strawberry extracts affect antioxidant enzyme activities in gastric mucosa. Methods/Principal Findings: Strawberry extracts were obtained from Adria, Sveva and Alba cultivars. Total antioxidant capacity and radical scavenging capacity were performed by TEAC, ORAC and electron paramagnetic resonance assays. Identification and quantification of anthocyanins was carried out by HPLC-DAD-MS analyses. Different groups of animals received 40 mg/day/kg body weight of strawberry crude extracts for 10 days. Gastric damage was induced by ethanol. The ulcer index was calculated together with the determination of catalase and SOD activities and MDA contents. Strawberry extracts are rich in anthocyanins and present important antioxidant capacity. Ethanol caused severe gastric damage and strawberry consumption protected against its deleterious role. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased significantly after strawberry extract intake and a concomitantly decrease in gastric lipid peroxidation was found. A significant correlation between total anthocyanin content and percent of inhibition of ulcer index was also found. Conclusions: Strawberry extracts prevented exogenous ethanol-induced damage to rats' gastric mucosa. These effects seem to be associated with the antioxidant activity and phenolic content in the extract as well as with the capacity of promoting the action of antioxidant enzymes. A diet rich in strawberries might exert a beneficial effect in the prevention of gastric diseases related to generation of reactive oxygen species.",

First published April 8, 2011; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00934.2010.-Ischemic preconditioning is a complex cardioprotective phenomenon that involves adaptive changes in cells and molecules and occurs in a biphasic pattern: an early phase after 1-2 h and a late phase after 12-24 h. While it is widely accepted that reactive oxygen species are strongly involved in triggering ischemic preconditiong, it is not clear if they play a major role in the early or late phase of preconditioning and which are the mechanisms involved. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms behind H2O2-induced cardioprotection in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We focused on antioxidant and phase II enzymes and their modulation by protein kinase signaling pathways and nuclearfactor- E-2-related factor-1 (Nrf1) and Nrf2. H2O2 preconditioning was able to counteract oxidative stress more effectively in the late than in the early phase of adaptation. In particular, H2O2 preconditioning counteracted oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 activity, increasing Bcl2 expression and selectively increasing the expression and activity of antioxidant and phase II enzymes through Nrf1 and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. The downregulation of Nrf1 and Nrf2 by small interfering RNA reduced the expression level of phase II enzymes. Specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and p38 MAPK activation partially reduced the cardioprotection elicited by H2O2 preconditioning and the induction and activity of phase II enzymes. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, a key role for Nrf1, and not only for Nrf2, in the induction of phase II enzymes triggered by H2O2 preconditioning.",

		"abstract": "Induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-mediated gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory mediators. The present study was carried out to investigate the role of catechin as a chain breaking inhibitor against experimental alcoholic liver injury. Rats were administered 35% v/v ethanol orally at a dose of 10 g/Kg/day for two weeks, followed by 14 g/Kg/day for 10 weeks. Catechin (50 mg/Kg) was co-supplemented after 4 weeks of alcohol treatment till the end of the dosing period. Following chronic alcohol exposure, rats developed endotoxemia and severe pathological changes in the liver such as pronounced fatty change, vacuolar degeneration and inflammation. These changes were accompanied by activation of NF-kappa B and induction of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators leading to increased level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, enhanced formation of malondialdehyde in the liver followed by drastic alterations in the hepatic antioxidant defense systems. Additionally, nitrite levels and lactate dehydrogenase activities were also significantly elevated on chronic alcohol consumption. Alcohol exposure also increased the number of micronucleated cells indicating that alcohol abuse may again be associated with the nuclear changes. Supplementation with catechin ameliorated the alcohol-induced liver injury by downregulating the endotoxin-mediated activation of initial signalling molecule NF-kappa B and further going downstream the signalling cascade including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and by enhancing the antioxidant profile. These observations correlated well with the histological findings. Moreover, a remarkable decrease in the percentage of micronucleated cells was observed with catechin supplementation indicating an apparent protection against alcohol-induced toxicity. These findings suggest that catechin may alleviate experimental alcoholic liver disease by suppressing induction of NF-kappa B, a key component of signalling pathway, thus forming a pharmacological basis for designing novel therapeutic agents against alcohol induced endotoxin-mediated liver injury.",

Search strategy We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to January 2011. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials. Selection criteria We considered for inclusion randomised trials that compared antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, vitamin A, C, E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention for autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis (any aetiology). Data collection and analysis Four authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, biochemical indices at maximum follow-up in the individual trials as well as adverse events, quality-of-life measures, and cost-effectiveness. For patients with hepatitis B or C we also considered end of treatment and sustained virological response. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Twenty randomised trials with 1225 participants were included. The trials assessed beta-carotene (3 trials), vitamin A (2 trials), vitamin C (9 trials), vitamin E (15 trials), and selenium (8 trials). The majority of the trials had high risk of bias and showed heterogeneity. Overall, the assessed antioxidant supplements had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.19, I-2 = 0%), or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95%",

		"abstract": "AIM: To investigate the antioxidative status of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in southeastern Taiwan. METHODS: Our study comprised 27 patients with ALD recruited from Taitung Mackay Memorial Hospital, located in southeastern Taiwan. Patients with ALD included 12 non-aborigines (12 men) and 15 aborigines (11 men and 4 women). According to the severity of ALD, patients with ALD included 10 with hepatitis (9 men and 1 woman) and 17 with cirrhosis (14 men and 3 women). Twenty-two age- and gender-matched healthy adults served as the control group in this study. Venous blood (10 mL) of each subject was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes after 8 h overnight fasting. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, patients with ALD showed significantly lower erythrocytic catalase (11.1 +/- 0.7 U/mg Hb vs 8.0 +/- 0.7 U/mg Hb, P < 0.05) and superoxide dismutase (9.5 +/- 1.6 U/mg Hb vs 3.0 +/- 0.2 U/mg Hb, P < 0.05) activities. Furthermore, the erythrocytic reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio was significantly lower in ALD patients than that in the control group (38.1 +/- 5.4 vs 15.7 +/- 1.9, P < 0.05). The results revealed that patients with ALD experienced more oxidative stress than those in the control group. The non-aboriginal, but not the aboriginal, ALD group had higher erythrocytic glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity than that in the control group (46.1 +/- 7.8 U/g Hb vs 27.9 +/- 2.2 U/g Hb, P < 0.05). Hepatitis, but not cirrhosis, ALD patients had higher erythrocytic GPX activity than that in the control group (44.3 +/- 8.6 U/g Hb vs 27.9 2.2 U/g Hb, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both ethnicity and the severity of ALD may cause different erythrocytic antioxidative enzyme activities especially GPX activity. (C) 2011 Baishideng.

		"abstract": "The development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex process involving both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells resident in the liver. Although the mechanisms for ALD are not completely understood, it is clear that increased oxidative stress, and activation of the innate immune system are essential elements in the pathophysiology of ALD. Oxidative stress from ethanol exposure results from increased generation of reactive oxygen species and decreased hepatocellular antioxidant activity, including changes in the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin family of proteins. Both cellular and circulating components of the innate immune system are activated by exposure to ethanol. For example, ethanol exposure enhances toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)-dependent cytokine expression by Kupffer cells, likely due, at least in part, to dysregulation of redox signaling. Similarly, complement activation in response to ethanol leads to increased production of the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, and activation C3a receptor and C5a receptor. Complement activation thus contributes to increased inflammatory cytokine production and can influence redox signaling. Here we will review recent progress in understanding the interactions between oxidative stress and innate immunity in ALD. These data illustrate that ethanol-induced oxidative stress and activation of the innate immune system interact dynamically during ethanol exposure, exacerbating ethanol-induced liver injury.

Plasma total cholesterol (T-Chol) levels were lower in rats fed a PP-supplemented diet for four weeks than in those fed a control diet. Cecal pH was lowered due to an increase in the levels of cecal total short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, in the PP group compared to the control group. Furthermore, animals fed with the PP-supplemented diet showed increased cecal ratios of Lactobacillus and Clostridia and decreased cecal ratios of Bacteroides and Gammaproteobacteria with slightly negative and positive correlations with plasma T-Chol levels, respectively. In conclusion, ingestion of PP for four weeks is likely to improve both cecal conditions and cholesterol metabolism, suggesting that PP has prebiotic effects.",

		"abstract": "Activation of Nrf2 by covalent modifications that release it from its inhibitor protein Keap1 has been extensively documented. In contrast, covalent modifications that may regulate its action after its release from Keap1 have received little attention. Here we show that CREB-binding protein induced acetylation of Nrf2, increased binding of Nrf2 to its cognate response element in a target gene promoter, and increased Nrf2-dependent transcription from target gene promoters. Heterologous sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) decreased acetylation of Nrf2 as well as Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, and its effects were overridden by dominant negative SIRT1 (SIRT1-H355A). The SIRT1-selective inhibitors EX-527 and nicotinamide stimulated Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, whereas resveratrol, a putative activator of SIRT1, was inhibitory, mimicking the effect of SIRT1. Mutating lysine to alanine or to arginine at Lys(588) and Lys(591) of Nrf2 resulted in decreased Nrf2-dependent gene transcription and abrogated the transcription-activating effect of CREB-binding protein. Furthermore, SIRT1 had no effect on transcription induced by these mutants, indicating that these sites are acetylation sites. Microscope imaging of GFP-Nrf2 in HepG2 cells as well as immunoblotting for Nrf2 showed that acetylation conditions resulted in increased nuclear localization of Nrf2, whereas deacetylation conditions enhanced its cytoplasmic rather than its nuclear localization. We posit that Nrf2 in the nucleus undergoes acetylation, resulting in binding, with basic-region leucine zipper protein(s), to the antioxidant response element and consequently in gene transcription, whereas deacetylation disengages it from the antioxidant response element, thereby resulting in transcriptional termination and subsequently in its nuclear export.",

		"abstract": "Glucuronidation mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) is a significant metabolic pathway that facilitates efficient elimination of numerous endobiotics and xenobiotics, including phenolics. UGT genetic deficiency and polymorphisms or inhibition of glucuronidation by concomitant use of drugs are associated with inherited physiological disorders or drug-induced toxicities. Moreover, extensive glucuronidation can be a barrier to oral bioavailability as the first-pass glucuronidation (or premature clearance by UGTs) of orally administered agents usually results in the poor oral bioavailability and lack of efficacies. This review focused on the first-pass glucuronidation of phenolics including natural polyphenols and pharmaceuticals. The complexity of UGT-mediated metabolism of phenolics is highlighted with species-, gender-, organ-and isoform-dependent specificity, as well as functional compensation between UGT1A and 2B subfamily. In addition, recent advances are discussed with respect to the mechanisms of enzymatic actions, including the important properties such as binding pocket size and phosphorylation requirements.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Here, hepatic L02 cells exposed to H2O2 (100 mu M) were used to demonstrate that hyperoside protected cells by significantly inhibiting overproduction of intracellular ROS, depletion of the mitochondrial membrane potential and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase. Hyperoside further enhanced the cellular antioxidant defense system through increasing the activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and by up-regulating HO-1 expression. Meanwhile, real time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence studies revealed that hyperoside stimulated nuclear translocation of the Nrf(2) transcription factor in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was significantly suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 and ERK. Collectively, our data provide the first description of the mechanism underlying hyperoside's ability to attenuate H2O2-induced cell damage, namely this compound interacts with the MAPK-dependent Keap(1)-Nrf(2)-ARE signaling pathway to up-regulate HO-1 expression and enhance intracellular antioxidant activity.

However, CYP2E1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of high-fat mediated non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Thus, the role of CYP2E1 in high-fat mediated NASH development was evaluated. Methods: Male wild type (WT) and Cyp2el-null mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD, 10% energy-derived) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% energy-derived) for 10 weeks. Liver histology and tissue homogenates were examined for various parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation. Results: Liver histology showed that only WT mice fed a HFD developed NASH despite the presence of increased steatosis in both WT and Cyp2el-null mice fed HFD. Markers of oxidative stress such as elevated CYP2E1 activity and protein amounts, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, nitration, and glycation with increased phospho-JNK were all markedly elevated only in the livers of HFD-fed WT mice. Furthermore, while the levels of inflammation markers osteopontin and F4/80 were higher in HFD-fed WT mice, TNF alpha and MCP-1 levels were lower compared to the corresponding LFD-fed WT. Finally, only HFD-fed WT mice exhibited increased insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Conclusions: These data suggest that CYP2E1 is critically important in NASH development by promoting oxidative/nitrosative stress, protein modifications, inflammation, and insulin resistance.

		"abstract": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major active polyphenol of green tea, has been shown to down-regulate inflammatory responses in dendritic cells (DCs); however, the underlying mechanism has not been understood. Recently, we identified the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) as a cell-surface EGCG receptor. In this study, we showed the molecular basis for the down-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signal transduction by EGCG in DCs. The expressions of CD80, CD86, and MHC class I and II, which are molecules essential for antigen presentation by DCs, were inhibited by EGCG via 67LR. In addition, EGCG-treated DCs inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1 beta, and IL-6) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 translocation through 67LR. Interestingly, we also found that EGCG markedly elevated the expression of the Tollip protein, a negative regulator of TLR signaling, through 67LR. These novel findings provide new insight into the understanding of negative regulatory mechanisms of the TLR4 signaling pathway and consequent inflammatory responses that are implicated in the development and progression of many chronic diseases.

The research on this chemical started through the \"French paradox,\" which describes improved cardiovascular outcomes despite a high-fat diet in French people. Since then, resveratrol has been broadly studied and shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-angiogenic effects, with those on oxidative stress possibly being most important and underlying some of the others, but many signaling pathways are among the molecular targets of resveratrol. In concert they may be beneficial in many disorders, particularly in diseases where oxidative stress plays an important role.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), mainly butyrate, are claimed to improve mucosal integrity, reduce intestinal permeability and act as anti-inflammatory agents for the colon mucosa. We evaluated the effects of oral administration of SCFA or butyrate in the 5FU-induced mucositis. Mice received water, SCFA or butyrate during all experiment (10 days) and a single dose of 5FU (200 mg/kg) 3 days before euthanasia. We evaluated inflammatory and histological score by morphometry, and by activity of enzymes specific to neutrophil, eosinophil and macrophage and TLR-4, TNF-alpha and IL6 expressions. Intestinal permeability and tight junction protein ZO-1 expression were evaluated. Mice from the 5FU (5-Fluorouracil) group presented weight loss, ulcerations and inflammatory infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils, increased expression of IL6 and TNF-alpha and increased intestinal permeability. SCFA minimized intestinal damage, reduced ulcerations without affecting intestinal permeability. Butyrate alone was more efficient at improving those parameters than in SCFA solution and also reduced intestinal permeability. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ZO-1 tended to be higher in the SCFA supplemented but not in the butyrate supplemented group. We showed the beneficial effects of butyrate on intestinal mucositis and its promising function as an adjuvant in the treatment of diseases not only of the colon, but also of the small intestine.",

		"abstract": "Aims: To investigate neuroprotective effects of three major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, and petunidin-3-O-glucoside) isolated from the black soybean (Glycine max L) cv. Cheongja 3 seed coat against H2O2-induced cell death of human brain neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Main methods: Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, production and expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and inactivation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades were determined by MTT assay, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. Key findings: Pretreatment with anthocyanins reduced the cytotoxicity of H2O2 on SK-N-SH cells, dose-dependently reduced the intracellular ROS level and inactivated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1, Thr845), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins. The HO-1 and Neu1 mRNA levels were increased by H2O2 (25 mu M) and further elevated by the pretreatment with anthocyanins. Sialic acids added to the culture plates not only attenuated the cytotoxicity of H2O2 (25 mu M) but also reduced intracellular ROS level. These results suggest that Cheongja 3 black soybean seed coat anthocyanins have brain neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress (H2O2) by inhibiting the activation of ASK1-JNK/p38 pathways, scavenging ROS, stimulating the expression of HO-1 and, more interestingly, recruiting cellular free sialic acids through up-regulation of Neu1 sialidase gene expression. Significance: This is the first report indicating potent health benefits of black soybean seed coat anthocyanins in neuroprotection by triggering mobilization of cellular free sialic acid and utilizing it as an additional biological antioxidant in brain neural cells.

		"abstract": "Oxidative stress is the major contributor to acetaminophen (AAP)-caused liver damage. It promotes mitochondrial oxidative stress and collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential to cause cell death. We have previously shown that a polyphenol extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HPE) potentiated the antioxidative effect. We further examined in this study the possible mechanism of HPE against AAP-caused liver damage. BABL/c mice were orally fed with HPE (100, 200 or 300 mg/kg) for two weeks prior to an i.p. injection of 1000 mg/kg of AAP. The mice were decapitated 6 h after the AAP injection to collect the blood and liver for further determination. The results show that pretreating with HPE increased the level of glutathione (GSH), decreased the level of lipid peroxidation, and increased catalase activity in the liver. A histopathological evaluation shows that HPE could decrease AAP-induced liver sterosis accompanied by a decreased expression of AIF, Bax, Bid, and p-JNK in the liver. An in vitro assay revealed that HPE could reduce AAP-induced death of BABL/c normal liver cells (BNLs), reverse the lost mitochondrial potency and improve the antioxidative status, similarly to the results of the in vivo assay. 'We show in this study that HPE possessed the ability to protect the liver from AAP-caused injury. The protective mechanism might be regulated by decreasing oxidative stress and attenuating the mitochondrial dysfunction.",

		"abstract": "Background: (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol component of green tea that has antioxidant activities. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces inflammatory cytokine production and impairs blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. We examined the effect of EGCG on LPS-induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) and BBB permeability. Methods: The expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) in hCMECs were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Monocytes that adhered to LPS-stimulated endothelial cells were measured by monocyte adhesion assay. Tight junctional factors were detected by qRT-PCR (Claudin 5 and Occludin) and immunofluorescence staining (Claudin 5 and ZO-1). The permeability of the hCMEC monolayer was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry of transmembrane fluorescin and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). NF-kappa B activation was measured by luciferase assay. Results: EGCG significantly suppressed the LPS-induced expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in hCMECs. EGCG also inhibited the expression of MCP-1/CCL2, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Functional analysis showed that EGCG induced the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin-5) in hCMECs. Investigation of the mechanism showed that EGCG had the ability to inhibit LPS-mediated NF-kappa B activation. In addition, 67-kD laminin receptor was involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of EGCG. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that LPS induced inflammatory cytokine production in hCMECs, which could be attenuated by EGCG. These data indicate that EGCG has a therapeutic potential for endotoxin-mediated endothelial inflammation.",

		"abstract": "Recent studies from our laboratory have showed that resveratrol, a polyphenol found predominantly in grapes rendered strong cardioprotection in animal models of heart disease. The cardioprotection which was observed was primarily associated with the ability of resveratrol to reduce oxidative stress in these models. The aim of the current study was to corroborate the role of resveratrol as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and explore the underlying mechanisms of its action in heart disease. For this purpose, we used a cell model of oxidative stress, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposed adult rat cardiomyocytes, which was treated with and without resveratrol (30 mu M); cardiomyocytes which were not exposed to resveratrol served as controls. Cell injury, cell death and oxidative stress measurements as well as the activities of the major endogenous antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were carried out in control and H2O2 exposed cardiomyocytes, treated with and without resveratrol. Pharmacological blockade using specific blockers of the antioxidant enzymes were used to confirm their role in mediating resveratrol action in H2O2 exposed cardiomyocytes. The status of H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes in serum samples from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with and without resveratrol (2.5 mg/kg body weight) was also examined. Our results showed significant cell injury and death in H2O2 exposed cardiomyocytes which was prevented upon resveratrol treatment. SOD and CAT activities were decreased in H2O2 exposed adult rat cardiomyocytes; treatment with resveratrol significantly prevented this reduction. However, GPx activity was not altered in the H2O2 exposed cardiomyocytes in comparison to controls. Pharmacological blockade of SOD and/or CAT prevented the beneficial effect of resveratrol. In SHR, H2O2 levels were increased, but CAT activity was decreased, while SOD remained unchanged, when compared to WKY rats; resveratrol treatment significantly prevented the increase in H2O2 levels and the decrease in CAT activities in SHR. Based on our results, we conclude that treatment with resveratrol prevents oxidative stress induced cardiomyocyte injury mainly by preserving the activities of critical antioxidant enzymes. This may be a crucial mechanism by which resveratrol confers cardioprotection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether alcohol-free wine has any effect on antioxidant enzymes. The study was a randomized cross-over human intervention. A low phenolic diet (LPD) was designed to prevent interference from polyphenols in other food sources. In the first period, the volunteers ate only this low phenolic diet; in the second, they ate this diet and also drank 300 mL of alcohol-free wine. The enzymes under study were: superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. The activities of glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased during the LPD period and increased in the LPD + dealcoholized wine period. On the third day of intervention, significant changes were observed in glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase activity for both intervention periods under study. Catalase activity changed significantly on the seventh day of intervention. Antioxidant enzymes modulated their activity more easily than the endogenous antioxidants, which did not undergo any changes. Our results show for the first time that the increase in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes is not due to the alcohol content in wine but to the polyphenolic composition. Therefore, alcohol-free wine could be an excellent source of antioxidants to protect people suffering from oxidative stress (cancer, diabetes, alzheimer, etc.) who should not consume alcohol.

		"abstract": "The benefits of moderate amounts of alcohol for a better health and longer life expectancy compared with abstinence have been suggested by the findings of numerous studies. However, controversies have emerged regarding the influence of confounding factors and the systematic errors that might have been inadvertently disregarded in the early studies. This review includes a description of the findings of those research studies published in the last 5 years on the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality, CVD and inflammation, the immune system, insulin sensitivity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cancer. Promising evidences exist from both animal studies and human clinical trials regarding intermediate end-points of CHD and insulin sensitivity, such as HDL, adiponectin or fibrinogen. However, controversies and inconsistent findings exist regarding many of these diseases and related functions and biomarkers. Further research and human randomised-controlled trials with adequate standardisation of the study conditions are necessary in order to draw a comparison between studies, establish the causal effect of moderate alcohol intake on disease protection and reach consensus on the circumstances that allow the recommendation of moderate alcohol habitual intakes as a strategy for health maintenance.",

		"abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, acutely stimulates production of nitric oxide (NO) from vascular endothelium to reduce hypertension and improve endothelial dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Herein, we explored additional mechanisms whereby EGCG may mediate beneficial cardiovascular actions. When compared with vehicle-treated controls, EGCG treatment (2.5 mu M, 8 h) of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) caused a similar to three-fold increase in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA and protein with comparable increases in HO-1 activity. This was unaffected by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059 or L-NAME (PI 3-kinase, MEK and NO synthase inhibitors, respectively). Pretreatment of HAEC with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK completely blocked EGCG-stimulated induction of HO-1. EGCG treatment also inhibited tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-stimulated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and decreased adhesion of monocytes to HAEC. siRNA knockdown of HO-1, p38 MAPK or Nrf-2 blocked these inhibitory actions of EGCG. In HAEC transiently transfected with a human HO-1 promoter luciferase reporter (or an isolated Nrf-2 responsive region), luciferase activity increased in response to EGCG. This was inhibitable by SB203580 pretreatment. EGCG-stimulated expression of HO-1 and Nrf-2 was blocked by siRNA knockdown of Nrf-2 or p38 MAPK. Finally, liver from mice chronically treated with EGCG had increased HO-1 and decreased VCAM-1 expression. Thus, in vascular endothelium, EGCG requires p38 MAPK to increase expression of Nrf-2 that drives expression of HO-1, resulting in increased HO-1 activity. Increased HO-1 expression may underlie anti-inflammatory actions of EGCG in vascular endothelium that may help mediate beneficial cardiovascular actions of green tea. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of garlic oil (GO) or diallyl disulfide (DADS) imparted hepatoprotection against alcohol induced fatty liver in C57BL/6 mice using microarray-based global gene expression analysis. Alcohol liquid diet resulted in severe fatty liver with increased levels of serum aspartate aminotransferease and alanine aminotransferease as well as triglycerides and decreased levels of liver glutathione and antioxidant enzymes. The major canonical pathways implicated by alcohol treatment are the metabolisms of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, glutathione, and arachidonic acid. Treatment with DADS or GO normalized the serum aminotransferease levels and liver antioxidant enzymes and reduced the contents of triglycerides and cholesterol. The canonical pathways involved in the amelioration of liver include arachidonic acid metabolism, altered T cell and B cell signaling, tryptophan metabolism, antigen presentation pathway for DADS, metabolism of xenobiotics, mitotic roles of Polo-like kinase, fatty acid metabolism, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function, and C21-steroid hormone metabolism for GO",

This study was conducted to elucidate the action mode of curcumin alleviation of oxidative stress in heat-stressed quail. A total of 180 birds (10 d old) were assigned randomly to be reared at either 22 degrees C (Thermoneutral) or 34 degrees C (Heat stress) for 8 h/d (0900-1700) until the age of 42 d. Birds in both environments were randomly fed 1 of 3 diets: basal diet and basal diet added with 0, 200 or 400 mg of curcumin per kg of diet. Each of the 2 x 3 factorially arranged experimental groups was replicated in 10 cages, each containing three birds. In response to increasing supplemental curcumin level, there were linear increases in cumulative feed intake, final body weight, and weight gain, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor two level and heme oxygenase one level; linear decreases in feed efficiency, serum, muscle and liver malondialdehyde level, respectively and inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B and heat shock proteins 70 level (P < 0.0001 for all).

		"abstract": "Genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have identified several variants that predispose individuals to developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the gene that has been consistently involved in the genetic susceptibility of NAFLD in humans is patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3, also known as adiponutrin). A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in PNPLA3 (rs738409 C/G, a coding variant that encodes an amino acid substitution I148M) is significantly associated with fatty liver and histological disease severity, not only in adults but also in children. Nevertheless, how PNPLA3 influences the biology of fatty liver disease is still an open question. A recent article describes new aspects about PNPLA3 gene/protein function and suggests that the I148M variant promotes hepatic lipid synthesis due to a gain of function. We revise here the published data about the role of the I148M variant in lipogenesis/lipolysis, and suggest putative areas of future research. For instance we explored in silico whether the rs738409 C or G alleles have the ability to modify miRNA binding sites and miRNA gene regulation, and we found that prediction of PNPLA3 target miRNAs shows two miRNAs potentially interacting in the 3' UTR region (hsa-miR-769-3p and hsa-miR-516a-3p). In addition, interesting unanswered questions remain to be explored. For example, PNPLA3 lies between two CCCTC-binding factor-bound sites that could be tested for insulator activity, and an intronic histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation peak predicts an enhancer element, corroborated by the DNase I hypersensitivity site peak. Finally, an interaction between PNPLA3 and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2 is suggested by data miming. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Intestinal barrier defects are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of naringenin, a citrus polyphenol, on intestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier defects and inflammation in a murine model of colitis. In Expt. 1, using a 2 x 2 fractional design, the mice were administered water or 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in combination with feeding control or naringenin-containing diets for 9 d (severe disease stage). DSS administration caused severe colon damage and inflammation, as indicated by body weight loss, increased clinical sores, colon shortening: and gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines [interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and IL-17A). DSS administration also impaired TJ barrier integrity in the colon, as indicated by increased colon permeability and plasma LPS-binding protein levels, resulting from the impaired colonic expression of TJ proteins, occludin, junctional adhesion molecule-A, and claudin-3. Supplemental feeding with naringenin totally or partially attenuated these symptoms, suggesting that naringenin ameliorates the DSS-induced colitis, at least partially through protection of the TJ barrier. In Expt. 2, analyses were performed at different disease stages (cl 3, 6, and 9) to more widely examine the ameliorative role of naringenin on the initiation and development of colitis. DSS administration moderately induced colon shortening at d 3 and 6 and increased the disease activity index (DAI) and inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and IL-17A) expression without any significant increases in colonic permeability. Feeding naringenin attenuated the increased DAI and colon shortening and tended to suppress the increased cytokine expression. These findings suggest that the presence of an additional mechanism underlying the naringenin-mediated, anticolitic effect along with barrier protection.",

However, its effects in endogenous antioxidant biomarkers are not clearly understood. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that green tea supplementation will upregulate antioxidant parameters (enzymatic and nonenzymatic) in adults with the metabolic syndrome. Thirty-five obese participants with the metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to receive one of the following for 8 weeks: green tea (4 cups per day), control (4 cups water per day), or green tea extract (2 capsules and 4 cups water per day). Blood samples and dietary information were collected at baseline (0 week) and 8 weeks of the study. Circulating carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene) and tocopherols (alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol) and trace elements were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, respectively. Serum antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, catalase) and plasma antioxidant capacity were measured spectrophotometrically. Green tea beverage and green tea extract significantly increased plasma antioxidant capacity (1.5 to 2.3 mu mol/L and 1.2 to 2.5 mu mol/L, respectively; P < .05) and whole blood glutathione (1783 to 2395 mu g/g hemoglobin and 1905 to 2751 mu g/g hemoglobin, respectively; P < .05) vs controls at 8 weeks. No effects were noted in serum levels of carotenoids and tocopherols and glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. Green tea extract significantly reduced plasma iron vs baseline (128 to 92 mu g/dL, P < .02), whereas copper, zinc, and selenium were not affected. These results support the hypothesis that green tea may provide antioxidant protection in the metabolic syndrome. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Background: Red wine polyphenols can prevent cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Resveratrol, the most extensively studied constituent, is unlikely to solely account for these beneficial effects because of its rather low abundance and bioavailability. Malvidin is far the most abundant polyphenol in red wine; however, very limited data are available about its effect on inflammatory processes and kinase signaling pathways. Methods & Findings: The present study was carried out by using RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide in the presence and absence of malvidin. From the cells, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase B/Akt and poly ADP-ribose polymerase, reactive oxygen species production, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression and mitochondrial depolarization were determined. We found that malvidin attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear factor-kappaB, poly ADP-ribose polymerase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial depolarization, while upregulated the compensatory processes; mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression and Akt activation. Conclusions: These effects of malvidin may explain the previous findings and at least partially account for the positive effects of moderate red wine consumption on inflammation-mediated chronic maladies such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",

Indomethacin decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance and increased the permeability of the monolayers to fluorescein-dextran. These alterations were abolished by all the tested polyphenols but ruin, with quercetin being the most efficient. The protective effect of quercetin was associated with its capacity to inhibit the redistribution of ZO-1 protein induced in the tight junction by indomethacin or rotenone, a mitochondrial complex-I inhibitor, and to prevent the decrease of ZO-1 and occludin expression induced by indomethacin. The fact that the antioxidant polyphenols assayed in this study differ in their protective capacity against the epithelial damage induced by indomethacin suggests that this damage is due to the ability of this agent to induce not only oxidative stress but alos mitochondrial dysfunction.",

		"abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant cellular thiol antioxidant and it exhibits numerous and versatile functions. Disturbances in GSH homeostasis have been associated with liver diseases induced by drugs, alcohol, diet and environmental pollutants. Until recently, our laboratories and others have developed mouse models with genetic deficiencies in glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in the GSH biosynthetic pathway. This review focuses on regulation of GSH homeostasis and, specifically, recent studies that have utilized such GSH-deficient mouse models to investigate the role of GSH in liver disease processes. These studies have revealed a differential hepatic response to distinct profiles of hepatic cellular GSH concentration. In particular, mice engineered to not express the catalytic subunit of GCL in hepatocytes [Gclc(h/h) mice] experience almostcomplete loss of hepatic GSH (to 5% of normal) and develop spontaneous liver pathologies characteristic of various clinical stages of liver injury. In contrast, mice globally engineered to not express the modifier subunit of GCL [Gclm(-/-) mice] show a less severe hepatic GSH deficit (to approximate to 15% of normal) and exhibit overall protection against liver injuries induced by a variety of hepatic insults. Collectively, these transgenic mouse models provide interesting new insights regarding pathophysiological functions of GSH in the liver. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Objective: We investigated the ADME of a C-13(5)-labeled anthocyanin in humans. Design: Eight male participants consumed 500 mg isotopically labeled cyanidin-3-glucoside (6,8,10,3',5'-C-13(5)-C3G). Biological samples were collected over 48 h, and C-13 and C-13-labeled metabolite concentrations were measured by using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: The mean +/- SE percentage of C-13 recovered in urine, breath, and feces was 43.9 +/- 25.9% (range: 15.1-99.3% across participants). The relative bioavailability was 12.38 +/- 1.38% (5.37 +/- 0.67% excreted in urine and 6.91 +/- 1.59% in breath). Maximum rates of C-13 elimination were achieved 30 min after ingestion (32.53 +/- 14.24 mu g C-13/h), whereas C-13-labeled metabolites peaked (maximum serum concentration: 5.97 +/- 2.14 mu mol/L) at 10.25 +/- 4.14 h. The half-life for C-13-labeled metabolites ranged between 12.44 +/- 4.22 and 51.62 +/- 22.55 h. C-13 elimination was greatest between 0 and 1 h for urine (90.30 +/- 15.28 mu g/h), at 6 h for breath (132.87 +/- 32.23 mu g/h), and between 6 and 24 h for feces (557.28 +/- 247.88 mu g/h), whereas the highest concentrations of C-13-labeled metabolites were identified in urine (10.77 +/- 4.52 mu mol/L) and fecal samples (43.16 +/- 18.00 mu mol/L) collected between 6 and 24 h. Metabolites were identified as degradation products, phenolic, hippuric, phenylacetic, and phenylpropenoic acids.

		"abstract": "Recent studies indicate that metabolic oxidative stress, autophagy, and inflammation are hallmarks of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression. However, the molecular mechanisms that link these important events in NASH remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic role of purinergic receptor X7 (P2X7) in modulating autophagy and resultant inflammation in NASH in response to metabolic oxidative stress. The study uses two rodent models of NASH. In one of them, a CYP2E1 substrate bromodichloromethane is used to induce metabolic oxidative stress and NASH. Methyl choline-deficient diet feeding is used for the other NASH model. CYP2E1 and P2X7 receptor gene-deleted mice are used to establish their roles in regulating metabolic oxidative stress and autophagy. Autophagy gene expression, protein levels, confocal microscopy based-immunolocalization of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)2A and histopathological analysis were performed. CYP2E1-dependent metabolic oxidative stress induced increases in P2X7 receptor expression and chaperone-mediated autophagy markers LAMP2A and heat shock cognate 70 but caused depletion of light chain 3 isoform B (LC3B) protein levels. P2X7 receptor gene deletion significantly decreased LAMP2A and inflammatory indicators while significantly increasing LC3B protein levels compared with wild-type mice treated with bromodichloromethane. P2X7 receptor-deleted mice were also protected from NASH pathology as evidenced by decreased inflammation and fibrosis. Our studies establish that P2X7 receptor is a key regulator of autophagy induced by metabolic oxidative stress in NASH, thereby modulating hepatic inflammation. Furthermore, our findings presented here form a basis for P2X7 receptor as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment for NASH.",

		"abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) boost the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs), and thereby play important roles in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a protein deacetylase, is known to markedly protect cells from oxidative stress (OSS) injury. Based on the critical involvements of AGEs and Sirt1 in OSS, Sirt1 is postulated to resist AGEsinduced diabetic renal fibrosis through its antioxidative effects. The current study was designed to explore the inhibitory effect of Sirt1 on the expressions of fibronectin (FN) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induced by AGEs in GMCs. The molecular mechanism by which Sirt1 promoted the activation of the antioxidative pathway was further investigated. The following findings were obtained: (1) the treatment of GMCs with AGEs decreased Sirt1 levels in terms of protein expression and activity but increased FN and TGF-beta 1 levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner; (2) resveratrol or Sirt1 overexpression markedly increased Sirt1 levels and reduced FN and TGF-beta 1 expressions; (3) inhibition of Sirt1 activity further induced the productions of FN and TGF-beta 1; (4) Sirt1 promoted the nuclear accumulation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of Nrf2 and upregulated the expressions of Nrf2 downstream genes, heme oxygenase-1, and superoxide dismutase 1; ROS levels induced by AGEs eventually reduced in a deacetylase-dependent manner; and (5) with the deposition of AGEs in the kidneys, the diabetic rats suffered severe renal dysfunction and high OSS levels; resveratrol treatment evidently diminished the OSS levels, ameliorated renal injury, and prevented the expressions of FN and TGF-beta 1 in the kidneys of diabetic rats. This work supports a negative role of Sirt1 in AGE-induced overproductions of FN and TGF-beta 1 The molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of Sirtl on DN correlate well with the activation of the Nrf2/ARE antioxidative pathway.

		"abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is linked to type 2 diabetes and risk factors associated to the metabolic syndrome. Consumption of dietary fibres has been shown to have positive metabolic health effects, such as by increasing satiety, lowering blood glucose and cholesterol levels. These effects may be associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric acids, formed by microbial degradation of dietary fibres in colon, and by their capacity to reduce low-grade inflammation. Objective: To investigate whether dietary fibres, giving rise to different SCFAs, would affect metabolic risk markers in low-fat and high-fat diets using a model with conventional rats for 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Material and Methods: Conventional rats were administered low-fat or high-fat diets, for 2, 4 or 6 weeks, supplemented with fermentable dietary fibres, giving rise to different SCFA patterns (pectin - acetic acid; guar gum - propionic acid; or a mixture - butyric acid). At the end of each experimental period, liver fat, cholesterol and triglycerides, serum and caecal SCFAs, plasma cholesterol, and inflammatory cytokines were analysed. The caecal microbiota was analysed after 6 weeks. Results and Discussion: Fermentable dietary fibre decreased weight gain, liver fat, cholesterol and triglyceride content, and changed the formation of SCFAs. The high-fat diet primarily reduced formation of SCFAs but, after a longer experimental period, the formation of propionic and acetic acids recovered. The concentration of succinic acid in the rats increased in high-fat diets with time, indicating harmful effect of high-fat consumption. The dietary fibre partly counteracted these harmful effects and reduced inflammation. Furthermore, the number of Bacteroides was higher with guar gum, while noticeably that of Akkermansia was highest with the fibre-free diet.",

		"abstract": "CYP2E1 metabolizes ethanol leading to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acetaldehyde, which are known to cause not only liver damage but also toxicity to other organs. However, the signaling pathways involved in CYP2E1 regulation by ethanol are not clear, especially in extra-hepatic cells. This study was designed to examine the role of CYP2E1 in ethanol-mediated oxidative stress and cytotoxicity, as well as signaling pathways by which ethanol regulates CYP2E1 in extra-hepatic cells. In this study, we used astrocytic and monocytic cell lines, because they are important cells in central nervous system. Our results showed that 100 mM ethanol significantly induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cell death at 24 h in the SVGA astrocytic cell line, which was rescued by a CYP2E1 selective inhibitor, diallyl sulfide (DAS), CYP2E1 siRNA, and antioxidants (vitamins C and E). Further, we showed that DAS and vitamin C abrogated ethanol-mediated (50 mM) induction of CYP2E1 at 6 h, as well as production of ROS at 2 h, suggesting the role of oxidative stress in ethanol-mediated induction of CYP2E1. We then investigated the role of the protein kinase C/c-Jun N-terminal kinase/specificity protein1 (PKC/JNK/SP1) pathway in oxidative stress-mediated CYP2E1 induction. Our results showed that staurosporine, a non-specific inhibitor of PKC, as well as specific PKC zeta inhibitor and PKC zeta siRNA, abolished ethanol-induced CYP2E1 expression. In addition, inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and SP1 (mithramycin A) completely abrogated induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol in SVGA astrocytes. Subsequently, we showed that CYP2E1 is also responsible for ethanol-mediated oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death in U937 monocytic cell lines. Finally, our results showed that PKC/JNK/SP1 pathway is also involved in regulation of CYP2E1 in U937 cells. This study has clinical implications with respect to alcohol-associated neuroinflammatory toxicity among alcohol users.

		"abstract": "The hepatoprotective activity of the aqueous extract of the shells of pecan nut was investigated against ethanol-induced liver damage. This by-product of the food industry is popularly used to treat toxicological diseases. We evaluated the phytochemical properties of pecan shell aqueous extract (AE) and its in vitro and ex vivo antioxidant activity. The AE was found to have a high content of total polyphenols (192.4 +/- 1.9 mg GAE/g), condensed tannins (58.4 +/- 2.2 mg CE/g), and antioxidant capacity, and it inhibited Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation (LP) in vitro. Rats chronically treated with ethanol (Et) had increased plasmatic transaminases (ALT, AST) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels (96%, 59.13% and 465.9%, respectively), which were effectively prevented (87; 41 and 383%) by the extract (1:40, w/v). In liver, ethanol consumption increased the LP (121%) and decreased such antioxidant defenses as glutathione (GSH) (33%) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (47%) levels, causing genotoxicity in erythrocytes. Treatment with pecan shell AE prevented the development of LP (43%), GSH and SOD depletion (33% and 109%, respectively) and ethanol-induced erythrocyte genotoxicity. Catalase activity in the liver was unchanged by ethanol but was increased by the extract (47% and 73% in AE and AE + Et, respectively). Therefore, pecan shells may be an economic agent to treat liver diseases related to ethanol consumption. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "SirT1 is a class III histone deacetylase that has been implicated in metabolic and reactive oxygen species control. In the vasculature it has been shown to decrease endothelial superoxide production, prevent endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms that mediate SirT1 antioxidant functions remain to be characterized. The transcription factor FoxO3a and the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor -coactivator 1 (PGC-1) have been shown to induce the expression of antioxidant genes and to be deacetylated by SirT1. Aims: Here we investigated SirT1 regulation of antioxidant genes and the roles played by FoxO3a and PGC-1 in this regulation. Results: We found that SirT1 regulates the expression of several antioxidant genes in bovine aortic endothelial cells, including Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase, peroxiredoxins 3 and 5 (Prx3, Prx5), thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), thioredoxin reductase 2 (TR2), and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) and can be localized in the regulatory regions of these genes. We also found that knockdown of either FoxO3a or PGC-1 prevented the induction of antioxidant genes by SirT1 over-expression. Furthermore, SirT1 increased the formation of a FoxO3a/PGC-1 complex as determined by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assays, concomitantly reducing H2O2-dependent FoxO3a and PGC-1 acetylation. Data showing that FoxO3a knockdown increases PGC-1 acetylation levels and vice versa, suggest that SirT1 activity on FoxO3a and PGC-1 may be dependent of the formation of a FoxO3a/PGC-1 complex. Innovation: A unifying mechanism for SirT1 activities is suggested. Conclusion: We show that SirT1 regulation of antioxidant genes in vascular endothelial cells depends on the formation of a FoxO3a/PGC-1 complex. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 19, 1507-1521.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) can be developed by a prolonged or large intake of alcohol in a short period of time. ALD is considered as a leading cause for a liver injury in modern dietary life. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of orally administrated citrus flavonoids (CFs) and their enzymatically modified ones (EM-CFs) to prevent ALD. Hesperidin and narirutin were extracted from peels of Citrus unshiu by ultra-sonication and purified further. These CFs were modified enzymatically through glycosylation and de-rhamnosylation by the actions of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) and hesperidinase, respectively. CFs and EM-CFs were fed to ICR mouse along with ethanol for 8 weeks, and changes in lipid contents, lipid peroxidation. GSH, antioxidant enzymes activity and proinflammatory cytokines in hepatic tissues were observed. Administration of CFs and EM-CFs along with alcohol significantly suppressed increases in prognostic parameters of a hepatocellular injury. Especially, EM-CFs fed groups maintained malondialdehyde, GSH levels and catalase activity in hepatic tissues close to those of the normal diet fed group. Abrupt increases in proinflammatory cytokines such as I kappa B-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in hepatocytes due to a chronic alcohol uptake were significantly suppressed by co-administration of EM-CFs. These results indicate that although the administration of CFs can alleviate ALD through preventing excessive lipid formation, protecting the antioxidant system and suppressing induction of inflammation in hepatocytes, their effectiveness can be further improved by glycosylation and de-rhamnosylation.

		"abstract": "This study aimed to demonstrate protective activities of the narirutin fraction from peels of Citrus unshiu against ethanol-induced hepatic damage through an animal study. Citrus narirutin fraction (CNF), contained 75% of narirutin, was obtained by an ultra-sonicated extraction and further purification. ICR mice were divided into four groups; normaldiet control, ethanol control (6.5 g ethanol/kg), low-CNF (ethanol + 150 mg CNF/kg) and high-CNF (ethanol + 300 mg CNF/kg) groups. Consumption of alcohol for 8 weeks induced severe liver damage with increases in prognostic indicators such as aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase in serum whereas co-administration of CNF suppressed their increases. Excessive accumulations in liver TG and TC in ethanol control group were also suppressed by co-administration of CNF. Co-administration of CNF maintained SOD activity, GSH and malondialdehyde levels close to those of the normal diet group. Chronic consumption of alcohol also stimulated abrupt increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta in liver otherwise co-administration of CNF effectively suppressed production of these cytokines dose-dependently. These results indicate that co-administration of CNF with alcohol can alleviate alcohol induced liver damage through preventing lipid formation, protecting antioxidant system and suppressing productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

		"abstract": "Oxidative damages in hepatocytes may be caused by epilepsy and/or anticonvulsant drugs. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by recurrent seizures, which may increase the content of reactive oxygen species. Organic and conventional grape juices are rich in polyphenols, compounds with important antioxidant activity. It is hypothesized that organic and conventional purple grape juices may have protective effect against oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a standard convulsant drug) in the liver and serum of Wistar rats. Animals (n = 16 in each group) received, by gavage, saline, organic grape juice or conventional grape juice (10 mu L/g of body weight) for 17 days. Subsequently, half of the rats in each group received PTZ (60 mg/kg). After 30 minutes, the animals were euthanized by decapitation. Liver and blood samples were isolated to evaluate oxidative parameters (lipid and protein oxidation, nitric oxide metabolite content, antioxidant defenses, and protein sulfhydryl content). The results of this study showed that although organic juice contains higher polyphenol content than conventional juice, both juices conferred protection against lipid and protein oxidative damage and limited the increase in PTZ-induced nitric oxide metabolite content in the liver and serum. In addition, both juices inhibited the PTZ-induced reduction in enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and sulfhydryl protein content in the liver and serum. In summary, both organic and conventional grape juices were able to reduce oxidative damage induced by PTZ in the liver and serum of Wistar rats. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Living cells maintain a balance between oxidation and reduction, and perturbations of this redox balance are thought to contribute to various diseases. Recent attempts to regulate redox state have focused on electrophiles (EPs), which activate potent cellular defense systems against oxidative stress. One example of this approach is exemplified by carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (CS), compounds that are found in the herb rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Importantly, CA and CS themselves are not electrophilic, but in response to oxidation, become electrophilic, and then activate the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant-response element) transcription pathway to synthesize endogenous antioxidant \"phase 2\" enzymes. As a result of our efforts to develop these compounds as therapeutics for brain health, we have formulated two innovative criteria for drug development: the first concept is the use of pro-electrophilic drugs (PEDs) that are innocuous in and of themselves; and the second concept involves the use of compounds that are pathologically activated therapeutics (PATs);i.e., these small molecules are chemically converted to their active form by the very oxidative stress that they are designed to then combat. The chemical basis for PED and PAT drugs is embodied in the ortho- and para-hydroquinone electrophilic cores of the molecules, which are oxidized by the Cu2+/Cu+ cycling system (or potentially by other transition metals). Importantly, this cycling pathway is under stringent regulation by the cell redox state. We propose that redox-dependent quinone formation is the predominant mechanism for formation of PED and PAT drugs from their precursor compounds. In fact, redox-dependent generation of the active form of drug from the \"pro-form\" distinguishes this therapeutic approach from traditional EPs such as curcumin, and results in a decrease in clinical side effects at therapeutic concentrations, e.g., lack of reaction with other thiols such as glutathione (GSH), which can result in lowering GSH and inducing oxidative stress in normal cells. We consider this pro-drug quality of PED/PAT compoundsto be a key factor for generating drugs to be used to combat neurodegenerative diseases that will be clinically tolerated. Given the contribution of oxidative stress to the pathology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway represents a promising drug target for these PED/PAT agents.

		"abstract": "Several microRNAs (miRNAs) were selected for characterization of their response to insulin signaling based on in silico predictions of targeting CYP2E1 mRNA and previous reports implicating their role in hepatic metabolism and disease. CYP2E1 expression decreases with increasing insulin concentration and has been shown to be regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. In primary cultured rat hepatocytes, insulin at 0.1, 1.0, and 10 nM elevated miRNA-132 and -212 expression similar to 2-and 1.8-fold, respectively, whereas expression of miRNA-181a and -122 increased similar to 1.6-and 1.4-fold, respectively. In contrast, insulin failed to alter significantly the expression of miRNA let-7a. Mechanistic studies using inhibitors of PI3-K, Akt, and mTOR were used to examine the role of the insulin signaling pathway on miR expression and resulted in significant suppression of the insulin-mediated elevation of miR-132, miR-212, and miR-122 levels, with a lesser effect observed for miR-181a. Targeting of the rat CYP2E1 3'-untranslated region (UTR) by miR-132 and -212 was demonstrated with an in vitro luciferase reporter assay. These data show that insulin, which regulates CYP2E1 through the PI3-K, Akt, mTOR signaling pathway, also regulates the expression of miRs that target the 39-UTR of CYP 2E1 mRNA and are involved in the regulation of hepatic metabolism and disease.",

		"abstract": "The transcription factor Nrf2 governs the expression of a considerable group of genes involved in cell protection against oxidants, electrophiles, and genotoxic compounds. The activity of Nrf2 is sensitive to xenobiotics and endogenous electrophiles. Nrf2 is negatively regulated by specific suppressor protein Keap1, which is also a receptor of electrophiles and adapter for Cul3 ubiquitin ligase. Electrophiles react with critical thiol groups of Keap1 leading to the loss of its ability to inhibit Nrf2. The Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway also down-regulates NF-kappa B transcriptional activity and attenuates cytokine-mediated induction of proinflammatory genes. Pharmacological activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway can be used for treatment and prevention of many diseases. Widely known natural Keap1-Nrf2 activators include curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane. The most effective Keap1-Nrf2 activators are synthetic oleanane triterpenoids.",

In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of resveratrol, a polyphenol with antiangiogenic activity in DN. In a type 1 diabetic rat model, resveratrol treatment blunted the increases of urine albumin excretion, kidney weight and creatinine clearance rate. The increases of glomerular diameter, mesangium accumulation, glomerular basement membrane thickness and renal fibrosis in diabetic rats were also reduced by resveratrol treatment. In the diabetic kidney, increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flk-1 and angiopoietin 2, and reduced expression of Tie-2 were observed. These changes in angiogenic hormones and associated receptors were attenuated by resveratrol treatment. No changes in angiopoietin 1 expression were detected among each group of rats. Resveratrol also significantly downregulated high glucose-induced VEGF and Flk-1 expressions in cultured mouse glomerular podocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. These effects were attenuated by knocking-down silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) expression. In contrast, upregulation of Sirt1 in cultured endothelial cells reduced Flk-1 expression. Increased permeability and cellular junction disruption of cultured endothelial cells caused by VEGF were also inhibited by resveratrol pretreatment. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that resveratrol may attenuate DN via modulating angiogenesis.",

		"abstract": "Background: Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is a garlic-derived organosulfur compound. The current study is designed to evaluate the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced oxidative stress, and to explore the underlying mechanisms by examining the HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway. Methods: We investigated whether or not DADS could activate the HO-1 in normal human liver cell LO2, and then evaluated the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced damage in LO2 cells and in acute ethanol-intoxicated mice. The biochemical parameters were measured using commercial kits. HO-1 mRNA level was determined by RT-PCR. Histopathology and immunofluorescence assay were performed with routine methods. Protein levels were measured by western blot. Results: DADS significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of HO-1, stimulated the nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 and increased the phosphorylation of MAPK in LO2 cells. The nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 was abrogated by MAPK inhibitors. DADS significantly suppressed ethanol-induced elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities, decrease of glutathione (GSH) level, increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and apoptosis of LO2 cells, which were all blocked by ZnPPIX. In mice, DADS effectively suppressed acute ethanol-induced elevation of aminotransferase activities, and improved liver histopathological changes, which might be associated with HO-1 activation. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that DADS could induce the activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway, which may contribute to the protective effects of DADS against ethanol-induced liver injury. General significance: DADS may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of ALD due to significant activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The present study aimed at determining the interactions of ethanol with different fat sources at the gut-liver axis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pair fed control or ethanol liquid diet for 8 wk. The liquid diets were based on a modified Lieber-DeCarli formula, with 30% total calories derived from corn oil (rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids). To test the effects of saturated fats, corn oil in the ethanol diet was replaced by either cocoa butter (CB, rich in long-chain saturated fatty acids) or medium-chain triglycerides (MCT, exclusively medium-chain saturated fatty acids). Ethanol feeding increased hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration and perturbed hepatic and serum metabolite profiles. Ethanol feeding with CB or MCT alleviated ethanol-induced liver injury and attenuated ethanol-induced metabolic perturbation. Both CB and MCT also normalized ethanol-induced hepatic macrophage activation, cytokine expression, and neutrophil infiltration. Ethanol feeding elevated serum endotoxin level, which was normalized by MCT but not CB. In accordance, ethanol-induced downregulations of intestinal occludin and zonula occludens-1 were normalized by MCT but not CB. However, CB normalized ethanol-increased hepatic endotoxin level in association with upregulation of an endotoxin detoxifying enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1). Knockdown ASS1 in H4IIEC3 cells resulted in impaired endotoxin clearance and upregulated cytokine expression. These data demonstrate that the protection of saturated fats against alcohol-induced liver injury occur via different actions at the gut-liver axis and are chain length dependent.",

		"abstract": "Objective. A major signaling pathway that regulates cellular aging is the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Akt/FoxO transcription factor axis. We previously observed that FoxO transcription factors are dysregulated in aged and OA cartilage. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of down-regulated FoxO transcription factors on chondrocytes. Methods. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting FOXO1 (siFOXO1) and FOXO3 (siFOXO3) were transfected into human articular chondrocytes. Cell viability following treatment with the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) was measured by MTT assay. Caspase 3/7 activation and apoptotic cells were examined. Gene and protein expression of antioxidant proteins and autophagy-related proteins and changes in inflammatory mediators following treatment with interleukin-1 were assessed. Cells transfected with FOXO plasmids were also analyzed. Results. Cell viability was significantly reduced by siFOXO after treatment with tBHP. Apoptosis accompanied by caspase activation was significantly increased in siFOXO-transfected chondrocytes. Knockdown of FOXO1 and FOXO1 3 resulted in significant reductions in levels of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX-1), catalase, light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin1, and sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) proteins following treatment with tBHP. In contrast, the constitutive active form of FOXO3 increased cell viability while inducing GPX-1, Beclin1, and LC3 in response to tBHP. Expression and production of ADAMTS-4 and chemerin were significantly increased in siFOXO-transfected chondrocytes. Conclusion. Reduced expression of FoxO transcription factors in chondrocytes increased susceptibility to cell death induced by oxidative stress. This was associated with reduced levels of antioxidant proteins and autophagy-related proteins. Our data provide evidence for a key role of FoxO transcription factors as regulators of chondrocyte oxidative stress resistance and tissue homeostasis.",

		"abstract": "Background: Resveratsol is a key component of red wine that has been reported to have anti-carcinogenic and anti-aging properties. Additional studies conducted in vitro and in animal models suggested anti-inflammatory properties. However, data from primary human immune cells and in vivo studies are limited. Methods: A pilot study was performed including 10 healthy volunteers. Plasma cytokine levels were measured over 48 h after oral application of 5 g resveratrol. To verify the in vivo findings, cytokine release and gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or monocytes was assessed after treatment with resveratrol or its metabolites and stimulation with several toll-like receptor (TLR)-agonists. Additionally, the impact on intracellular signaling pathways was analyzed using a reporter cell line and Western blotting. Results: Resveratrol treated individuals showed a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels 24 h after treatment compared to baseline. Studies using human PBMC or isolated monocytes confirmed potentiation of TNF-alpha production with different TLR agonists, while interleukin (IL)-10 was inhibited. Moreover, we observed significantly enhanced nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-kappa B) activation using a reporter cell line and found increased phosphorylation of p105, which is indicative of alternative NF-kappa B pathway activation. General significance: By administering resveratrol to healthy humans and utilizing primary immune cells we were able to detect TNF-alpha enhancing properties of the agent. In parallel, we found enhanced alternative NF-kappa B activation. We report on a novel pro-inflammatory property of resveratrol which has to be considered in concepts of its biologic activity.

		"abstract": "Delivery of optimal amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to regions of the brain affected by neurodegenerative diseases is a daunting task. Using natural products with neuroprotective properties, such as green tea polyphenols, would be a highly useful complementary approach for inexpensive long-term treatment of these diseases. In this study, we used PC12(TrkB) cells which ectopically express TrkB, a high affinity receptor for BDNF. They differentiate and induce neurite outgrowth in response to BDNF. Using this model, we show for the first time that treatment with extremely low concentrations (<0.1 mu g/ml) of unfractionated green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and low concentrations (<0.5 mu M) of their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), potentiated the neuritogenic ability of a low concentration (2 ng/ml) of BDNF. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, where epigallocatechin and epicatechin, both individually lacking this activity, promoted the action of EGCG. GTPP-induced potentiation of BDNF action required the cell-surface associated 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. A cell-permeable catalase abolished GTPP/EGCG-induced potentiation of BDNF action, suggesting the possible involvement of H2O2 in the potentiation. Consistently, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2O2, added as a bolus dose (5 mu M) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1 mu M), potentiated BDNF action. Collectively, these results suggest that EGCG, dependent on 67LR and H2O2, potentiates the neuritogenic action of BDNF. Intriguingly, this effect requires only submicromolar concentrations of EGCG. This is significant as extremely low concentrations of polyphenols are believed to reach the brain after drinking green tea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Hispidin, a phenolic compound from Phellinus linteus (a medicinal mushroom), has been shown to possess strong anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-dementia properties. However, the cardioprotective efficacy of hispidin has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of hispidin against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. While the treatment of H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells with hydrogen peroxide caused a loss of cell viability and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, hispidin significantly protected the cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death without any cytotoxicity as determined by XTT assay, LDH release assay, Hoechst 33342 assay, and Western blotting of apoptosis proteins such as caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2. Our data also shows that hispidin significantly scavenged intracellular ROS, and markedly enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 and catalase, which was accompanied by the concomitant activation of Akt/GSK-3 beta and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. The effects of hispidin on Akt and ERK phosphotylation were abrogated by LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor). The effect of hispidin on GSK-3b activities was also blocked by LY294002. Furthermore, inhibiting the Akt/GSK-3 beta and ERK1/2 pathway by these inhibitors significantly reversed the hispidin-induced Bax and Bcl-2 expression, apoptosis induction, and ROS production. These findings indicate that hispidin protects against apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide through reducing intracellular ROS production, regulating apoptosis-related proteins, and the activation of the Akt/GSK-3 beta and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

		"abstract": "Global brain ischemia-reperfusion causes delayed cell death in hippocampal CA1 (cornus ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons after reperfusion. Ischemic tolerance evoked by preconditioning (IPC) represents a phenomenon of CNS adaptation to any subsequent ischemia. This paper was designed to describe changes in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) protein pathways of the hippocampal area following by IPC. Ischemia was induced by a 4-vessels occlusion (4VO) and the rats were preconditioned by a non-injurious ischemia. Apoptotic markers were used to follow the degeneration process. Western blot and immunohistochemistry identified p-ERK (phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) and p38 proteins in injured hippocampal areas. P-ERK quantification increased after IPC and reached the highest level at 24 hours after ischemia. Interestingly, neuroprotection induced by IPC lead to the opposite effect on MAPK/p38, where the level was lowest at 24 hours after ischemia. Taken together, the present study clearly demonstrates that p-ERK takes part in complex cascades triggered by IPC in the selectively vulnerable hippocampal region. In addition, paper describes a crosstalk between p-ERK and p-p38 which occurs after preconditioning maneuver in 4VO model of global ischemia.",

		"abstract": "Rats artificially selected over several generations for high intrinsic endurance/aerobic capacity resulting in high capacity runners (HCR) has been developed to study the links between high aerobic fitness and protection from metabolic diseases (Wisloff et al., Science, 2005). We have previously shown that the HCR strain have elevated hepatic mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity. In this study, we tested if the elevated hepatic mitochondrial content in the HCR rat would provide “metabolic protection” from chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and injury. The Leiber-Decarli liquid diet with ethanol (7% v/v; HCR-E) and without (HCR-C) was given to HCR rats (n = 8 per group) from 14 to 20 weeks of age that were weight matched and pair-fed to assure isocaloric intake. Hepatic triglyceride (TG) content and macro- and microvesicular steatosis were significantly greater in HCR-E compared with HCR-C (p < 0.05). In addition, hepatic superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the HCR-E rats. This hepatic phenotype also was associated with reduced total hepatic fatty acid oxidation (p = 0.03) and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (p = 0.01), and reductions in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apoB-100 protein content (p = 0.01) in HCR-E animals. However, despite these documented hepatic alterations, ethanol ingestion failed to induce significant hepatic liver injury, including no changes in hepatic inflammation, or serum alanine amino transferase (ALTs), free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides (TGs), insulin, or glucose. High intrinsic aerobic fitness did not reduce ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis, but protected against ethanol-induced hepatic injury and systemic metabolic dysfunction in a high aerobic capacity rat model.",

		"abstract": "Background\nEmerging evidence suggests that taurine acts as a partial agonist at glycine receptors (GlyR) in vitro and in vivo. Ethanol acts as an allosteric modulator at the GlyR producing a leftward shift of the glycine concentration-response curve, with no enhancing effects observed at saturating glycine concentrations. However, to date no electrophysiological studies have been performed on ethanol modulation of taurine-activated GlyR.\n\nMethods\nWildtype α1 GlyR, or those bearing a serine-267 to isoleucine replacement (S267I), were homomerically expressed in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamped at 70 mV. Ethanol was co-applied with varying concentrations of glycine or taurine and the enhancing effects of ethanol compared.\n\nResults\nEthanol potentiated glycine- and taurine-activated GlyR responses in a concentration-dependent manner. It shifted taurine and glycine concentration-response curves to the left, having no effects at saturating agonist concentrations. Chelation of zinc by tricine decreased ethanol enhancement of taurine-gated GlyR function. The S267I mutation prevented ethanol enhancement of taurine-mediated responses as previously also reported for glycine.\n\nConclusion\nEthanol modulates taurine activation of GlyR function by a mechanism similar to that of the full agonist glycine. The lack of effect of ethanol at saturating taurine concentrations provides mechanistic information on alcohol actions at the GlyR.",

		"abstract": "Chronic ethanol feeding decreases expression of adiponectin by adipocytes and circulating adiponectin. Adiponectin treatment during chronic ethanol feeding prevents liver injury in mice. Chronic ethanol feeding also increases oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in adipose tissue. Here we tested the hypothesis that supplemental taurine, an amino acid that functions as a chemical chaperone/osmolyte and enhances cellular anti-oxidant activity, would prevent ethanol-induced decreases in adiponectin expression and attenuate liver injury. Serum adiponectin concentrations decreased as early as 4–7 days after feeding rats a 36% ethanol diet. This rapid decrease was associated with increased oxidative, but not ER, stress in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Taurine prevented ethanol-induced oxidative stress and increased inflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue. Ethanol feeding also rapidly decreased expression of transcription factors regulating adiponectin expression (C/EBPα, PPARγ and PPARα) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Taurine prevented the ethanol-induced decrease in C/EBPα and PPARα normalizing adiponectin mRNA and serum adiponectin concentrations. In the liver, taurine prevented ethanol-induced oxidative stress and attenuated TNF-α expression and steatosis, at least in part, by increasing expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and its combinations with taurine and/or betaine on the level of glutathione (GSH), a powerful antioxidant in the liver, in acute hepatotoxicity induced by ethanol.\n\nMethods\nTo examine the effects of SAMe and its combinations with taurine and/or betaine on ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, AML12 cells and C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with SAMe, taurine, and/or betaine, followed by ethanol challenge. Cell viability was detected with an MTT assay. GSH concentration and mRNA levels of GSH synthetic enzymes were measured using GSH reductase and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured with commercially available kits.\n\nResults\nPretreatment of SAMe, with or without taurine and/or betaine, attenuated decreases in GSH levels and mRNA expression of the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis, in ethanol-treated cells and mice. mRNA levels of the modifier subunit of GCL and glutathione synthetase were increased in mice treated with SAMe combinations. SAMe, taurine, and/or betaine pretreatment restored serum ALT and AST levels to control levels in the ethanol-treated group.\n\nConclusions\nCombinations of SAMe with taurine and/or betaine have a hepatoprotective effect against ethanol-induced liver injury by maintaining GSH homeostasis.",

		"abstract": "Zinc plays a key role in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity, while alcohol dependency can lead to low zinc status. Complexes containing zinc have been reported to have better ability to protect gastric mucosa than the compounds alone. In this study, taurine zinc [Zn(NH3CH2CH2SO3)2] solid dispersions (SDs) were synthesized and investigated in an ethanol-induced ulcer model in rats. Gastric ulcer index; gastric mucosa malondialdehyde (MDA) level, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production; and serum nitric oxide (NO) were assessed and histological analysis of the gastric mucosa tissue was performed. Taurine zinc (100, 200 mg/kg) SDs protected rat gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced injury. Moreover, the gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc SDs was accompanied by a decrease in serum NO and significant increase in gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). When indomethacin, a non-selective COX inhibitor was administered before the last dose of taurine zinc, the gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc was weakened. Furthermore, taurine zinc (200 mg/kg) SDs protected against ulceration more significantly than the same dose of taurine alone, suggesting a synergistic effect between taurine and zinc. These results indicate taurine zinc protects the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced damage by elevating antioxidants, decreasing lipid peroxidation and inhibiting the production of nitric oxide. The gastroprotective effect of taurine zinc was also partially mediated by endogenous PGE2 production.",

It is therefore suggested that enhancement of cysteine catabolism into taurine contributes to the depletion of hepatic glutathione, which could exacerbate the ethanol-induced oxidative liver injury.",

Over accumulation of iron and a loss in taurine in hepatic tissue was observed in fibrotic animals. The activities of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase were significantly reduced in these rats compared to control. Adaptive induction of activities of Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) and aniline hydroxylase accompanied by the reduction in glutathione-S-transferase, DT-diaphorase and glyoxalases I and II was observed. Taurine administration (2% in drinking water) ameliorated the effects of ethanol and iron. Hepatic damage and fibrosis were reduced in taurine-supplemented rats.

Male SD rats were fed for 8 wk a liquid form of a control diet (CD), an ethanol diet (ED), or a taurine-supplemented ethanol diet (TED). Plasma Se and Mn concentrations were significantly lower in the ED rats than in the CD rats; dietary taurine supplementation corrected alcohol-induced decreases in plasma Se and Mn levels. Chronic alcohol consumption significantly increased urinary excretion of Se (a 53% increase, p < 0.05), Cr (a 62% increase, p < 0.05), Mn (a 45% increase, p < 0.05) and Cu (a 30% increase, p < 0.05) in rats. Urinary losses of these trace elements induced by chronic alcohol consumption in rats were abolished by taurine supplementation. These results suggest that taurine supplementation in rats may protect against Se, Cr and Mn insufficiency caused by chronic alcohol-mediated loss of the trace elements in the urine.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol misuse and addiction is a worldwide problem causing enormous individual suffering as well as financial costs for the society. To develop pharmacological means to reduce suffering, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of ethanol in the brain. Ethanol is known to increase extracellular levels of both dopamine and taurine in the nucleus accumbens (nAc), a part of the brain reward system, but the two events have not been connected. In previous studies we have demonstrated that glycine receptors in the nAc are involved in modulating both basal- and ethanol-induced dopamine output in the same brain region. By means of in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats we here demonstrate that the endogenous glycine receptor ligand taurine mimics ethanol in activating the brain reward system. Furthermore, administration of systemic ethanol diluted in an isotonic (0.9% NaCl) or hypertonic (3.6% NaCl) saline solution was investigated with respect to extracellular levels of taurine and dopamine in the nAc. We found that ethanol given in a hypertonic solution, contrary to an isotonic solution, failed to increase concentrations of both taurine and dopamine in the nAc. However, a modest, non-dopamine elevating concentration of taurine in the nAc disclosed a dopamine elevating effect of systemic ethanol also when given in a hypertonic solution. We conclude that the elevations of taurine and dopamine in the nAc are closely related and that in order for ethanol to induce dopamine release, a simultaneous increase of extracellular taurine levels in the nAc is required. These data also -provide support for the notion that the nAc is the primary target for ethanol in its dopamine-activating effect after systemic administration and that taurine is a prominent participant in activating the brain reward system.",

		"abstract": "Background\nBackground\n\nChronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.\n\nObjectives\nObjectives\n\nTo compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.\n\nSearch methods\nSearch methods\n\nWe updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years).\nWe identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies.\nA separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005).\nFinal update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.\n\nSelection criteria\nSelection criteria\n\nRandomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.\n\nData collection and analysis\nData collection and analysis\n\nOne author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.\n\nMain results\nMain results\n\nThis update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies.\nWhen used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo.\nHead-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings.\nFor both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nAuthors' conclusions\n\nCorticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.",

Our results show that addition of glutamine to culture medium significantly improved the disruption of integrity caused by ethanol, which was associated with increased expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Ethanol exposure moderately activates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which was characterized by increased DNA-binding activity and phosphorylation status of HSF1. Remarkably, glutamine treatment enhanced ethanol-mediated expression of Hsp70 and activation of HSF1. Up-regulation of Hsp70 by pretreatment with heat stress also promoted recovery from the ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction.

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease is associated with zinc decrease in the liver. Therefore, we examined whether dietary zinc supplementation could provide protection from alcoholic liver injury. Metallothionein-knockout and wild-type 129/Sv mice were pair-fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 12 weeks, and the effects of zinc supplementation on ethanol-induced liver injury were analyzed. Zinc supplementation attenuated ethanol-induced hepatic zinc depletion and liver injury as measured by histopathological and ultrastructural changes, serum alanine transferase activity, and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α in both metallothionein-knockout and wild-type mice, indicating a metallothionein-independent zinc protection. Zinc supplementation inhibited accumulation of reactive oxygen species, as indicated by dihydroethidium fluorescence, and the consequent oxidative damage, as assessed by immunohistochemical detection of 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine and quantitative analysis of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in the liver. Zinc supplementation suppressed ethanol-elevated cytochrome P450 2E1 activity but increased the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, without affecting the rate of blood ethanol elimination. Zinc supplementation also prevented ethanol-induced decreases in glutathione concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity and increased glutathione reductase activity in the liver. In conclusion, zinc supplementation prevents alcoholic liver injury in an metallothionein-independent manner by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species (P450 2E1) and enhancing the activity of antioxidant pathways.",

		"abstract": "Acute ethanol exposure causes liver injury in experimental animals, and accumulating evidence suggests that a major responsible factor for the pathogenesis is endotoxemia, which results from bacterial endotoxin leakage from the small intestine due to increased intestinal permeability under alcohol challenge. The purpose of this study was to examine whether zinc pretreatment would inhibit acute ethanol-induced liver injury through prevention of intestinal permeability changes. Male 129 SvPCJ mice were treated with three intragastric doses of ZnSO4 at 5 mg of zinc ion per kg each dosing prior to acute ethanol challenge with a single oral dose of 6 g/kg ethanol. The zinc treatment did not alter the elevation of serum concentrations of alcohol. The acute ethanol exposure caused an elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase levels as well as fatty liver and hepatic degenerative necrotic foci as determined by biochemical assay and histochemical analysis, respectively. A significant increase in liver tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These pathological effects correlated well with increases in serum endotoxin levels. Importantly, acute ethanol treatment caused significant damage to the small intestine as determined by morphological analysis of intestinal sections and permeability assay. These alcohol-induced hepatic pathological changes and TNF-α elevation were significantly inhibited in the zinc-pretreated animals. The inhibitory action of zinc on alcohol-induced liver damage and activation of inflammation was associated with zinc suppression of alcohol-induced intestinal permeability changes. These results thus demonstrate that zinc prevention of increased intestinal permeability is importantly involved in the inhibition of acute ethanol-induced liver damage in mice.",

In vitro, aspirin clearly decreased the activity of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase in human subjects and in rat models, but not that of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase in rats.

		"abstract": "Aspirin increases blood alcohol levels after post-prandial alcohol consumption in men. This was attributed to a decrease in first pass metabolism secondary to inhibition of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase. Since accelerated gastric emptying, decreased volume of distribution or delayed elimination could also result in higher blood alcohol levels, we investigated the effect of aspirin (1 g taken with a meal) on these parameters. Aspirin did not change the volume of ethanol distribution or the rate of its elimination. Moreover, it did not have a significant effect on gastric emptying. The half-time of 99mTc-DTPA loss was 65.5 ± 5.4 minutes without and 71.3 ± 6.5, with aspirin. Despite a trend for slower gastric emptying with aspirin, the alcohol bioavailability increased and was associated with a 39% decrease in the first pass metabolism of alcohol (from 106 ± 4 to 65 ± 19 mg/kg, p < 0.05), consistent with the inhibition of gastric ADH activity. In keeping with this interpretation, the effect of aspirin was virtually absent in women, who have a much smaller first pass metabolism available for inhibition by aspirin.",

This study aims to determine the prevalence and odds of depressive symptoms and clinical depression in psoriasis. A systematic literature search was conducted. Mean questionnaire values and proportions for depressive symptoms and clinical depression were pooled according to different assessment methods. In controlled studies, standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratio (OR) compared depression in psoriasis patients with controls using the random-effect model. The majority of the 98 eligible studies were conducted in tertiary centers without a control group. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 28% using questionnaires and the prevalence of clinical depression was 12% using International Classification of Diseases codes, 19% using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, and 9% for antidepressant use. Psoriasis patients had significantly more depressive symptoms (SMD 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–1.66), and population-based studies showed that they were at least one and a half times more likely to experience depression (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.40–1.76) and used more antidepressants than did controls (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.53–11.76). More than 10% of psoriasis patients suffer from clinical depression, and twice as many have depressive symptoms. The high prevalence of these symptoms is likely to be affected by the tertiary study populations and differential misclassification using questionnaires, where psoriasis-related symptoms may be detected as depressive symptoms.",

Drugs that have been associated with the precipitation or exacerbation of psoriasis include lithium, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and antimalarials.

The main purpose of this study was to report fluoxetine-induced psoriasis in two Chinese women.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Although both patients had been taking fluoxetine for an extended period of time, the time scale of these two case studies suggests that fluoxetine played a causative role in these patients' psoriasis.",

		"abstract": "Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in red wine, has wide spectrum of pharmacological properties including antioxidative and antiaging activities. Beta amyloid peptides (Aβ) are known to involve cognitive impairment, neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of cAMP and/or cGMP activities can improve memory performance and decrease the neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, it remains unknown whether the memory enhancing effect of resveratrol on AD associated cognitive disorders is related to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and subsequent increases in intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP activities. This study investigated the effect of resveratrol on Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairment and the participation of PDE4 subtypes related cAMP or cGMP signaling. Mice microinfused with Aβ1-42 into bilateral CA1 subregions displayed learning and memory impairment, as evidenced by reduced memory acquisition and retrieval in the water maze and retention in the passive avoidance tasks; it was also significant that neuroinflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors were increased in Aβ1-42-treated mice. Aβ1-42-treated mice also increased in PDE4A, 4B and 4D expression, and decreased in PKA level. However, PKA inhibitor H89, but not PKG inhibitor KT5823, prevented resveratrol's effects on these parameters. Resveratrol also reversed Aβ1-42-induced decreases in phosphorylated cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic factor BCl-2 expression, which were reversed by H89. These findings suggest that resveratrol reversing Aβ-induced learning and memory disorder may involve the regulation of neuronal inflammation and apoptosis via PDE4 subtypes related cAMP-CREB-BDNF signaling.",

Prior gastric administration of honey (2.5 g/kg) to animals induced a net reduction of hemorrhagic lesions length of the mucosa. Protection of the stomach elicited by both types of honey and gfsm was almost total against ethanol-induced lesions. Similar results were also observed when using asa-hcl except that the percent protection was 87%. The percent reduction of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was variable according to the nature of the test solution: gfsm mixture (41.1%) &lt; polyfloral honey (55.2%) &lt; monofloral honey (64.0%). Perfusion of the stomach with isotonic honey resulted in (1) a 70% reduction of the area of the lesions caused by ethanol, (2) the failure to prevent the transmural potential difference fall induced by ethanol, (3) an increase of basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion. These results suggest that sugar rich solutions (gfsm and honey) may prevent gastric damage by a mechanism involving the release of some protective agents.",

		"abstract": "Background: The enhanced vulnerability of women to develop alcohol-related diseases may be due to their higher blood alcohol levels after drinking, but the mechanism for this effect is debated. \nMethods: Sixty-five healthy volunteers of both genders drank 0.3 g of ethanol/kg of body weight (as 5%, 10%, or 40% solutions) postprandially. Blood alcohol concentrations were monitored by breath analysis and compared with those after intravenous infusion of the same dose. First-pass metabolism was quantified (using Michaelis-Menten kinetics) as the route-dependent difference in the amount of ethanol reaching the systemic blood.  Gastric  emptying  was  assessed  by  nuclear  scanning  after  intake of  300 m Curie  of technetium-labeled diethylene triamine pentacetic acid in 10% ethanol. The activities of alcohol dehydro- genase isozymes were assessed in 58 gastric biopsies, using preferred substrates for g -ADH (acetaldehyde) and for s -ADH ( m -nitrobenzaldehyde) and a specific reaction of x -ADH (glutathione-dependent formal- dehyde dehydrogenase). Results: Women had less first-pass metabolism than men when given 10% or 40%, but not 5%, alcohol. This was associated with lower gastric x -ADH activity; its low affinity for ethanol could explain the greater gender  difference  in  first-pass  metabolism  with high  rather  than  with  low  concentrations  of  imbibed alcohol. Alcohol gastric emptying was 42% slower and hepatic oxidation was 10% higher in women. A 7.3% smaller volume of alcohol distribution contributed to the higher ethanol levels in women, but it did not account for the route-dependent effects.\n\nConclusions: The gender difference in alcohol levels is due mainly to a smaller gastric metabolism in females (because of a significantly lesser activity of x -ADH), rather than to differences in gastric emptying or  in  hepatic  oxidation of  ethanol.  The  concentration-dependency  of  these  effects  may  explain earlier discrepancies. The combined pharmacokinetic differences may increase the vulnerability of women to the effects of ethanol.",

		"abstract": "Background: Obesity-associated inflammation is characterized by an increased abundance of macrophages (MΦs) in white adipose tissue (WAT), leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins (PGs) that can cause insulin resistance. Grape powder extract (GPE) is rich in phenolic phytochemicals that possess anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\nObjective: We examined the ability of GPE to prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation in human MΦs and silence the cross-talk between human MΦs and adipocytes.\nDesign: We investigated the effect of GPE pretreatment on LPS-mediated activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and induction of inflammatory genes in human MΦs (that is, differentiated U937 cells). In addition, we determined the effect of GPE pretreatment of MΦs on inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes incubated with LPS-challenged MΦ-conditioned medium (MΦ-CM).\nMethods and Results: Pretreatment of MΦs with GPE attenuated LPS-induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β; chemokines, such as IL-8 and interferon-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10); and a marker of PG production, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Grape powder extract also attenuated LPS activation of MAPKs, NF-κB and AP-1 (c-Jun), as evidenced by decreased (1) phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38; (2) degradation of IκBα and activation of an NF-κB reporter construct; and (3) phosphorylation of c-Jun and Elk-1. Using LPS-challenged MΦ-CM, GPE pretreatment attenuated MΦ-mediated inflammatory gene expression, activation of an NF-κB reporter and suppression of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in human adipocytes.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data demonstrate that GPE attenuates LPS-mediated inflammation in MΦs, possibly by decreasing the activation of MAPKs, NF-κB and AP-1, and that GPE decreases the capacity of LPS-stimulated MΦs to inflame adipocytes and cause insulin resistance.",

		"abstract": "Many natural products exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing excessive nitric oxide (NO) production by inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol has been formerly shown to decrease nitrite generation, taken as an index for NO, but so far it was not clear which constituent of the complex flavonoid mixture mediated this effect. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the in vivo generated Pycnogenol metabolite M1 (δ-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone) displayed any activity in the context of induction of iNOS expression and excessive NO production. For the first time we show that M1 inhibited nitrite production (IC(50) 1.3 μg/ml, 95% CI 0.96-1.70) and iNOS expression (IC(50) 3.8 μg/ml, 95% CI 0.99-14.35) in a concentration-dependent fashion. This exemplifies bioactivation by metabolism because the M1 precursor molecule catechin is only weakly active. However, these effects required application of M1 in the low-micromolar range, which was not consistent with concentrations previously detected in human plasma samples after ingestion of maritime pine bark extract. Thus, we investigated a possible accumulation of M1 in cells and indeed observed high-capacity binding of this flavonoid metabolite to macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. This binding was distinctly decreased in the presence of the influx inhibitor phloretin, suggesting the contribution of a facilitated M1 transport into cells. In fact, intracellular accumulation of M1 could explain why in vivo bioactivity can be observed with nanomolar plasma concentrations that typically fail to exhibit measurable activity in vitro.",

		"abstract": "Immunomodulatory effects of alcohol use involve regulation of innate immune cell function leading to liver disease. Alteration of inflammatory responses by alcohol is linked to dysregulated TNF-α production. Alcohol-induced oxidative stress also contributes to alterations in inflammatory cell activity. Heat shock proteins (hsps) and the heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) induced by oxidative stress regulate NF-κB activation and TNF-α gene expression in monocytes and macrophages. Here, we report that in vitro alcohol treatment induced and augmented LPS-induced HSF-1 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity in monocytes and macrophages. Supershift analysis revealed that alcohol regulated HSF-1- and not HSF-2-binding activity. Hsp70, a target gene induced by HSF-1, was transiently increased within 24 h by alcohol, but extended alcohol exposure decreased hsp70 in macrophages. The alcohol-induced alteration of hsp70 correlated with a concomitant change in hsp70 promoter activity. Hsp90, another HSF-1 target gene, was decreased during short-term alcohol but increased after prolonged alcohol exposure. Decreased hsp90-HSF-1 complexes after short-term alcohol indicated dissociation of HSF-1 from hsp90. On the other hand, hsp90 interacted with client protein IκB kinase β, a signaling intermediate of the LPS pathway, followed by IκBα degradation and increased NF-κB activity after chronic alcohol exposure, indicating that hsp90 plays an important role in supporting inflammatory cytokine production. Inhibition of hsp90 using geldanamycin prevented prolonged alcohol-induced elevation in LPS-induced NF-κB and TNF-α production. These results suggest that alcohol exposure differentially regulates hsp70 and hsp90 via HSF-1 activation. Further, hsp90 regulates TNF-α production in macrophages contributing to alcohol-induced inflammation.",

		"abstract": "Background\nOverconsumption of alcohol has significant negative effects on an individual's health and contributes to an enormous economic impact on society as a whole. Pharmacotherapies to curb excessive drinking are important for treating alcohol use disorders.\n\nMethods\nTwenty (20) men participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between subjects design experiment (n=10/group) that tested the effects of kudzu extract (Alkontrol-Herbal™) for its ability to alter alcohol consumption in a natural settings laboratory. A single dose of kudzu extract (2 grams total with an active isoflavone content of 520 mg) or placebo was administered 2.5 hours before the onset of a 90 minute afternoon drinking session during which participants had the opportunity to drink up to 6 beers ad libitum; water and juice were always available as alternative beverages.\n\nResults\nDuring the baseline session, the placebo-randomized group consumed 2.7 ± 0.78 beers before treatment and increased consumption to 3.4 ± 1.1 beers after treatment. The kudzu group significantly reduced consumption from 3.0 ± 1.7 at baseline to 1.9 ± 1.3 beers after treatment. The placebo-treated group opened 33 beers during baseline conditions and 38 following treatment whereas the kudzu-treated group opened 32 beers during baseline conditions and only 21 following treatment. Additionally, kudzu-treated participants drank slower.\n\nConclusion\nThis is the first demonstration that a single dose of kudzu extract quickly reduces alcohol consumption in a binge drinking paradigm. These data add to the mounting clinical evidence that kudzu extract may be a safe and effective adjunctive pharmacotherapy for alcohol abuse and dependence.",

		"abstract": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic growth factor and immune modulator. GM-CSF also has profound effects on the functional activities of various circulating leukocytes. It is produced by a variety of cell types including T cells, macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts upon receiving immune stimuli. Although GM-CSF is produced locally, it can act in a paracrine fashion to recruit circulating neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes to enhance their functions in host defense. Recent intensive investigations are centered on the application of GM-CSF as an immune adjuvant for its ability to increase dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function as well as macrophage activity. It is used clinically to treat neutropenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, in AIDS patients during therapy, and in patients after bone marrow transplantation. Interestingly, the hematopoietic system of GM-CSF-deficient mice appears to be normal; the most significant changes are in some specific T cell responses. Although molecular cloning of GM-CSF was carried out using cDNA library of T cells and it is well known that the T cells produce GM-CSF after activation, there is a lack of systematic investigation of this cytokine in production by T cells and its effect on T cell function. In this article, we will focus mainly on the immunobiology of GM-CSF in T cells.",

		"abstract": "It is believed that drug-induced rewarding effects play an important role in the development of substance dependence. Recently, berberine was reported to inhibit the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine, morphine, and nicotine. Berberine is also demonstrated to modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems like, dopamine, nitric oxide, serotonin, and NMDA, which are implicated in rewarding effects of ethanol. Hence, we hypothesized that berberine may modulate the ethanol-induced rewarding effects. Therefore, we studied the effect of berberine on locomotor sensitization, conditioned place preference (CPP), and ethanol drinking preference in mice. The results revealed that acute administration of berberine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently reduced locomotor stimulant effect of acute ethanol and expression of sensitization to locomotor stimulant effect of ethanol. Further, pretreatment with berberine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to each dose of ethanol, blocked the development as well as expression of sensitization to locomotor stimulant effect of ethanol. In another set of experiment, treatment with berberine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the induction and expression of ethanol-induced CPP in mice. In addition, berberine in these doses also reduced preference to ethanol drinking over water, but did not alter the general reward. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that berberine attenuates ethanol-induced rewarding effects in mice and that could be attributed to its neuro-modulatory action.",

Components of the circadian clock have been shown to influence the pathophysiological effects of alcohol. Conversely, alcohol may alter the expression of circadian clock genes and the rhythmic behavioral and metabolic processes they regulate. Therefore, we propose that alcohol-mediated disruption in circadian rhythms likely underpins many adverse health effects of alcohol that cut across multiple organ systems. In this review, we provide an overview of the circadian clock mechanism and showcase results from new studies in the alcohol field implicating the circadian clock as a key target of alcohol action and toxicity in the liver. We discuss various molecular events through which alcohol may work to negatively impact circadian clock-mediated processes in the liver, and contribute to tissue pathology. Illuminating the mechanistic connections between the circadian clock and alcohol will be critical to the development of new preventative and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorders and alcohol-mediated organ diseases.",

Objectives:to describe the effects of alcohol on the CNS, identifying the signaling pathways that are modified and the biological effects resulting from its consumption.Methods:a literature review was conducted and articles published in different languages over the last 15 years were retrieved.Results:the studies reviewed describe the direct effect of alcohol on several neurotransmitter receptors (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], glutamate, endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG, among others), the indirect effect of alcohol on the limbic and opioid systems, and the effect on calcium and potassium channels and on proteins regulated by GABA in the hippocampus.Discussion and conclusion:the multiple actions of alcohol on the CNS result in a general effect of psychomotor depression, difficulties in information storage and logical reasoning and motor incoordination, in addition to stimulating the reward system, a fact that may explain the development of addiction. Knowledge on the neuronal signaling pathways that are altered by alcohol allows the identification of effectors which could reduce its central action, thus, offering new therapeutic perspectives for the rehabilitation of alcohol addicts.Keywords: alcohol-induced disorders; nervous system; neurotransmitter receptors",

		"abstract": "Induction of neuroimmune genes by binge drinking increases neuronal excitability and oxidative stress, contributing to the neurobiology of alcohol dependence and causing neurodegeneration. Ethanol exposure activates signaling pathways featuring high-mobility group box 1 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in induction of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, which regulates expression of several cytokine genes involved in innate immunity, and its target genes. This leads to persistent neuroimmune responses to ethanol that stimulate TLRs and/or certain glutamate receptors (i.e., N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors). Alcohol also alters stress responses, causing elevation of peripheral cytokines, which further sensitize neuroimmune responses to ethanol. Neuroimmune signaling and glutamate excitotoxicity are linked to alcoholic neurodegeneration. Models of alcohol abuse have identified significant frontal cortical degeneration and loss of hippocampal neurogenesis, consistent with neuroimmune activation pathology contributing to these alcohol-induced, long-lasting changes in the brain. These alcohol-induced long-lasting increases in brain neuroimmune-gene expression also may contribute to the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol affects many organs, including the immune system, with even moderate amounts of alcohol influencing immune responses. Although alcohol can alter the actions of all cell populations involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, the effect in many cases is a subclinical immunosuppression that becomes clinically relevant only after a secondary insult (e.g., bacterial or viral infection or other tissue damage). Alcohol’s specific effects on the innate immune system depend on the pattern of alcohol exposure, with acute alcohol inhibiting and chronic alcohol accelerating inflammatory responses. The proinflammatory effects of chronic alcohol play a major role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and pancreatitis, but also affect numerous other organs and tissues. In addition to promoting proinflammatory immune responses, alcohol also impairs anti-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic alcohol exposure also interferes with the normal functioning of all aspects of the adaptive immune response, including both cell-mediated and humoral responses. All of these effects enhance the susceptibility of chronic alcoholics to viral and bacterial infections and to sterile inflammation.",

		"abstract": "Chronic intake of alcohol undoubtedly overwhelms the structural and functional capacity of the liver by initiating complex pathological events characterized by steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Subsequently, these initial pathological events are sustained and ushered into a more complex and progressive liver disease, increasing the risk of fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. These coordinated pathological events mainly result from buildup of toxic metabolic derivatives of alcohol including but not limited to acetaldehyde (AA), malondialdehyde (MDA), CYP2E1-generated reactive oxygen species, alcohol-induced gut-derived lipopolysaccharide, AA/MDA protein and DNA adducts. The metabolic derivatives of alcohol together with other comorbidity factors, including hepatitis B and C viral infections, dysregulated iron metabolism, abuse of antibiotics, schistosomiasis, toxic drug metabolites, autoimmune disease and other non-specific factors, have been shown to underlie liver diseases. In view of the multiple etiology of liver diseases, attempts to delineate the mechanism by which each etiological factor causes liver disease has always proved cumbersome if not impossible. In the case of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), it is even more cumbersome and complicated as a result of the many toxic metabolic derivatives of alcohol with their varying liver-specific toxicities. In spite of all these hurdles, researchers and experts in hepatology have strived to expand knowledge and scientific discourse, particularly on ALD and its associated complications through the medium of scientific research, reviews and commentaries. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underpinning ALD, particularly those underlying toxic effects of metabolic derivatives of alcohol on parenchymal and non-parenchymal hepatic cells leading to increased risk of alcohol-induced fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis, are still incompletely elucidated. In this review, we examined published scientific findings on how alcohol and its metabolic derivatives mount cellular attack on each hepatic cell and the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to disruption of core hepatic homeostatic functions which probably set the stage for the initiation and progression of ALD to fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. We also brought to sharp focus, the complex and integrative role of transforming growth factor beta/small mothers against decapentaplegic/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling nexus as well as their cross-signaling with toll-like receptor-mediated gut-dependent signaling pathways implicated in ALD and fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis. Looking into the future, it is hoped that these deliberations may stimulate new research directions on this topic and shape not only therapeutic approaches but also models for studying ALD and fibro-hepatocarcinogenesis.",

		"abstract": "Objectives\nBoth hangover and performance deficits have been documented the day after drinking to intoxication after breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) has returned to near zero. But few studies have examined the relationship between hangover and post-intoxication performance.\n\nMethod\nWe performed secondary analyses of data from a previously reported controlled cross-over laboratory study to assess the relationship of hangover incidence and severity to sustained attention/reaction time the morning after drinking to about 0.11 g% BrAC. Relationships were investigated while controlling for gender, type of alcoholic beverage (bourbon or vodka), and neurocognitive performance after placebo.\n\nResults\nHangover severity and neurocognitive performance were significantly correlated. Participants reporting stronger hangover were more impaired than those reporting little or no hangover. Comparing any to no hangover showed a trend in the same direction of effect.\n\nConclusions\nMore intense hangover may indicate less fitness for duty in workers in certain safety-sensitive occupations, with implications for occupational alcohol policies.",

The PF and AF/Zn groups were pair-fed with the AF group. Hepatic inflammation and endotoxin signaling were determined by immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Alterations in intestinal tight junctions and aldehyde dehydrogenases were assessed by qPCR and Western blot analysis.\nResults: The AF rats had greater macrophage activation and cytokine production (P < 0.05) in the liver compared with the PF rats, whereas the AF/Zn rats showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). Plasma endotoxin concentrations of the AF rats were 136% greater than those of the PF rats, whereas the AF/Zn rats did not differ from the PF rats. Ileal permeability was 255% greater in the AF rats and 19% greater in the AF/Zn rats than in the PF rats. The AF group had reduced intestinal claudin-1, occludin, and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression, and the AF/Zn group had upregulated claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression (P < 0.05) compared with the PF group. The intestinal epithelial expression and activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases were elevated (P < 0.05) in the AF/Zn rats compared with those of the AF rats. Furthermore, the ileal expression and function of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, which was impaired in the AF group, was significantly elevated in the AF/Zn group compared with the PF group.\nConclusions: The results demonstrate that attenuating hepatic endotoxin signaling by preserving the intestinal barrier contributes to the protective effect of zinc on alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats.",

		"abstract": "Background\nAlcoholic liver disease (ALD) requires endotoxemia and is commonly associated with intestinal barrier leakiness. Using monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells as an in vitro barrier model, we showed that ethanol-induced intestinal barrier disruption is mediated by iNOS (inducible nitric-oxide synthase) upregulation, NO (nitric oxide) overproduction, and oxidation/nitration of cytoskeletal proteins. We hypothesized that iNOS inhibitors (L-NAME, L-NIL) in vivo will inhibit the above cascade and liver injury in an animal model of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH).\n\nMethods\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged daily with alcohol (6 g/kg/day) or dextrose for 10 weeks ± L-NAME, L-NIL or vehicle. Systemic and intestinal NO levels were measured by nitrites and nitrates in urine and tissue samples, oxidative damage to the intestinal mucosa by protein carbonyl and nitrotyrosine, intestinal permeability by urinary sugar tests, and liver injury by histological inflammation scores, liver fat, and myeloperoxidase activity.\n\nResults\nAlcohol caused tissue oxidation, gut leakiness, endotoxemia and ASH. L-NIL and L-NAME, but not the D-enantiomers, attenuated all steps in the alcohol-induced cascade including NO overproduction, oxidative tissue damage, gut leakiness, endotoxemia, hepatic inflammation and liver injury.\n\nConclusions\nThe mechanism we reported for alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption in vitro – NO overproduction, oxidative tissue damage, leaky gut, endotoxemia and liver injury – appears to be relevant in vivo in an animal model of alcohol-induced liver injury. That iNOS inhibitors attenuated all steps of this cascade suggests that prevention of this cascade in alcoholics will protect the liver against the injurious effects of chronic alcohol and that iNOS may be a useful target for prevention of ALD.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcohol use can result in many pathological effects including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). While alcohol is necessary for the development of ALD, only 20–30% of alcoholics develop alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) with progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis and liver failure (ALD). This suggests that while chronic alcohol consumption is necessary it is not sufficient to induce clinically relevant liver damage in the absence of a secondary risk factor. Studies in rodent models and alcoholic patients show that increased intestinal permeability to microbial products like endotoxin play a critical role in promoting liver inflammation in ALD pathogenesis. Therefore identifying mechanisms of alcohol-induced intestinal permeability is important in identifying mechanisms of ALD and for designing new avenues for therapy. Cyp2e1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes alcohol has been shown to be upregulated by chronic alcohol use and to be a major source of oxidative stress and liver injury in alcoholics and in animal and in vitro models of chronic alcohol use. Because Cyp2e1 is also expressed in the intestine and is upregulated by chronic alcohol use, we hypothesized it could play a role in alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability. Our in vitro studies with intestinal Caco-2 cells and in mice fed alcohol showed that circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2 are required for alcohol-induced permeability. We also showed that alcohol increases Cyp2e1 protein and activity but not mRNA in Caco-2 cells and that an inhibitor of oxidative stress or siRNA knockdown of Cyp2e1 prevents the increase in CLOCK or PER2 proteins and prevents alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. With our collaborators we have also shown that Cyp2e1 knockout mice are resistant to alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver inflammation. Taken together our data support a novel Cyp2e1-circadian clock protein mechanism for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new avenues for therapy of ALD.",

A close correlation between endotoxemia and the severity of alcohol-induced liver injury is supported by a number of clinical and experimental studies. Elevated intestinal permeability appears to be the major factor involved in the mechanism of alcoholic endotoxemia and the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol and its metabolic derivatives, acetaldehyde in particular, alter intracellular signal-transduction pathways leading to the disruption of epithelial tight junctions and an increase in paracellular permeability to macromolecules. Studies addressing the mechanisms of such epithelial disruption and the protective factors that prevent ethanol and acetaldehyde-mediated disruption of epithelial tight junctions are critically important in the investigations toward the search of preventive and therapeutic strategies for alcoholic liver disease.",

This resulted in elevated levels of glutathione in both liver and brain, and in a reduced hepatic rate of generation of reactive oxygen species. The depression of hepatic and cerebral glutathione levels in ethanol-consuming rats was prevented by simultaneous treatment with α-tocopherol. Other putative indices of hepatic pro-oxidant events, namely levels of mixed function oxidase and proteolytic activity, were elevated by α-tocopherol both in the presence and absence of ethanol In addition, levels of enzymes especially susceptible to oxidative degradation, glutamine synthetase and creatine kinase, were depressed in the liver following treatment with ethanol or α-tocopherol. Parameters rapidly responsive to oxidative changes revealed the antioxidant property of α-tocopherol, while protein-based indices reflecting more extended events suggested a pro-oxidant effect of this vitamin. Results suggest that high levels of α-tocopherol can simultaneously lead to a more reduced intracellular environment and yet to localized evidence of enhanced oxidative events.",

When ethanol was infused at a concentration of 24μmol/ml of blood the rate of utilization was 2.8μmol/min per g of liver. 3. Ethanol infusion raised perfusate glucose concentrations and caused a 2.5-fold increase in hepatic glucose output. 4. Final blood lactate concentrations were decreased in ethanol-infused livers, but the mean uptake of lactate from erythrocyte glycolysis was unaffected. 5. Production of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate+3-oxobutyrate) and the ratio [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[3-oxobutyrate] were raised by ethanol. 6. Formation of 3H2O from specifically 3H-labelled glucoses increased in the order [6-3H]<[3-3H]<[2-3H]. Production of 3H2O from [2-3H]glucose was significantly greater than that from [3-3H]glucose in both control and ethanol-infused livers. Ethanol significantly decreased 3H2O formation from all [3H]glucoses. 7. Liver glycogen content was unaffected by ethanol infusion. 8. Production of very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerols was inhibited by ethanol and there was a small increase in liver triacylglycerols. Very-low-density-lipoprotein secretion was negatively correlated with the ratio [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[3-oxobutyrate]. Perfusate fatty acid concentrations and molar composition were unaffected by perfusion with ethanol. 9. Ethanol decreased the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into fatty acids and cholesterol. 10. The concentration of total plasma amino acids was unchanged by ethanol, but the concentrations of alanine and glycine were decreased and ([glutamate]+[glutamine]) was raised. 11. It is proposed that the observed effects of ethanol on carbohydrate metabolism are due to an increased conversion of lactate into glucose, possibly by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The increase in gluconeogenesis is accompanied by diminished substrate cycling at glucose–glucose 6-phosphate and at fructose 6-phosphate–fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.",

		"abstract": "Aims: Chronic, excessive drinking of alcohol can induce brain damage in the regions important for neurocognitive function. Some of the damage are permanent while some are appearantly reversible. It is our aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced and/or related brain damage, particularly of that observed in ‘medically uncomplicated’ (without heptatic cirrhosis or Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome [WKS]) alcoholics. Methods: A high-throughput proteomics technology has been applied to several ‘alcohol-sensitive’ brain regions from uncomplicated and hepatic cirrhosis-complicated alcoholics to understand the mechanisms of alcohol-related brain damage at the level of protein expression. Results: It was clearly demonstrated that each brain region reacts in significantly different manner to chronic alcohol ingestion. Appearant abnormalities in vitamin B1 (thiamine)-related biochemical pathways were observed in several brain regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, genu (a frontal part of the corpus callosum) and cerebellar vermis in uncomplicated alcoholics, suggesting that the reduction of this important nutritional component might be associated with brain damage even without the signs of WKS. In addition, in the two different subregions of the corpus callosum (genu and splenium [a posterior part of the corpus callosum]) and the cerebellar vermis, significant differences in protein expression profiles between uncomplicated and complicated alcoholics with hepatic cirrhosis were identified, suggesting that hepatic factors such as ammonia have significant additive influences on brain protein expression, which might lead to the structural changes and/or damage in these brain regions. Furthermore, in the hippocampus, significant change of the level of glutamine synthetase expression was observed, suggesting once again the importance of ammonia as a cause of brain damage in this region. Conclusions: Although our data did not show any evidence of “direct” alcohol effects to induce the alteration of protein expression in association with brain damage, high-throughput neuroproteomics approaches are proven to have a potential to dissect the mechanisms of complex brain disorders.",

		"abstract": "The discovery that mammalian cells have the ability to synthesize the free radical nitric oxide (NO) has stimulated an extraordinary impetus for scientific research in all the fields of biology and medicine. Since its early description as an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, NO has emerged as a fundamental signaling device regulating virtually every critical cellular function, as well as a potent mediator of cellular damage in a wide range of conditions. Recent evidence indicates that most of the cytotoxicity attributed to NO is rather due to peroxynitrite, produced from the diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and another free radical, the superoxide anion. Peroxynitrite interacts with lipids, DNA, and proteins via direct oxidative reactions or via indirect, radical-mediated mechanisms. These reactions trigger cellular responses ranging from subtle modulations of cell signaling to overwhelming oxidative injury, committing cells to necrosis or apoptosis. In vivo, peroxynitrite generation represents a crucial pathogenic mechanism in conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, diabetes, circulatory shock, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, novel pharmacological strategies aimed at removing peroxynitrite might represent powerful therapeutic tools in the future. Evidence supporting these novel roles of NO and peroxynitrite is presented in detail in this review.",

In the present study, the effect of acetaldehyde on tyrosine phosphorylation, immmunofluorescence localization, and detergent-insoluble fractions of the tight junction and the adherens junction proteins was determined in the human colonic mucosa. The role of EGF and l-glutamine in prevention of acetaldehyde-induced effects was also evaluated. Acetaldehyde reduced the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, thereby increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. The levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin in detergent-insoluble fractions were reduced by acetaldehyde, while it increased their levels in detergent-soluble fractions. Pretreatment with EGF or l-glutamine prevented acetaldehyde-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, redistribution from intercellular junctions, and reduction in the levels of detergent-insoluble fractions of occludin, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. These results demonstrate that acetaldehyde induces tyrosine phosphorylation and disrupts tight junction and adherens junction in human colonic mucosa, which can be prevented by EGF and glutamine.",

		"abstract": "In the present study, in vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to study the labeling of brain metabolites after intravenous administration of [1-13C]ethanol. After [1-13C]ethanol was systemically administrated to the rats, 13C labels were detected in glutamate, glutamine and aspartate in the carboxylic and amide carbon spectral region. 13C-labeled bicarbonate HCO3− (161.0 ppm) was also detected. Saturating acetaldehyde C1 at 207.0 ppm was found to have no effect on the ethanol C1 (57.7 ppm) signal intensity after extensive signal averaging, providing direct in vivo evidence that direct metabolism of alcohol by brain tissue is minimal. To compare the labeling of brain metabolites by ethanol with labeling by glucose, in vivo time course data were acquired during intravenous co-infusion of [1-13C]ethanol and [13C6]-D-glucose. In contrast to labeling by [13C6]-D-glucose which produced doublets of carboxylic/amide carbons with a J coupling constant of 51 Hz, the simultaneously detected glutamate and glutamine singlets are labeled by [1-13C]ethanol. Since 13C labels originated from ethanol enter brain after being converted into [1-13C]acetate in liver and the direct metabolism of ethanol by brain tissue is negligible, it is suggested that orally or intragastrically administered 13C-labeled ethanol may be used to study brain metabolism and glutamatergic neurotransmission in studies involving alcohol administration. In vivo 13C MRS of rat brain following intragastric administration of 13C-labeled ethanol is demonstrated.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThis study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the probiotic VSL#3 in acute alcoholic intestinal injury, and evaluate the effect of VSL#3, glutamine,VSL#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL#3 therapy in a rat model.\n\nMethods\nSix- to eight-week-old male wild-type rats were divided into seven groups. To establish the acute alcohol liver disease model, rats received three doses of corn starch dissolved in PBS/40% alcohol administered intra-gastrically every 12 hours. Treatment groups received an intra-gastric dose of VSL#3, Glutamine, heat-killed VSL#3, or VSL#3+Glutamine 30 minutes prior to alcohol administration. The placebo group was treated with PBS prior to alcohol administration. TNFα and endotoxin in plasma was measured by ELISA and Tachypleus Ameboctye Lysate assays, and electron microscopy, Western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to identify the mechanisms of VSL#3 in the regulation of epithelial permeability.\n\nResults\nFirst, compared with control group, endotoxin and TNFα in alcohol group was obviously high. At the same time, in VSL#3 group,the expression of endotoxin and TNFα obviously lower than the alcohol group. And the trends of the expression of tight junction proteins in these groups were reversed with the change of endotoxin and TNFα. Second, compared the groups of VSL#3 with glutamine,VSL#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL#3,we found that both VSL#3 and heat-killed VSL#3, glutamine were as effective as VSL#3+glutamine in the treatment of acute alcohol liver disease, the expression of endotoxin and TNFα were lower than the alcohol group, and tight junction proteins were higher than the alcohol group whereas the expression of tight junction proteins were higher in VSL#3 + glutamine group than either agent alone, but have no significant difference.\n\nConclusion\nWe conclude that VSL#3 treatment can regulate the ecological balance of the gut microflora, preventing passage of endotoxin and other bacterial products from the gut lumen into the portal circulation and down-regulating the expression of TNFα, which could otherwise down-regulate the expression of tight junction proteins and increase epithelial permeability.",

		"abstract": "It is well accepted that ethanol is able to produce major health and economic problems associated to its abuse. Because of its intoxicating and addictive properties, it is necessary to analyze its effect in the central nervous system. However, we are only now learning about the mechanisms controlling the modification of important membrane proteins such as ligand-activated ion channels by ethanol. Furthermore, only recently are these effects being correlated to behavioral changes. Current studies show that the glycine receptor (GlyR) is a susceptible target for low concentrations of ethanol (5 to 100 mM). GlyRs are relevant for the effects of ethanol because they are found in the spinal cord and brain stem where they primarily express the α1 subunit. More recently, the presence of GlyRs was described in higher regions, such as the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, with a prevalence of α2/α3 subunits. Here, we review data on the following aspects of ethanol effects on GlyRs: 1) direct interaction of ethanol with amino acids in the extracellular or transmembrane domains, and indirect mechanisms through the activation of signal transduction pathways; 2) analysis of α2 and α3 subunits having different sensitivities to ethanol which allows the identification of structural requirements for ethanol modulation present in the intracellular domain and C-terminal region; 3) Genetically modified knock-in mice for α1 GlyRs that have an impaired interaction with G protein and demonstrate reduced ethanol sensitivity without changes in glycinergic transmission; and 4) GlyRs as potential therapeutic targets.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol alters the function of several members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Recent studies have shown that the sensitivity of the α1 glycine receptor (GlyR) to ethanol can be affected by the state of G protein activation mediated by the interaction of Gβγ with intracellular amino acids in the GlyR. Here, we evaluated the physicochemical property of Lys385 that contributes to ethanol modulation by using mutagenesis, patch-clamp, and biochemical techniques. A conserved substitution (K385R) did not affect either the apparent glycine EC₅₀ (40 ± 1 versus 41 ± 0.5 μM) or the ethanol-induced potentiation (53 ± 5 versus 46 ± 5%) of the human α1 GlyR. On the other hand, replacement of this residue with glutamic acid (K385E), an acidic amino acid, reduced the potentiation of the GlyR to 10 ± 1%. Furthermore, mutations with a hydrophobic leucine (K385L), a hydrogen bond donor glutamine (K385Q), or a neutral residue (K385A) also reduced ethanol modulation. Finally, substitution by a large and hydrophobic residue (K385F) and deletion of 385 (Lys385_) reduced ethanol modulation to 10 ± 4 and 17 ± 0.4%, respectively. Experiments using dynamic cysteine substitution with a methanethiosulfonate reagent and homology modeling indicate that the basic property and the position of Lys385, probably because of its interaction with Gβγ, is critical for ethanol potentiation of the receptor.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) constitute the most common form of substance abuse. The development of AUD involves repeated alcohol use leading to tolerance, alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), physical and psychological dependence, with loss of ability to control excessive drinking. Currently there is no effective therapeutic agent for AUD without major side-effects. Dihydromyricetin (DHM, 1 mg/kg, i.p. injection), a flavonoid component of herbal medicines, counteracted acute alcohol (EtOH) intoxication, and also withdrawal signs in rats including tolerance, increased anxiety and seizure susceptibility; DHM greatly reduced EtOH consumption in an intermittent voluntary EtOH intake paradigm in rats. GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are major targets of acute and chronic EtOH actions on the brain. At the cellular levels, DHM (1 μM) antagonized both acute EtOH-induced potentiation of GABAARs and EtOH exposure/withdrawal-induced GABAAR plasticity, including alterations in responsiveness of extra- and post-synaptic GABAARs to acute EtOH, and most importantly, increases in GABAAR α4 subunit expression in hippocampus and cultured neurons. DHM anti-alcohol effects on both behavior and CNS neurons were antagonized by flumazenil (10 mg/kg in vivo, 10 μM in vitro), the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist. DHM competitively inhibited BZ-site [3H]flunitrazepam binding (IC50, 4.36 μM), suggesting DHM interaction with EtOH involves the BZ-sites on GABAARs. In summary, we determined DHM anti-alcoholic effects on animal models, and determined a major molecular target and cellular mechanism of DHM for counteracting alcohol intoxication and dependence. We demonstrated pharmacological properties of DHM consistent with those expected to underlie successful medical treatment of AUD; therefore DHM is a therapeutic candidate.",

Of\n28 rats weighing 341±22g at baseline, 15 were assigned to the EtOH group\nand 13 to the control (Ctrl) group.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes of\nthe lateral ventricles and cisterns showed enlargement with each binge EtOH\nexposure but recovery with each abstinence period. Similarly, changes to MRS\nmetabolites were transient: levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and total\ncreatine (tCr) decreased, while those of choline-containing compounds (Cho) and\nglutamate/glutamine (Glx) increased with each binge EtOH exposure cycle, but\nalso recovered during each abstinence period.

		"abstract": "Background: High alcohol consumption is a major cause of morbidity, yet alcohol is associated with both favourable and adverse effects on cardiometabolic risk markers. We aimed to characterize the associations of usual alcohol consumption with a comprehensive systemic metabolite profile in young adults., Methods: Cross-sectional associations of alcohol intake with 86 metabolic measures were assessed for 9778 individuals from three population-based cohorts from Finland (age 24–45 years, 52% women). Metabolic changes associated with change in alcohol intake during 6-year follow-up were further examined for 1466 individuals. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaires. Circulating lipids, fatty acids and metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays., Results: Increased alcohol intake was associated with cardiometabolic risk markers across multiple metabolic pathways, including higher lipid concentrations in HDL subclasses and smaller LDL particle size, increased proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, lower concentrations of glutamine and citrate (P < 0.001 for 56 metabolic measures). Many metabolic biomarkers displayed U-shaped associations with alcohol consumption. Results were coherent for men and women, consistent across the three cohorts and similar if adjusting for body mass index, smoking and physical activity. The metabolic changes accompanying change in alcohol intake during follow-up resembled the cross-sectional association pattern (R2 = 0.83, slope = 0.72 ± 0.04)., Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is associated with a complex metabolic signature, including aberrations in multiple biomarkers for elevated cardiometabolic risk. The metabolic signature tracks with long-term changes in alcohol consumption. These results elucidate the double-edged effects of alcohol on cardiovascular risk.",

		"abstract": "Objective\nMetabolomics is a promising approach to the identification of biomarkers in plasma. Here, we performed a population-based, cross-sectional study to identify potential biomarkers of alcohol intake and alcohol-induced liver injury by metabolomic profiling using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS).\n\nMethods\nFasting plasma samples were collected from 896 Japanese men who participated in the baseline survey of the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study, and 115 polar metabolites were identified and absolutely quantified by CE-MS. Information on daily ethanol intake was collected through a standardized, self-administered questionnaire. The associations between ethanol intake and plasma concentration of metabolites were examined. Relationships between metabolite concentrations or their ratios and serum liver enzyme levels in the highest ethanol intake group (>46.0 g/day) were then examined by linear regression analysis. Replication analysis was conducted in 193 samples collected from independent population of this cohort.\n\nResults\nNineteen metabolites were identified to have an association with daily alcohol consumption both in the original and replication population. Three of these metabolites (threonine, glutamine, and guanidinosuccinate) were found to associate well with elevated levels of serum liver enzymes in the highest ethanol intake group, but not in the non-drinker group. We also found that the glutamate/glutamine ratio had a much stronger relation to serum γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase than glutamate or glutamine alone (standardized beta = 0.678, 0.558, 0.498, respectively).\n\nConclusions\nWe found 19 metabolites associated with alcohol intake, and three biomarker candidates (threonine, guanidinosuccinate and glutamine) of alcohol-induced liver injury. Glutamate/glutamine ratio might also be good biomarker.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12199-015-0494-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

In this study, 20 healthy men who were all social drinkers drank alcohol (2.2 g/kg) in controlled circumstances on a Saturday evening. Ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) values were compared with ABPM values of the same subjects during the previous sober Saturday, separately throughout 6 hours of intoxication, throughout 6 hours when blood alcohol levels decreased, and throughout 6 hangover hours. During the intoxication period, both mean systolic BP and mean diastolic BP were 5 mm Hg higher (P=0.0183 and P=0.0529, respectively) and the pulse was 18 beats per minute faster (P=0.0001) compared with the corresponding sober period during the previous weekend. While blood alcohol levels decreased after drinking, mean systolic BP was 4 mm Hg lower (P=0.0331), diastolic BP was 5 mm Hg lower (P=0.0058), and pulse was 15 bpm faster (P=0.0001) than during the sober weekend. No statistically significant difference was found between the weekends in BP values during the hangover period. Drinking seems to increase both systolic and diastolic BP during intoxication but not during hangover. During the period when blood alcohol levels are decreasing, usually at night, both pressure levels fall to less than the basic level. These major and rapid changes in BP values might increase the likelihood of strokes, which are seen in increased numbers among young adults, especially during weekends and holidays.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMeasures of hangover are associated with current and future problematic alcohol use. At present, it is not known whether these associations reflect any direct influence of hangover events on near-term drinking behaviors. The current study aimed to determine whether hangover following a drinking episode influences time to next drink (TTND), and, if so, to determine the direction of this effect and identify any moderating personal or contextual factors.\n\nMETHODS\nCommunity-recruited, frequent drinkers oversampled for current smoking (N=386) carried electronic diaries for 21 days, reporting on drinking behaviors and other experiences. Survival analysis was used to model data from 2,276 drinking episodes, including 463 episodes that were followed by self-reported hangover in morning diary entries.\n\nRESULTS\nWhen tested as the sole predictor in a survival model, hangover was associated with increased TTND. The median survival time was approximately 6 hours longer after episodes with hangovers compared to those without. In a multivariate model, hangover was only significant in the presence of interaction effects involving craving at the end of the index drinking episode and the occurrence of financial stressors. Additional predictors of TTND in the final multivariate model included age, lifetime alcohol use disorder diagnosis, typical drinking frequency, day of the week, and morning reports of craving, negative affect, and stressors after the index episode. There was no association between morning reports of hangover and contemporaneous diary ratings of likelihood of drinking later the same day.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that hangover has, at best, a modest or inconsistent influence on the timing of subsequent alcohol use among frequent drinkers.",

		"abstract": "The effects of a preparation of combined glutathione-enriched yeast (GEY) and rice embryo/soybean (RES) extracts (20:1), GEY/RES, on experimentally induced ethanol hangover were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. To evaluate the preventive effects on hangover, rats were orally administered GEY/RES (50/2.5, 100/5, or 200/10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At 30 minutes after the final treatment, they were challenged with 3 mL/kg ethanol (15 mL of 20% in water/kg). The blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde were analyzed up to 7 hours postchallenge. Hepatic mRNA expression levels of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 type 2E1 (CYP2E1), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additional rats were challenged with ethanol and, 60 minutes later, administered GEY/RES to evaluate alcohol clearance. Pretreatment with GEY/RES for 2 weeks reduced the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde in a dose-dependent manner, lowering by 29.5% and 54.6% at the highest dose (200/10 mg/kg), respectively. The expressions of mRNAs for ADH and ALDH, the major alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, were markedly increased in the livers of rats administered GEY/RES for 2 weeks, whereas CYP2E1 mRNA was suppressed. Postchallenge treatment with GEY/RES enhanced the alcohol clearance rate by lowering blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde by 24% and 26.6%, respectively, for the highest dose group. GEY/RES remarkably eliminated 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate radical and FeCl(3)-mediated lipid peroxidation in vitro and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation following ethanol administration in vivo. Therefore, it is suggested that GEY/RES reduces the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde not only by modulating alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, but also by exerting its antioxidant activity, and that GEY/RES could be a promising candidate for improvements of alcoholic hangover.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate intake of different alcoholic beverages on these markers, including carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), sialic acid (SA), and the liver enzymes γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Methods:  Eleven apparently healthy, nonsmoking middle-aged men were included in a 12-week randomized, diet-controlled crossover trial according to a 4 × 4 Latin-square design. Changes in CDT, SA, γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were analyzed after 3 weeks of daily intake of four glasses (40 g of alcohol) of red wine, beer, spirits (Dutch gin), or water (control). Results:  After 3 weeks’ daily consumption of red wine, a significant decrease of serum CDT concentration was observed compared with water consumption. There was no effect of any alcoholic beverage on the other outcome measures. Conclusions:  Daily consumption of 40 g of alcohol from different types of alcoholic beverages with dinner did not affect SA or liver enzymes. Further investigations to explore the mechanisms for the red wine–induced decreases of CDT, including changes in iron metabolism, are clearly needed.",

		"abstract": "Penthorum chinense Pursh (Penthoraceae) has been used as a Miao ethnomedicine for the treatment of jaundice, cholecystitis, edema, infectious hepatitis and anti-drunk hangover in China. The aim of present study is to investigate the possible protective effects of Penthorum chinense against chronic ethanol-induced liver injury. Mice were fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin as control diet with or without aqueous extract of Penthorum chinense (PCP, 5.15 and 10.30g/kg/BW) for 4 weeks. Silymarin (86mg/kg) was used as positive control to compare the efficacy of PCP against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Treatment with PCP (10.30g/kg) significantly reduced the increases in serum ALT and AST levels, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-6), which were induced by chronic ethanol exposure. PCP was also found to attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, restore the glutathione (GSH) depletion, and increase the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. In addition, PCP supplementation (10.30g/kg) inhibited the induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), a major contributor to ethanol-mediated oxidative stress, and up-regulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream anti-oxidant protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ethanol-treated mice. These results indicate that the co-treatment with aqueous extract of Penthorum chinense (10.30g/kg) protects against chronic ethanol-induced liver injury, possibly through suppressing CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and enhancing the oxidant defense systems via the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

		"abstract": "Quantitative analysis of plasma phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) is an important step in evaluating the biochemical processes leading to oxidative injury. However, secondary products of lipid peroxidation are now used as indices. One hundred nine alcoholic patients, aged 22–81 years (mean ± SEM, 52.0 ± 1.3 years), and 21 healthy volunteers, aged 41–79 years (51.2 ± 2.2 years), participated in this study. Plasma PCOOH was measured by HPLC with chemiluminescence detection. Plasma PCOOH concentration was significantly higher in alcoholic patients (46.1 ± 4.1 pmol/ml) than in controls (15.6 ± 1.8 pmol/ml). It was significantly higher in patients with blood alcohol (88.0 ± 10.5 pmol/ml) than in those without alcohol (32.6 ± 3.1 pmol/ml). The patients with high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), and triglyceride (TG) showed significantly higher PCOOH concentrations than did patients with normal levels. The PCOOH level was positively correlated with levels of γ-GTP, HDL, blood alcohol concentration, and TG. Plasma PCOOH levels in 29 alcoholic patients after a 6 week abstinence were decreased significantly (22.8 ± 11.1 pmol/ml), which was associated with improvement on liver function tests. This is the first measurement of plasma PCOOH in alcoholic patients.\nThese results suggest the involvement of lipid peroxidation in alcohol-induced liver damage and confirm that the PCOOH plasma concentration is a new marker of alcohol consumption as well as oxidative stress in alcoholic patients.",

N-terminal amino acid sequence of GF-AS showed NH2-Val-Ala-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Ala-Gly-Phe-Ala-Leu-Ser-Leu-Glx-Pro-Pro-Ala-Gly-Tyr-. GF-AS significantly increases the activities of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase, microsomal ethanol metabolizing system, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in rats acutely treated with alcohol, resulting in decreased plasma alcohol levels. GF-AS also increases the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione level. Markers of liver injury induced by alcohol: elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride and cholesterol, are reduced by GF-AS in both acutely and chronically treated rats. The activities of lipogenic enzymes including malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphoglucuronic acid dehydrogenase in chronic alcohol-treated rats are significantly decreased by GF-AS. Furthemore, GF-AS improves histological change in fatty liver and hepatic lesions induced by alcohol. Collectively, GF-AS may alleviate alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity through increasing ethanol and lipid metabolism, as well as antioxidant defense systems in livers injured by acute- and chronic-alcohol treatment.",

To assess the effect on tHcy according to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T genotype., Design and methods: A randomized controlled crossover intervention study measuring tHcy and serum folate and vitamin B12 concentrations was conducted in 78 male subjects (21–70 years). Following a 2-week washout period during which no alcohol was consumed, all subjects consumed 24 g alcohol (either 240 ml red wine or 80 ml vodka)/day for a 2-week period. Following a further 2-week washout, participants consumed the alternate intervention for 2 weeks., Results: A significant increase in plasma tHcy was observed after the 2-week red wine intervention (5%, P = 0.03), and a non-significant increase in tHcy with vodka intervention (3%, P = 0.09). When the two interventions were compared, the change in tHcy did not differ between the vodka and red wine interventions (P = 0.57). There were significant decreases in serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations, and this decrease did not differ between interventions. The increase in tHcy observed in both interventions did not vary by MTHFR 677C>T genotype., Conclusions: A 2-week alcohol intervention resulted in a decrease in folate and vitamin B12 status and an increase in plasma tHcy.

		"abstract": "AIM: Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive oxidant synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO may cause injury through the generation of potent radicals. Nw- nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) is a non-selective inhibitor of NOS. We aimed to evaluate whether L-NAME treatment had protective effects against oxidative stress in rats intragastrically fed with ethanol during a 4 wk-period., METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into 3 equal groups: group 1 (control group-isocaloric dextrose was given), group 2 (6 g/kg·d ethanol-induced group) and group 3 (both ethanol 6 g/kg·d and L-NAME 500 mg/L in drinking water-given group). Animals were sacrificed at the end of 4 wk-experimental period, and intracardiac blood and liver tissues were obtained. Biochemical measurements were performed both in plasma and in homogenized liver tissues. Alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), NO, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by spectrophotometry., RESULTS: ALT and AST in group 2 (62 U/L and 128 U/L, respectively) were higher than those in group 1 (24 U/L and 38 U/L) and group 3 (37 U/L and 81 U/L) (P<0.001 for both). Plasma and tissue levels of MDA in group 2 (4.66 μmol/L and 0.55 nmol/mg protein) were higher than in group 1 (2.65 μmol/L and 0.34 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (3.43 μmol/L and 0.36 nmol/mg protein) (P<0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue levels of NO in group 2 (54.67 μmol/L and 586.50 nmol/mg protein) were higher than in group 1 (34.67 μmol/L and 435.33 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (27.50 μmol/L and 412.75 nmol/mg protein ) (P<0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue SOD activities in group 2 (15.25 U/mL and 5.38 U/ mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (20.00 U/mL and 8.13 U/ mg protein) and group 3 (19.00 U/mL and 6.93 U/ mg protein) (P<0.001 for both). Plasma and liver tissue CAT activities in group 2 (145 U/mL and 37 U/ mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (176 U/mL and 73 U/mg protein) and group 3 (167 U/mL and 61 U/mg protein) (P<0.001 for both). Meanwhile, erythrocytes and liver tissue levels of GSH in group 2 (4.12 mg/g Hb and 5.38 nmol/mg protein, respectively) were lower than in group 1 (5.52 mg/g Hb and 4.49 nmol/mg protein) and group 3 (5.64 mg/g Hb and 4.18 nmol/mg protein) (P<0.001 for both)., CONCLUSION: Our findings show that L-NAME may produce a restorative effect on ethanol-induced liver damage via decreasing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant status.",

		"abstract": "Effects of Bacillus natto-fermented product (BIOZYME) on blood alcohol and aldehyde concentrations after drinking whisky (corresponding to 30-65 ml ethanol) were studied in 21 healthy volunteers. When 100 ml of BIOZYME was orally administrated to the volunteers before drinking whisky, the time delay of both blood factors to attain maximum concentrations were observed. The maximum decrease in blood alcohol and aldehyde concentrations were about 23% and 45% (p < 0.005), respectively, at 1 hr after drinking whisky. The aldehyde lowering effect of BIOZYME was continued for at least 4 hr after whisky drinking. Concentration of the breath alcohol was also sharply decreased by BIOZYME administration. The breath alcohol concentration in the administered group (0.18 +/- 0.11 mg/l) was found to be lowered about 44% than that of the control group (0.32 +/- 0.11 mg/l) (p < 0.0005, n = 21), at 1 hr after drinking whisky. In acute toxicity experiments of aldehyde in mice (12 mmol AcH/mg), BIOZYME showed the survival effect as with alpha-D-Ala (134% increase of the living, at 40 min after i.p. administration) (p < 0.005, n = 22). These findings reveal the Bacillus natto produced BIOZYME as a reasonable, safety and useful anti-hangover agent.",

Heavy drinkers, non-flushers of B (ethanol: 176 g, 2.5 g/kg), C (157 g, 2.4 g/kg) and E (182 g, 2.9 g/kg) had a slightly high [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio and 3-hydroxybutyrate in the blood at 11 hr after alcohol ingestion.

B, C and E had a high urine acetone concentration (100 microM over) in hangover. In C, in particular, urine acetate and acetone levels were unusually high. The ratio in blood (urine) among alcohol metabolites at 9 hr after drinking was approximately ethanol 1000 (1000): acetaldehyde 0.2-1.0 (0.1-5.9): acetate 36-163 (22-1554): acetone 1-11 (3-47).",

		"abstract": "Chronic inflammation is often associated with alcohol-related medical conditions. The key inducer of such inflammation, and also the best understood, is gut microflora-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Alcohol can significantly increase the translocation of LPS from the gut. In healthy individuals, the adverse effects of LPS are kept in check by the actions and interactions of multiple organs. The liver plays a central role in detoxifying LPS and producing a balanced cytokine milieu. The central nervous system contributes to anti-inflammatory regulation through neuroimmunoendocrine actions. Chronic alcohol use impairs not only gut and liver functions, but also multi-organ interactions, leading to persistent systemic inflammation and ultimately, to organ damage. The study of these interactions may provide potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

This review addresses the effect of alcohol consumption on the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Although data are limited in humans, studies highlight the importance of changes in the intestinal microbiota in alcohol-related disorders. Alcohol-induced changes in the GIT microbiota composition and metabolic function may contribute to the well-established link between alcohol-induced oxidative stress, intestinal hyperpermeability to luminal bacterial products, and the subsequent development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), as well as other diseases. In addition, clinical and preclinical data suggest that alcohol-related disorders are associated with quantitative and qualitative dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiota and may be associated with increased GIT inflammation, intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and tissue damage/organ pathologies including ALD. Thus, gut-directed interventions, such as probiotic and synbiotic modulation of the intestinal microbiota, should be considered and evaluated for prevention and treatment of alcohol-associated pathologies.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol abuse is a significant contributor to the global burden of disease and can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction in a subset of alcoholics. However, a subset of alcoholics without any of these predisposing factors can develop alcohol-mediated organ injury. The gastrointestinal tract (GI) could be an important source of inflammation in alcohol-mediated organ damage. The purpose of review was to evaluate mechanisms of alcohol-induced endotoxemia (including dysbiosis and gut leakiness), and highlight the predisposing factors for alcohol-induced dysbiosis and gut leakiness to endotoxins. Barriers, including immunologic, physical, and biochemical can regulate the passage of toxins into the portal and systemic circulation. In addition, a host of environmental interactions including those influenced by circadian rhythms can impact alcohol-induced organ pathology. There appears to be a role for therapeutic measures to mitigate alcohol-induced organ damage by normalizing intestinal dysbiosis and/or improving intestinal barrier integrity. Ultimately, the inflammatory process that drives progression into organ damage from alcohol appears to be multifactorial. Understanding the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease can pose further avenues for pathogenic and treatment approaches.",

		"abstract": "Excessive alcohol consumption can induce oxidative stress, resulting in the development of several diseases. Exercise has been reported to prevent and/or improve a number of health issues through several mechanisms, including an improvement in redox status. It has also been previously suggested that exercise can help individuals with alcohol use disorders reduce their alcohol intake; however, research in this field is limited. The aim of the present study was to investigage the effects of acute exercise of moderate intensity on the liver function and blood redox status in heavy drinkers. For this purpose, a total of 17 heavy drinkers [age, 31.6±3.2 years; body mass index (BMI), 27.4±0.8 kg/m(2); experimental group (EG)] and 17 controls [age, 33.5±1.3 years; BMI, 26.1±1.4 kg/m(2); control group (CG), who did not exceed moderate alcohol consumption], underwent one trial of acute exercise of moderate intensity (50-60% of the heart rate reserve) for 30 min on a cycle ergometer, following an overnight fast, and abstaining from smoking and alcohol consumption. Blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise for later determination of the indices of liver function and blood redox status. The subjects in the EG had significantly higher (p<0.05) baseline γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels compared to the subjects in the CG. Exercise thus resulted in significantly higher γ-GT levels (p<0.005) only in the EG. No significant differences in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) baseline levels were observed between the 2 groups. Following exercise, the AST levels increased significantly (p<0.001) in both groups, whereas the ALT levels increased significantly (p<0.01) only in the EG. The baseline glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly lower (p<0.05) and remained low following exercise in the EG. In addition, we observed a trend for higher (p=0.07) baseline levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), which remained elevated post-exercise in the EG compared to the CG. Significantly increased post-exercise total antioxidant capacity (TAC; p<0.01) and uric acid (UA; p<0.05) levels were noted in the CG, whereas the TAC (p=0.06) and UA (p=0.08) levels increased and approached significance post-exercise in the EG. No significant differences in the baseline levels of total bilirubin and protein carbonyl were observed between the 2 groups, even post-exercise. Thus, the findings of the present study indicate that even though heavy drinkers may be prone to oxidative stress, their exercise-induced antioxidant response is similar to that of individuals who do not drink heavily.",

		"abstract": "Acute and/or chronic alcohol ingestion has been shown to exacerbate the morbidity and mortality rate associated with acute mechanical and/or thermal trauma. While alcohol ingestion can affect many organs and systems, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that alcohol ingestion can cause a ‘leaky gut’ syndrome which in turn contributes to infection and systemic organ dysfunction. This study investigated the acute effect of alcohol on gut barrier function. Using an in vivo isolated gut sac model of naïve male rats, each individual gut sac was injected with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40%, v/v) of alcohol. After different times of alcohol exposure, each isolated gut segment was harvested and intestinal permeability and mucosal surface hydrophobicity (a physiologic marker of mucus barrier function) were measured as well as luminal DNA, mucus, protein and free fatty acids. The results showed that alcohol caused dose-dependent and time-dependent increases in gut permeability and decreases in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, with significant changes to be observed 5 min after treatment with 10% alcohol. In addition, it is further found that these changes in permeability and hydrophobicity are more closely associated with increased intestinal luminal free fatty acids levels but not protein or DNA levels. These results suggest that alcohol may cause loss of gut barrier function by extracting and dissolving lipids from the mucus with a resultant decrease in mucosal surface hydrophobicity, which is a critical component of gut barrier function.",

		"abstract": "Binge drinking, the most common form of alcohol consumption, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity; yet, its biological consequences are poorly defined. Previous studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol use results in increased gut permeability and increased serum endotoxin levels that contribute to many of the biological effects of chronic alcohol, including alcoholic liver disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of acute binge drinking in healthy adults on serum endotoxin levels. We found that acute alcohol binge resulted in a rapid increase in serum endotoxin and 16S rDNA, a marker of bacterial translocation from the gut. Compared to men, women had higher blood alcohol and circulating endotoxin levels. In addition, alcohol binge caused a prolonged increase in acute phase protein levels in the systemic circulation. The biological significance of the in vivo endotoxin elevation was underscored by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, and chemokine, MCP-1, measured in total blood after in vitro lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Our findings indicate that even a single alcohol binge results in increased serum endotoxin levels likely due to translocation of gut bacterial products and disturbs innate immune responses that can contribute to the deleterious effects of binge drinking.",

		"abstract": "Background\nAlcohol is a significant component of the diet with dose-dependent risks and benefits. High doses of alcohol damage the liver and early symptoms of liver disease include changes in routinely assessed liver enzymes. Less is known regarding the mechanisms responsible for the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, including their effects on the liver. The objectives of this study were to examine alcohol’s dose-dependent effects on markers of liver function (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin), as well as to compare the different methods of assessing alcohol intake using NHANES 2001–2010 adult data (N = 24,807).\n\nMethods\nThree methods were used to estimate alcohol intake from all volunteers: 24-h recall; the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method of usual intake; and a specific alcohol intake questionnaire.\n\nResults\nMean alcohol intake by 24-h recall, NCI method and questionnaire was 41.0 ± 0.8 g/d, 10.9 ± 0.2 g/d and 11.0 ± 0.2 g/d, respectively. Alcohol consumers had significantly lower levels of ALP and higher levels of AST, GGT and bilirubin compared to non-consumers (P < 0.01) and activities of ALT, AST, and GGT increased and of ALP decreased as alcohol intake increased, regardless of intake assessment method used. The most sensitive measure of alcohol consumption was GGT.\n\nConclusions\nSince alcohol had a graded linear effect on several liver enzymes, including at low and moderate doses, benefits as well as risks of alcohol intake may be related to liver function. Since the NCI method and alcohol questionnaire yielded very similar alcohol intake estimates, this study cross-validated these methods and demonstrated the robustness of the NCI method for estimating intake of irregularly consumed foods.",

		"abstract": "Condensation reactions between some SH-amino acids (L-and D-cysteine 1%) and acetaldehyde (50 microM) were studied in vitro experiment. In the aqueous solution, free acetaldehyde was reduced to 41.3% by L-cysteine and to 36.4% by D-cysteine. In the reaction with human blood medium, after the medium was deproteinized with perchloric acid reagent, acetaldehyde was reduced to 47.0% by L-cysteine and to 43.8% by D-cysteine. D-Cysteine appears to have great stability of reacting acetaldehyde. In vitro experiment reactability for D-cysteine exhibited 3-8% higher than that for L-cysteine. Next, effects of some amino acids on alcohol metabolism were studied in male ICR mice. The animals were given ethanol through a gastric catheter at a dose of 2 g/kg and they were intraperitoneally injected L-cysteine (300 mg/kg), D-cysteine (300 mg/kg), L-alanine (300 mg/kg) and control (saline), respectively in the period of one hour before the injection of ethanol. Blood and tissues samples were analyzed for ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetate and acetone during alcohol intoxication in mice by head space gas chromatography. In the groups administered D-cysteine and L-cysteine, the mice showed a definitely faster oxidation and disappearance of ethanol. Especially in the D-cysteine group, ethanol levels in blood, liver and brain remained lower than that in the other groups (p less than 0.01). Acetaldehyde levels in blood, liver and brain remained low by L-cysteine. Ethanol metabolites during alcohol oxidation by chemical reactabilities of L- and D-cysteine showed different distribution in the mice, respectively. In the mice received L-alanine, acetate and acetone levels in blood, liver and brain were distinctly reduced (p less than 0.01). L-Alanine is reported to supply an abundance of pyruvic acid that performs the NAD-generating system. NAD produced is introduced to alcohol metabolism and the TCA cycle. It was thus presumed that the L- or/and D-cysteine, and L-alanine was effective in acute alcohol intoxication by heavy drinking.",

		"abstract": "Objective:\nThe misuse of alcohol, even at levels just above two drinks per day, is a public health problem, but identifying patients with this potentially unhealthy drinking is hindered by the lack of tests. Several blood tests, such as those testing for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or mean corpuscular volume (MCV), are among the commonly used markers to identify very heavy drinking, but combinations of these markers have rarely been tested in lighter drinkers. We examined the relationship between alcohol drinking and the levels of these markers in a national population-based study composed primarily of lighter drinkers.\n\nMethod:\nData were analyzed from 8,708 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey after excluding subjects with iron overload; with hepatitis B and C; who were pregnant; and who were taking prescription drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), barbiturates, and hydroxyurea (Droxia and Hydrea). The relationship between the amount of alcohol drinking and GGT, aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio, MCV of erythrocytes, and apolipoprotein A1 and B were analyzed and adjusted for potential liver injury risk factors.\n\nResults:\nThe prevalence of unhealthy alcohol drinking (defined as consumption of more than two standard drinks per day) was 6.7%. Heavier drinkers tended to be younger and reported an average of 4.2 drinks per day. When tested alone or in combination, the sensitivity and positive predictive values for these blood tests were too low to be clinically useful in identifying the subjects in the heavier drinking category.\n\nConclusions:\nIn this large, national, population-based study, the markers of heavy drinking studied here, either alone or in combination, did not appear to be useful in identifying unhealthy drinking. More work is needed to find the novel marker(s) associated with risky alcohol drinking.",

		"abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) following acute alcohol intoxication can increase proinflammatory cytokine production and induce marked immunosuppression. We investigated the effects of ethanol on physiopathology and cytokine levels following HS in acutely alcohol-intoxicated rats. Rats received an intravenous injection of 5 g/kg ethanol over 3 h followed by HS induced by withdrawal of 40% of total blood volume from a femoral arterial catheter over 30 min. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously for 48 h after the start of blood withdrawal. Biochemical parameters, including hemoglobin, ethanol, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), were measured at 30 min before induction of HS and 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h after HS. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured at 1 and 12 h after HS. The liver, kidneys, and lungs were removed for pathology at 48 h later. HS significantly increased HR, blood GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels and decreased hemoglobin and MAP in rats. Acute ethanol intoxication further increased serum levels of GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, TNF-α and IL-6 elevation following HS. Acutely intoxicated rats exacerbated the histopathologic changes in the liver, kidneys, and lungs following HS.",

		"abstract": "Event-related potential (ERP) is a reliable neuroelectric measure of brain activity that helps to confirm the assessment of mental status and cognitive impairment. Many studies have reported that alcoholics show a significantly lower ERP P300 amplitude than the norm. In the present study, ERP P300 waves were measured to evaluate the effect of citric acid on cognitive function during excessive alcohol consumption in healthy adults. Five volunteers were selected through clinical interview, physical examination, and psychiatric assessment for participation in this study. In a double-blind placebo-controlled before-after design, each subject was treated with 5 ml/kg body weight alcohol, 5 ml/kg body weight alcohol and 1 mg citric acid, or a placebo on three separate occasions, one week apart. ERP P300, blood biochemical indicators, blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and acetaldehyde concentrations were assessed. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a within-subjects factor was used to evaluate differences in blood biochemical indicators, BACs, blood acetaldehyde concentrations, and ERP P300 in the three sessions of assessments. Several blood biochemical indicators showed significant differences between treatments, including the levels of cholinesterase (CHE), total bile acid (TBA), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and glycylproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (GPDA). BACs after consumption of alcohol alone or citric acid with alcohol were significantly higher compared to those after placebo treatment (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in blood acetaldehyde concentrations between the treatments. The P300 amplitudes on the frontal (Fz), central (Cz), and parietal (Pz) regions of the scalp after consumption of alcohol were significantly lower than those after consumption of the placebo or citric acid with alcohol (P<0.05), while there were no significant differences between the latter two treatments. The results of this study suggest that citric acid could reduce the decline in ERP P300 amplitude and cognitive ability induced by acute alcohol consumption. It may also affect some blood biochemical indicators, but the specific mechanisms need further research.",

		"abstract": "Background\nIsoflavone administration in the form of a purified extract from the herbal medication kudzu root has been shown to reduce, but not eliminate, alcohol consumption in alcohol-abusing and alcohol-dependent men. The precise mechanism of this action is unknown, but one possible explanation for these results is that the isoflavones in kudzu might actually increase the intensity or duration of alcohol’s effects and thus delay the desire for subsequent drinks. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.\n\nMethods\nTwelve (12) healthy adult men and women (27.5±1.89 yrs old) who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol (7.8±0.63 drinks/week) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which they were treated with either kudzu extract (total isoflavone dose of 750 mg/day) or matched placebo for nine days. On days 8 and 9, participants received an acute challenge of ethyl alcohol (either 0.35 or 0.7 g/kg alcohol). During the challenges the following measures were collected: subjective effects, psychomotor (body sway), cognitive performance (vigilance/reaction time), physiological measures (heart rate and skin temperature), and plasma ethanol concentration.\n\nResults\nAlcohol resulted in a dose-related alteration in subjective measures of intoxication, impairment of stance stability, and vigilance/reaction time. Kudzu extract did not alter participants’ subjective responses to the alcohol challenge or to alcohol’s effects on stance stability or vigilance/reaction time. However, individuals treated with kudzu extract experienced a slightly more rapid rise in plasma ethanol levels, but only after the 0.7 g/kg dose. This transient effect during the first 30 minutes of the ascending plasma alcohol curve lasted only 10-15 minutes; there were no differences in peak plasma alcohol levels or alcohol elimination kinetics. Additionally, kudzu pretreatment enhanced the effects of the 0.7 g/kg dose of alcohol on heart rate and skin temperature.\n\nConclusions\nThese data suggest that individuals who drink alcohol while being treated with kudzu extract experience no adverse consequences and further, the reported reductions in alcohol intake after kudzu extract treatment are not related to an alteration in alcohol’s subjective or psychomotor effects.",

		"abstract": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of beverages containing fermented Akebia quinata extracts on alcoholic hangover. For this study, 25 healthy young men were recruited. All participants consumed 100 mL of water (placebo), commercial hangover beverage A or B, fermented A. quinata leaf (AQL) or fruit (AQF) extract before alcohol consumption. After 1 h, all participants consumed a bottle of Soju, Korean distilled liquor (360 mL), containing 20% alcohol. Blood was collected at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h after alcohol consumption. The plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was highest in the placebo group. Compared with the control group, the AQL and AQF groups showed decreased ALT activity at 5 h after alcohol consumption. Plasma ethanol concentration was increased after alcohol intake and peaked at 3 h after alcohol consumption. Compared with the control group, the A group showed a higher plasma ethanol concentration at 1 h (P<0.05). At 3 h after alcohol consumption, the AQF group showed the lowest mean plasma ethanol concentration compared to the other groups; however, there were no statistical differences. After 5 h of alcohol consumption, the AQL and AQF groups showed lower plasma ethanol concentrations compared with the B group. The sensory evaluation score for the fermented A. quinata fruit extract was lower than for the commercial hangover beverages. In conclusion, the present intervention study results suggest that fermented A. quinata extracts alleviate alcoholic hangover and reduce plasma ethanol concentrations.",

(40%), Lycium chinense L. (30%), Inonotus obliquus (20%), and Acanthopanax senticosus H. (10%). We recruited healthy, nonsmoking, adult men volunteers aged between 21 years and 30 years to participate in a crossover trial. Twenty participants received either one package of placebo with 200 mL water or DTS20 with 200 mL water. Thirty minutes later, the volunteers ingested one bottle of Soju, which is a commercially available liquor (19% alcohol in 360 mL).\n\nResults\nVolunteers received the opposite treatment after a 1-week washout period. DTS20 is mainly composed of sugars (564.5 mg/g) and polyphenol (28.2 mg/g). Alcohol levels in the DTS20 group were significantly lower than the control group at 2 hours after drinking Soju (p < 0.05). Acetaldehyde levels in the DTS20 group tended to be lower than the control group at 2 hours after drinking Soju, but was not significantly different. The antioxidant activity level was also significantly different between the control and DTS20 group 2 hours after drinking Soju (p < 0.05). No differences in plasma alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels were observed between plasma levels before drinking and 2 hours after drinking Soju in the control group.\n\nConclusion\nIt was concluded that DTS20 reduced oxidative stress and hangover by mitigating plasma alcohol concentrations and elevating antioxidative activity in healthy male adults.",

		"abstract": "Background\nLittle is known about the effects of dietary components on the regulation of the gastric emptying rate of alcohol and its impact on alcohol metabolism. We recently found that the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers from several types of botanical foods maintained aqueous ethanol solutions. Additionally, the ethanol-absorbing ability of the dietary fibers correlated with the inhibition of the blood ethanol elevation by delaying gastric emptying. Moreover, we found that the synergism between tomatoes and alanine to reduce the absorption of alcohol in rats was attributable to the effect of alanine on precipitates, such as the crude water-insoluble dietary fibers of tomatoes. In the present study, we assess whether an alanine-fortified tomato (AFT) is effective in relieving acute alcohol-induced adverse effects by lowering the alcohol action in healthy human volunteers following the ingestion of alcohol with a meal.\n\nMethods\nTwenty healthy males ingested the AFT or sugar as the control, with 1.2 g/kg of alcohol and a micronutrient-fortified meal in a randomized cross-over study. Breath alcohol concentrations were temporally measured, and blood and urine samples were obtained during the trial. The study protocol was repeated with the AFT and sugar groups reversed 4 weeks later.\n\nResults\nVarious analyses were performed using the data from the 15 subjects. The breath alcohol concentrations significantly decreased when AFT was ingested. A decrease in the urinary pH was also noted following the ingestion of AFT. Moreover, the sum of seven sedative scores as subjective sensation after alcohol ingestion was significantly reduced by AFT the next morning.\n\nConclusions\nOur study demonstrates that the simultaneous ingestion of AFT under the consumption of excess alcohol and a micronutrient-fortified meal relieved the acute alcohol-induced adverse effects in male volunteers. These results are consistent with the effectiveness observed in rats as previously reported.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThe pre-drinking mood state has been indicated to be an important factor in the mood effects of alcohol. However, for moderate alcohol consumption there are no controlled studies showing this association. Also, the mood effects of consuming alcohol combined with food are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol combined with a meal on ambiance-induced mood states. Furthermore effects on autonomic nervous system activity were measured to explore physiological mechanisms that may be involved in changes of mood state.\n\nMethods\nIn a crossover design 28 women (age 18–45 y, BMI 18.5–27 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to 4 conditions in which they received 3 glasses of sparkling white wine (30 g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine while having dinner in a room with either a pleasant or unpleasant created ambiance. Subjects filled out questionnaires (B-BAES, POMS and postprandial wellness questionnaire) at different times. Skin conductance and heart rate variability were measured continuously.\n\nResults\nModerate alcohol consumption increased happiness scores in the unpleasant, but not in the pleasant ambiance. Alcohol consumption increased happiness and stimulation feelings within 1 hour and increased sedative feelings and sleepiness for 2.5 hour. Skin conductance was increased after alcohol within 1 hour and was related to happiness and stimulation scores. Heart rate variability was decreased after alcohol for 2 hours and was related to mental alertness.\n\nConclusion\nMood inductions and autonomic nervous system parameters may be useful to evaluate mood changes by nutritional interventions. Moderate alcohol consumption elevates happiness scores in an unpleasant ambiance. However, drinking alcohol during a pleasant mood results in an equally positive mood state.\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT01426022.",

The early identification of alcohol abuse could increase the possibility of a favorable treatment outcome and reduce health care costs. Many biochemical laboratory markers of alcohol abuse have been used for several years, but each of them has clinical limitations. Recently, sialic acid (SA) has been suggested as a new potential marker of excessive alcohol consumption. In this paper, the general characteristic of SA has been given including the usefulness in the identifying of alcohol abuse. The clinical studies showed that serum and saliva sialic acid concentration was significantly higher in female and male alcoholics compared to social drinkers. It has been established also, that the serum SA level in male alcoholics was significantly increased after a short period of relapse to heavy alcohol drinking. In addition, the serum SA level was significantly decreased during an alcoholism treatment and abstinence. Sialic acid seems to be interesting biochemical marker of alcohol abuse (detecting, monitoring) with the diagnostic efficiency as good as, or even better, than the traditional markers used today.",

		"abstract": "We examined the effects of l-ornithine administration on physical fatigue. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study, 17 healthy volunteers were randomized to l-ornithine (2000 mg/d for 7 days and 6000 mg/d for 1 day as l-ornithine hydrochloride) or placebo for 8 days. The fatigue-inducing physical task consisted of workload trials on a cycle ergometer at fixed workloads for 2 hours on 2 occasions. We found that oral l-ornithine administration promoted lipid metabolism and activated the urea cycle from serum triacylglycerol, ketone bodies, free fatty acids, and blood ammonia level changing. l-ornithine significantly attenuated the subjective feeling of fatigue (measured by visual analog scale at postrecovery) compared with postload (P < .01). Moreover, in female subjects, the subjective feeling of fatigue was significantly lower compared with the placebo group (P < .05). In the physical performance test in female subjects, the decrease in mean speed for 10 seconds maximum pedaling from 0.5- to 3.5-hour trials in the group receiving l-ornithine was smaller than that in the group receiving placebo (P < .05). These results suggest that l-ornithine has an antifatigue effect by increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and promoting the excretion of ammonia. l-ornithine is a free amino acid and is not rich in meats or fish, so it is difficult to obtain amounts of l-ornithine from ordinary meals that would be sufficient to promote the antifatigue effect. We recommend l-ornithine intake as a nutritional supplement in cases of physical fatigue.",

		"abstract": "Background\nResidual alcohol effects on physiological and psychological symptoms are commonly experienced the morning after alcohol consumption. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of L-ornithine on subjective feelings and salivary stress markers the morning after alcohol consumption and to investigate whether L-ornithine acutely accelerates ethanol metabolism.\n\nMethods\nThis study had a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover design. Subjects were all healthy Japanese adults with the ‘flusher’ phenotype for alcohol tolerance. In experiment 1, 11 subjects drank 0.4 g/kg body weight alcohol 1.5 h before their usual bedtime. Half an hour after drinking, they ingested either a placebo or 400 mg ornithine. The next morning on awakening, subjects completed a questionnaire containing a visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), and a profile of mood states (POMS) and collected a saliva sample for measurement of salivary stress markers (cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A, and α-amylase). In experiment 2, placebo or 400 mg ornithine were administrated to 16 subjects both before and after drinking, and the feeling of drunkenness, breath ethanol concentration and one-leg standing time were repeatedly investigated until 180 min after alcohol consumption.\n\nResults\nThere were significant decreases in “awareness”, “feeling of fatigue” and “lassitude” VAS scores and in “anger-hostility” and “confusion” POMS scores and a significant increase in “sleep length” in the OSA-MA test. Salivary cortisol concentrations on awakening were reduced after ornithine supplementation. There were no differences between ornithine and placebo in any of the subjective or physiological parameters of acute alcohol metabolism.\n\nConclusions\nTaking 400 mg ornithine after alcohol consumption improved various negative feelings and decreased the salivary stress marker cortisol the next morning. These effects were not caused by an increase in acute alcohol metabolism.",

How far has neuroscience progressed in this endeavor? This Perspective assesses progress in elucidating five basic brain processes: visual recognition, long-term memory, short-term memory, action selection, and motor control. Each of these processes entails several levels of analysis: the behavioral properties, the underlying computational algorithm, and the cellular/network mechanisms that implement that algorithm. At this juncture, while many questions remain unanswered, achievements in several areas of research have made it possible to relate specific properties of brain networks to cognitive functions. What has been learned reveals, at least in rough outline, how cognitive processes can be an emergent property of neurons and their connections.",

		"page": "270–293",
		"volume": "1621",
		"abstract": "This article provides an overview of neural models of synaptic learning and memory whose expression in adaptive behavior depends critically on the circuits and systems in which the synapses are embedded. It reviews Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, models that use excitatory matching and match-based learning to achieve fast category learning and whose learned memories are dynamically stabilized by top-down expectations, attentional focusing, and memory search. ART clarifies mechanistic relationships between consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. ART models are embedded in ARTSCAN architectures that unify processes of invariant object category learning, recognition, spatial and object attention, predictive remapping, and eye movement search, and that clarify how conscious object vision and recognition may fail during perceptual crowding and parietal neglect. The generality of learned categories depends upon a vigilance process that is regulated by acetylcholine via the nucleus basalis. Vigilance can get stuck at too high or too low values, thereby causing learning problems in autism and medial temporal amnesia. Similar synaptic learning laws support qualitatively different behaviors: Invariant object category learning in the inferotemporal cortex; learning of grid cells and place cells in the entorhinal and hippocampal cortices during spatial navigation; and learning of time cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal system during adaptively timed conditioning, including trace conditioning. Spatial and temporal processes through the medial and lateral entorhinal-hippocampal system seem to be carried out with homologous circuit designs. Variations of a shared laminar neocortical circuit design have modeled 3D vision, speech perception, and cognitive working memory and learning. A complementary kind of inhibitory matching and mismatch learning controls movement.",

		"abstract": "A full understanding of consciousness requires that we identify the brain processes from which conscious experiences emerge. What are these processes, and what is their utility in supporting successful adaptive behaviors? Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) predicted a functional link between processes of Consciousness, Learning, Expectation, Attention, Resonance and Synchrony (CLEARS), including the prediction that \"all conscious states are resonant states\". This connection clarifies how brain dynamics enable a behaving individual to autonomously adapt in real time to a rapidly changing world. The present article reviews theoretical considerations that predicted these functional links, how they work, and some of the rapidly growing body of behavioral and brain data that have provided support for these predictions. The article also summarizes ART models that predict functional roles for identified cells in laminar thalamocortical circuits, including the six layered neocortical circuits and their interactions with specific primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific nuclei. These predictions include explanations of how slow perceptual learning can occur without conscious awareness, and why oscillation frequencies in the lower layers of neocortex are sometimes slower beta oscillations, rather than the higher-frequency gamma oscillations that occur more frequently in superficial cortical layers. ART traces these properties to the existence of intracortical feedback loops, and to reset mechanisms whereby thalamocortical mismatches use circuits such as the one from specific thalamic nuclei to nonspecific thalamic nuclei and then to layer 4 of neocortical areas via layers 1-to-5-to-6-to-4. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For supervised learning, biased ARTMAP (bARTMAP) solves the problem of over-emphasis on early critical features by directing attention away from previously attended features after the system makes a predictive error. Small-scale, hand-computed analog and binary examples illustrate key model dynamics. Two-dimensional simulation examples demonstrate the evolution of bARTMAP memories as they are learned online. Benchmark simulations show that featural biasing also improves performance on large-scale examples. One example, which predicts movie genres and is based, in part, on the Netflix Prize database, was developed for this project. Both first principles and consistent performance improvements on all simulation studies suggest that featural biasing should be incorporated by default in all ARTMAP systems.

		"abstract": "Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, is a cognitive and neural theory of how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. This article reviews classical and recent developments of ART, and provides a synthesis of concepts, principles, mechanisms, architectures, and the interdisciplinary data bases that they have helped to explain and predict. The review illustrates that ART is currently the most highly developed cognitive and neural theory available, with the broadest explanatory and predictive range. Central to ART's predictive power is its ability to carry out fast, incremental, and stable unsupervised and supervised learning in response to a changing world. ART specifies mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony during both unsupervised and supervised learning. ART provides functional and mechanistic explanations of such diverse topics as laminar cortical circuitry; invariant object and scenic gist learning and recognition; prototype, surface, and boundary attention; gamma and beta oscillations; learning of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells; computation of homologous spatial and temporal mechanisms in the entorhinal-hippocampal system; vigilance breakdowns during autism and medial temporal amnesia; cognitive-emotional interactions that focus attention on valued objects in an adaptively timed way; item-order-rank working memories and learned list chunks for the planning and control of sequences of linguistic, spatial, and motor information; conscious speech percepts that are influenced by future context; auditory streaming in noise during source segregation; and speaker normalization. Brain regions that are functionally described include visual and auditory neocortex; specific and nonspecific thalamic nuclei; inferotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, hippocampal, parahippocampal, perirhinal, and motor cortices; frontal eye fields; supplementary eye fields; amygdala; basal ganglia: cerebellum; and superior colliculus. Due to the complementary organization of the brain, ART does not describe many spatial and motor behaviors whose matching and learning laws differ from those of ART. ART algorithms for engineering and technology are listed, as are comparisons with other types of models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Among the members of the mitochondrial carrier family, there are transporters that catalyze the translocation of ornithine and related substrates, such as arginine, homoarginine, lysine, histidine, and citrulline, across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial carriers ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 from Homo sapiens, BAC1 and BAC2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Ort1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been biochemically characterized by transport assays in liposomes. All of them transport ornithine and amino acids with side chains terminating at least with one amine. There are, however, marked differences in their substrate specificities including their affinity for ornithine (KM values in the mM to μM range). These differences are most likely reflected by minor differences in the substrate binding sites of these carriers. The physiological role of the above-mentioned mitochondrial carriers is to link several metabolic pathways that take place partly in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondrial matrix and to provide basic amino acids for mitochondrial translation. In the liver, human ORC1 catalyzes the citrulline/ornithine exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is required for the urea cycle. Human ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis and transport of arginine, which can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of NO, agmatine, polyamines, creatine, glutamine, glutamate, and proline, as well as in the degradation of basic amino acids. BAC1 and BAC2 are implicated in some processes similar to those of their human counterparts and in nitrogen and amino acid metabolism linked to stress conditions and the development of plants. Ort1p is involved in the biosynthesis of arginine and polyamines in yeast.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine, decarboxylated arginine, is produced in the kidney and can increase nephron and kidney filtration rate via renal vasodilatation and increases in plasma flow. This increase in filtration rate after agmatine is prevented by administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. In endothelial cells, agmatine-stimulated nitrite production is accompanied by induction of cytosolic calcium. NOS activity requires calcium for activation; however, the source of this calcium remains unknown. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium-activated calcium release channels are present in the kidney cortex, and we evaluated if RyR contributes to the agmatine response. Agmatine microperfused into Bowman's space reversibly increases nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) by ∼30%. cADP-ribose (cADPR) regulates RyR channel activity. Concurrent infusion of agmatine with the cADPR blocker 8-bromo-cADPR (2 μM) prevents the increase in filtration rate. Furthermore, direct activation of the RyR channel with ryanodine at agonist concentrations (5 μM) increases SNGFR, and, like agmatine, this increase is prevented by administration of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nonselective NOS blocker. We demonstrate that agmatine does not elicit ADPR cyclase activity in vascular smooth muscle membranes and does not directly affect RyR calcium channel responses using sea urchin egg homogenates. These results imply interplay between endothelial cell cADPR/RyR/Ca2+/NO and the cADPR/RyR/Ca2+ pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells in arterioles in the regulation of kidney filtration rate. In conclusion, we show that agmatine-induced effects require activation of cADPR and RyR calcium release channels for NO generation, vasodilation, and increased filtration rate.",

		"abstract": "The present study investigated the effect of agmatine on acquisition and expression of ethanol conditioned place preference (CPP) and its modulation by imidazoline agents. Swiss albino mice were treated intraperitoneally with saline or agmatine (20-40 mg/kg) before injection of ethanol (1.25 mg/kg) during conditioning days or on a test day (20-120 mg/kg), to observe the effect on acquisition or expression of CPP, respectively. Agmatine inhibited the acquisition but not the expression of ethanol CPP. Furthermore, both the I₁ receptor antagonist, efaroxan (9 mg/kg) and the I₂ receptor antagonist, BU224 (5 mg/kg) attenuated the agmatine-induced inhibition of the ethanol CPP acquisition. In contrast, the I₂ receptor agonist, 2-BFI (5 mg/kg) and I₁ receptor agonist, moxonidine (0.4 mg/kg) alone, or a combination of their subeffective doses, significantly attenuated the effect of agmatine (20 mg/kg) on acquisition of ethanol CPP. Agmatine or imidazoline agents alone produced neither place preference nor aversion, and at the doses used in the present study did not affect locomotor activity. Thus, agmatine attenuates the acquisition of ethanol CPP at least in part by imidazoline (I₁ or I₂) receptors. In future studies, agmatine or agents acting at the imidazoline receptors could be explored for their therapeutic potential in ethanol dependence.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine (CAS 2482-00-0), an amine formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine, interacts with several targets like alpha2-adrenergic, imidazoline and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and besides it is involved in the nitric oxide mediated effects. It has also been proposed that it possesses vasodilator effects and increases glomerular filtration rate in rats. The aim of this study was to supply evidence for the effects of agmatine in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock and explain the possible mechanisms of action. The iliac arteries and veins of Sprague-Dawley rats were catheterized under urethane anesthesia and around 2 ml/100 g blood was withdrawn within 20 min until the mean arterial blood pressure was stabilized around 25 mmHg. The rats were either pretreated with physiological saline, yohimbine (an alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or L-arginine (a nitric oxide donor) intravenously before administration of agmatine (300 microg/kg). Agmatine restored blood pressure in rats pretreated with physiological saline where all rats survived. Pretreatment with L-arginine abolished the increase in blood pressure produced by agmatine and the 1 h survival rate decreased to 67% (p < 0.01). Yohimbine pretreatment also suppressed agmatine induced restoration of blood pressure; however, the survival rate was found to be 17% for 3 min. No statistically significant effect was observed in the heart rate responses. These results may suggest that agmatine may increase survival through alpha2-adrenergic receptors and restores blood pressure through nitric oxide and adrenergic mechanisms in rats bled to hemorrhage.",

Therefore, we tested its influence against cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats using Morris water maze and object recognition paradigm. Lipid peroxidation and glutathione levels as parameters of oxidative stress and choline esterase (ChE) activity as a marker of cholinergic function were assessed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Thirty days after diabetes induction rats showed a severe deficit in learning and memory associated with increased lipid peroxidation, decreased reduced glutathione, and elevated ChE activity. In contrast, chronic treatment with agmatine (5-10mg/kg, i.p. for 30 days) improved cognitive performance, lowered hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and ChE activity in diabetic rats. Further, memory improving effects of agmatine were independent of adrenal I(2) imidazoline receptors. In a separate set, agmatine treatment for an initial 15 days after diabetes confirmation also significantly reduced memory impairment during training trials after 30 days of diabetes confirmation. Moreover, treatment during training trials (30 days after diabetes) also significantly reduced memory impairment in diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that treatment with agmatine prevents changes in oxidative stress and ChE activity, and probably consequent memory impairment in diabetic rats.",

		"abstract": "Regulation of agmatine homeostasis has so far only been poorly defined. In the present study, three mechanisms regulating human agmatine homeostasis were investigated. 1) Enzymatic regulation: expression of arginine decarboxylase, diamine oxidase, and ornithine decarboxylase in human colon neoplastic tissue was, at the mRNA level, about 75% and 50% lower and 150% higher, respectively, than in the adjacent normal tissue; expression of agmatinase was unchanged. 2) Bacteria-derived agmatine: ten representative bacteria strains of the human intestinal microbiota considerably differed in agmatine production and its efflux into their surrounding fluid, suggesting that the composition of the intestinal microbiota influences the agmatine availability in the gut lumen for absorption. 3) Regulation of blood plasma agmatine concentration by the human liver: at low concentrations in portal venous blood plasma, agmatine either slightly increased or further decreased in blood plasma through liver passage. Above a threshold of 14 ng/ml agmatine in the portal venous blood plasma, substantial hepatic agmatine removal from blood occurred. Taken together, a perturbation of agmatine homeostasis has been proven to be involved in the regulation of malignant cell proliferation. The amount of agmatine available for absorption, which is an important physiological source of agmatine in the human organism, should differ considerably depending on the composition of the bacterial flora in the chyme since the various species of intestinal bacteria largely differ in their ability to form agmatine. Finally, evidence has been presented that the liver plays a crucial physiological role in the maintenance of agmatine homeostasis in the human organism.",

		"abstract": "The diamine agmatine may serve as a precursor in polyamine synthesis. In addition, agmatine may also act as a neurotransmitter, binding to imidazoline receptors. Behaviorally, agmatine exerts antidepressant-like effects. The enzyme agmatinase degrades agmatine. The gene coding for human agmatinase is located on chromosome 1p36, a gene locus which has been linked to bipolar disorder and major depression, but the enzyme has not yet been studied in the context of neuropsychiatric diseases. We analyzed agmatinase protein expression in postmortem hippocampi of individuals with affective disorders. Data from eleven patients with mood disorders (unipolar and bipolar depression) and twelve matched control cases were compared by immunocytochemical and morphometrical analysis. Agmatinase protein was detected in a subset of hippocampal interneurons. The protein was localized to perikarya, neurites and putative nerve endings contacting hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. The number and the numerical density of agmatinase-immunopositive cell bodies were strongly elevated in depressive patients. In addition, a significantly increased density of agmatinase-immunoreactive punctate profiles was observed in the CA(4) region in unipolar and bipolar depression. The reported increased expression of agmatinase suggests a functional relevance of the enzyme in the pathophysiology of human affective disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.",

		"abstract": "The question of whether agmatine crosses the blood-brain barrier has not been directly addressed, even though peripheral injection of this compound has produced behavioral responses in drug withdrawal, antidepressant, and anti-anxiety paradigms. Two models were used in this investigation. In the first, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with agmatine (10, 50, or 300 mg/kg body weight) or arginine (600 mg/kg). After 1 or 3 hours, the animals were killed under gas anesthesia by perfusing their brains with ice-cold saline, and whole-brain agmatine was measured by HPLC. In parallel studies, a rhesus monkey was injected under gas anesthesia either intravenously (i.v.) with agmatine (30 mg/kg) or arginine (150 mg/kg), or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with agmatine (0.3 mg/kg i.c.v.). At varying times thereafter, cisterna magna cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma were collected and analyzed for agmatine levels. A rise in mouse brain agmatine was apparent after doses of 50 and 300 mg/kg i.p. Monkey CSF agmatine peaked in parallel with plasma agmatine 15 minutes following intravenous (i.v.) agmatine injection and at one sixth the level of the plasma peak. Monkey CSF agmatine peaked 43 minutes after i.v. arginine injection. The ventricular injection of agmatine resulted in a threefold sustained rise in blood plasma agmatine for at least 24 hours after injection. Therefore, agmatine and its precursor, arginine, cross the blood-brain barrier. CSF agmatine may be newly synthesized from peripherally injected arginine.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine is an amine formed by the decarboxylation of l-arginine by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase. The fact that exogenous agmatine modulates morphine analgesia and dependence raises the question of whether the biosynthesis of endogenous agmatine is regulated during chronic pain. As a first step to understand the biological role of agmatine in human neurological and psychiatric conditions, this study was aimed to determine the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) agmatine in normal individuals. The levels of agmatine in the CSF and blood were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Samples of CSF and blood were collected from a total of 10 participants for this study. The CSF agmatine levels ranged from 24.3 to 54.0 ng/mL, whereas the plasma agmatine levels were from 8.4 to 65.1 ng/mL. The mean values with standard error for blood and CSF agmatine were 33.8 +/- 16.6 and 40.4 +/- 9.1, respectively. The statistical analysis of these 10 samples indicated no correlation between blood and CSF samples (r = .29); however, removing one outlier improved the correlation (r = .6). From this study, the authors conclude that human CSF agmatine levels can be measured by HPLC with precision and that a possible correlation exists between plasma and CSF agmatine levels. This study provides basis for future studies in human chronic pain conditions.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The biophysiology of the amino acid l-arginine has been a field of active research. Agmatine, which is a metabolite of l-arginine, is known to participate in many biophysical reactions, including those in the cardiovascular system. We sought to investigate plasma agmatine levels in human subjects as a potential biomarker for the metabolic syndrome.\nMETHODS: Agmatine concentration was measured in plasma from 322 elderly participants in the Ansan Geriatric study. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to an Asian modified version of criteria established in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. We observed that the metabolic syndrome was associated with low levels of plasma agmatine concentration.\nRESULTS: The mean plasma agmatine level in the metabolic syndrome group was lower than that in the non-metabolic syndrome group (79.42 ng/mL vs. 82.44 ng/mL, P = 0.024). Agmatine remained significant within the regression model after adjustment for different covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 0.962; 95% confidence interval, 0.933-0.993).\nCONCLUSIONS: We concluded that plasma agmatine levels were lower in subjects with the metabolic syndrome than in those without the metabolic syndrome.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine is a biogenic amine with the capacity to regulate a number of nonreceptor-mediated functions in mammalian cells, including intracellular polyamine content and nitric oxide generation. We observed avid incorporation of agmatine into several mammalian cell lines and herein characterize agmatine transport in mammalian cells. In transformed NIH/3T3 cells, agmatine uptake is energy dependent with a saturable component indicative of carrier-mediated transport. Transport displays an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.5 μM and a maximal velocity of 280 pmol · min−1 · mg−1 protein and requires a membrane potential across the plasma membrane for uptake. Competition with polyamines, but not cationic molecules that utilize the y+ system transporter, suppresses agmatine uptake. Altering polyamine transporter activity results in parallel changes in polyamine and agmatine uptake. Furthermore, agmatine uptake is abrogated in a polyamine transport-deficient human carcinoma cell line. These lines of evidence demonstrate that agmatine utilizes, and is dependent on, the polyamine transporter for cellular uptake. The fact that this transport system is associated with proliferation could be of consequence to the antiproliferative effects of agmatine.",

		"abstract": "Endogenous polyamines like spermine are known to have four distinct effects on recombinant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels: voltage-dependent inhibition, glycine-dependent stimulation, glycine-independent stimulation and decreased affinity to the agonist (l-glutamate). These effects are highly dependent on the constituting epsilon subunits (epsilon1-epsilon4) of the recombinant NMDA receptor channels. Agmatine reportedly inhibits native NMDA receptor channels in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the present investigation, the effects of agmatine on the epsilon/zeta heteromeric NMDA receptor channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were examined using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Agmatine inhibited the four epsilon/zeta (epsilon1/zeta1, epsilon2/zeta1, epsilon3/zeta1 and epsilon4/zeta1) channels with similar sensitivity (an IC50 value of about 300microM at -70mV). This effect was dependent on the membrane potential and was more pronounced at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (voltage-dependent inhibition). Agmatine did not exhibit other stimulatory (glycine-dependent and -independent effects) or inhibitory (decreased affinity to l-glutamate) effects. These properties are similar to the pharmacological profile of well-characterized NMDA receptor channel blockers like phencyclidine and ketamine. Thus, regarding the effects on the NMDA receptor channels, agmatine is not like other endogenous polyamines rather it acts as a channel blocker.",

		"abstract": "This study examined the effects of binge-like ethanol (ETOH) exposure in neonatal rats on a cerebellar-mediated balance task, and the ability of agmatine, an n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator, to reverse such effects. Five neonatal treatments groups were used, including ETOH (6.0 g/kg/day), AG (20 mg/kg), ETOH plus AG (6.0 g/kg/day and 20 mg/kg), a maltose control, and a non-treated control. Ethanol was administered via oral intubation twice daily for eight days, (AG was administered with the last ETOH intubation only). Two exposure periods were used; PND 1–8 or PND 8–15. On PND 31–33, balance performance on a single dowel was tested. Treatment with AG during withdrawal in ETOH exposed animals improved performance relative to ETOH alone among the PND 1–8 exposure period. ETOH exposure during the 2nd postnatal week did not impair balance. These findings provide further support that exposure to ETOH during critical developmental periods can impair performance on a cerebellar-dependent balance task. Of perhaps greater significance, co-administration of agmatine reduced these deficits suggesting that NMDA modulation via polyamine blockade may provide a novel approach to attenuating damage associated with binge-like ETOH consumption.",

Present study investigated the role of agmatine and imidazoline receptors in antidepressant like effect of SSRIs and imipramine in mouse forced swimming test (FST) paradigm. The antidepressant like effect of fluoxetine or paroxetine was potentiated by imidazoline I(1)/I(2) receptor agonist agmatine (5-10 mg/kg, ip), imidazoline I(1) receptor agonists, moxonidine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, ip) and clonidine (0.015-0.03 mg/kg, ip), imidazoline I(2) receptor agonist, 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (5-10 mg/kg, ip) as well as by the drugs known to increase endogenous agmatine levels in brain viz., L-arginine, an agmatine biosynthetic precursor (40 microg/mouse, icv), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethyl ornithine (12.5 microg/mouse, icv), diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (6.5 microg/mouse, icv) and agmatinase inhibitor, arcaine (50 microg/mouse, icv). Conversely, prior administration of I(1) receptor antagonist, efaroxan (1 mg/kg, ip), I(2) receptor antagonist, idazoxan (0.25 mg/kg, ip) and arginine decarboxylase inhibitor, d-arginine (100 mg/kg, ip) blocked the antidepressant like effect of paroxetine (10 mg/kg, ip) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, ip). On the other hand, antidepressant like effect of imipramine was neither augmented nor attenuated by any of the above drugs. Mice pretreated with SSRIs but not imipramine and exposed to FST showed higher concentration of agmatine in brain as compared to saline control. This effect of SSRIs on agmatine levels was completely blocked by arginine decarboxylase inhibitor d-arginine but not by imidazoline receptor antagonists, efaroxan or idazoxan. These results demonstrate that modulation of imidazoline receptors by agmatine are implicated in the antidepressant like effect of SSRIs and may be projected as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine [2-(4-aminobutyl)guanidine] is an endogenous amine proposed as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator that binds to multiple target receptors in brain. Besides, many central and peripheral functions, agmatine have been implicated in the process of drug addiction. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of centrally injected agmatine on nicotine induced locomotor sensitization in Swiss male mice. Our data shows that repeated injections of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, sc, twice daily for 7 days) gradually increased locomotion during 7 days development period or after 3 days (nicotine) withdrawal phase challenged with nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, sc) on day 11. Mice were pretreated with agmatine (40-80 microg, icv) or agents known to increase endogenous brain agmatine levels [e.g. an agmatine biosynthetic precursor, L-arginine (80 microg, icv), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethyl-ornithine (50 microg, icv), diamine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (25 microg, icv) and agmatinase inhibitor, arcaine (50 microg, icv)] 30 min before daily first nicotine injection or during nicotine withdrawal phase. All these treatments attenuated the development as well as incubation of locomotor sensitization to nicotine. Coadministration of agmatine (20 microg, icv) and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors agonist, clonidine (0.1 microg, icv) evoked synergistic inhibition of nicotine sensitization. Conversely, prior administration of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (5mg/kg, ip) or idazoxan (0.4 mg/kg, ip) reversed the inhibitory effect of agmatine on nicotine sensitization. There was no significant difference in activity between mice injected with any of these agents/saline alone and saline/saline groups. These data indicate that agmatine attenuates nicotine induced locomotor sensitization via a mechanism which may involve alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. Thus, agmatine might have therapeutic implications in the treatment of nicotine addiction and deserve further investigations.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of agmatine on brain apoptosis, astrogliosis and edema in the rats with transient cerebral ischemia.MethodsFollowing surgical induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min, agmatine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 5 min after beginning of reperfusion and again once daily for the next 3 post-operative days. Four days after reperfusion, both motor and proprioception functions were assessed and then all rats were sacrificed for determination of brain infarct volume (2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), apoptosis (TUNEL staining), edema (both cerebral water content and amounts of aquaporin-4 positive cells), gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-positive cells), and neurotoxicity (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS] expression).ResultsThe results showed that agmatine treatment was found to accelerate recovery of motor (from 55 degrees to 62 degrees) and proprioception (from 54% maximal possible effect to 10% maximal possible effect) deficits and to prevent brain infarction (from 370 mm3 to 50 mm3), gliosis (from 80 GFAP-positive cells to 30 GFAP-positive cells), edema (cerebral water contents decreased from 82.5% to 79.4%; AQP4 positive cells decreased from 140 to 84 per section), apoptosis (neuronal apoptotic cells decreased from 100 to 20 per section), and neurotoxicity (iNOS expression cells decreased from 64 to 7 per section) during MCAO ischemic injury in rats.ConclusionsThe data suggest that agmatine may improve outcomes of transient cerebral ischemia in rats by reducing brain apoptosis, astrogliosis and edema.",

		"abstract": "To better understand the neuroprotective actions of agmatine in ischemic insults, its effects on astrocytes were investigated using an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. After primary culture, cortical astrocytes were moved into a closed anaerobic chamber and incubated in glucose-free culture media. 4 h later, the cells were restored to normoxic conditions and supplied with glucose for 20 h. The ability of agmatine to rescue astrocytes from OGD only and OGD followed by restoration (OGD-R) was assessed. Cell viability was monitored with or without 100 muM agmatine, using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and annexin V flow cytometric assay. For morphological analysis, Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide double nuclear staining was performed. Expression and phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family proteins were also investigated by immunoblotting. Results showed that astrocytes had decreased viability following OGD and OGD-R and that agmatine treatment increased cell viability and induced NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus. Finally, our studies revealed that agmatine can rescue astrocytes from death caused by ischemic and/or ischemic-perfusion neuronal injuries in vitro. Our findings provide new insights that may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce these kinds of neuronal injuries.",

		"abstract": "It is established that agmatine, an endogenously formed decarboxylated arginine, is a weak competitive inhibitor of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) with an apparent K i value of 660 μM [Biochem J 316:247–249, 1996]. Although agmatine is known to bind to α-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors, it has been suggested that some of the pharmacological actions of agmatine, such as the prevention of morphine tolerance, may be due to the inhibition of nNOS. In the current study, we have discovered that agmatine, at concentrations much lower than the reported K i value, leads to a time-, concentration-, NADPH-, and calmodulin-dependent irreversible inactivation of nNOS. The kinetics of inactivation could be described by an apparent dissociation constant for the initial reversible complex (K i) and a pseudo first-order inactivation constant (k inact) of 29 μM and 0.01 min−1, respectively. As determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, the mechanism of inactivation involves alteration of the prosthetic heme moiety of nNOS, in part to protein-bound products. Moreover, we discovered that agmatine causes a 3-fold increase in the NADPH oxidase activity of nNOS leading to the production of H2O2 and is a likely cause for the inactivation of the enzyme. Both the inactivation of nNOS and the oxidative stress produced should now be considered in the pharmacological actions of agmatine as well as provide insight into the potential biological effects of endogenously formed agmatine.",

		"abstract": "Relapse and neurodegeneration are two of the major therapeutic targets in alcoholism. Fortuitously, the roles of glutamate/NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in withdrawal, conditioning and neurotoxicity mean that NMDAR inhibitors are potentially valuable for both targets. Preclinical studies further suggest that inhibitory modulators that specifically reduce the co-agonist effects of polyamines on NMDARs are potential non-toxic medications. Using agmatine as a lead compound, over 1000 novel compounds based loosely on this structure were synthesized using feedback from a molecular screen. A novel series of aryliminoguanidines with appropriate NMDAR activity in the molecular screen were discovered (US patent application filed 2007). The most potent and selective aryliminoguanidine, JR 220 [4- (chlorobenzylidenamino)- guanidine hydrochloride], has now been tested in a screening hierarchy for anti-relapse and neuroprotective activity, ranging from cell-based assay, through tissue culture to animal behavior. This hierarchy has been validated using drugs with known, or potential, clinical value at these targets (acamprosate (N-acetyl homotaurine), memantine and topiramate). JR220 was non-toxic and showed excellent activity in every screen with a potency 5-200x that of the FDA-approved anti-relapse agent, acamprosate. This chapter will present a review of the background and rationale for this approach and some of the findings garnered from this approach as well as patents targeting the glutamatergic system especially the NMDAR.",

This hypothesis was tested by measuring dopamine (DA) release by intracranial microdialysis during voluntary oral ethanol self-administration in alcohol-preferring (P) and genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. The animals were trained to respond for ethanol (10% w/v) or water in a free-choice operant task. Extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens were subsequently monitored during 30-min self-administration sessions and a 15-min \"waiting period\" before session onset. Ethanol self-administration in all animals was followed by a significant, dose-dependent rise in DA release with maximal effects at approximately 15 min after peak intake. Dose-effect functions revealed significantly steeper slopes for the DA-releasing effects of ethanol in P than in genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. Over an identical range of ethanol doses and blood alcohol levels, increases in DA efflux ranged from 143% to 459% of basal levels in P rats but only from 142% to 212% in Wistar rats. To differentiate the pharmacological effects of ethanol from the effects of operant responding, additional groups of P and Wistar rats were tested during self-administration of saccharin (0.05% w/v). By contrast with ethanol, saccharin did not substantially elevate extracellular DA levels. A significant, transient increase in DA efflux was, however, observed in both strains of rats during the presession waiting period in the absence of ethanol or saccharin availability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Neuroadaptation theories predict that compensatory changes in neurochemical systems that are activated by alcohol acutely may underlie symptoms of withdrawal after chronic administration. To test this hypothesis, the release of DA and 5-HT was monitored by microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens of dependent male Wistar rats at the end of a 3–5 week ethanol (8.7% w/v) liquid diet regimen, during 8 hr of withdrawal, and during renewed availability of ethanol involving (1) the opportunity to operantly self-administer ethanol (10% w/v) for 60 min, followed by (2) unlimited access to the ethanol-liquid diet. Results were compared to control groups pair-fed with ethanol-free liquid diet and trained to self-administer either ethanol or water. In nondependent rats, operant ethanol self-administration increased both DA and 5-HT release in the NAC. Withdrawal from the chronic ethanol diet produced a progressive suppression in the release of these transmitters over the 8 hr withdrawal period. Self-administration of ethanol reinstated and maintained DA release at prewithdrawal levels but failed to completely restore 5-HT efflux. 5-HT levels recovered rapidly, however, within 1 hr of reexposure to ethanol liquid diet. These findings suggest that deficits in accumbal monoamine release may contribute to the negative affective consequences ethanol withdrawal and, thereby, motivate ethanol-seeking behavior in dependent subjects.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a major fuel and an important nitrogen source for the small intestinal cell. It plays a key role in maintaining mucosal cell integrity and gut barrier function. Increased permeability may be a factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may be an interesting parameter in the follow-up of the disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether oral glutamine supplements are able to restore an increased intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.\nMETHODS: The inclusion criteria for the study were Crohn's disease and a disturbed small intestinal permeability for 51Cr-EDTA. Of 38 patients screened, 18 had an increased permeability (6 hours urinary excretion >1.1% of label recovered in urine). Fourteen patients were included in the study and were randomized to receive either oral glutamine (7 g three times per day; n = 7) or placebo (7 g glycine three times per day; n = 7) in addition to their normal treatment during a 4-week period. The study was performed in a double-blind manner.\nRESULTS: Baseline permeability (mean +/- SD) was 2.32%+/-0.77% dose in the glutamine group and 2.29%+/-0.67% dose in the placebo group. Permeability did not change significantly after glutamine (3.26%+/-2.15% dose) or after placebo (2.27%+/-1.32% dose). There was no significant effect on plasma glutamine, plasma glutamate, plasma ammonium, Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, or nutritional status.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral glutamine supplements, in the dose administered, do not seem to restore impaired permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.",

		"abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated a correlation between ethanol intake and cigarette smoking in heavy drinkers. We have studied the underlying pharmacological basis of this relationship using cultured rat cortical neurons. These neurons express nicotinic receptors having characteristics similar to those described for the alpha4beta2 subunit combination. In the presence of alpha-bungarotoxin both acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine evoked currents with respective EC50 values of 4.3 and 3.4 microM. The maximal nicotine-activated response, however, was only 56% that of the maximal ACh current. It was previously shown that 10 to 100 mM of ethanol potentiated ACh-mediated currents in these neurons. We demonstrate that 100 mM ethanol similarly potentiates currents evoked by 300 nM (40%) and 1 microM nicotine 61%). This suggests that an ethanol-induced potentiation of nicotinic currents may enhance the acute positive reinforcement associated with nicotine and could increase tobacco use during heavy ethanol intake. However, further experimentation indicated that the continuous perfusion of 30, 100, or 300 nM nicotine desensitizes ACh-evoked currents by 38, 54, and 62%, respectively, with little direct receptor-channel activation. The residual ACh currents of nicotine-desensitized receptor channels were potentiated by 100 mM ethanol to nearly the extent as were the undesensitized control responses. We propose that the opposing effect of ethanol on nicotine-induced desensitization could also explain the increased tobacco use observed with excessive drinking. Thus, ethanol has a dual effect regarding nicotine. It enhances acute nicotine-mediated receptor activation, although opposing the net effect of nicotine-induced receptor channel desensitization.",

		"abstract": "Role of l-glutamine in the protection of intestinal epithelium from acetaldehyde-induced disruption of barrier function was evaluated in Caco-2 cell monolayer. l-Glutamine reduced the acetaldehyde-induced decrease in transepithelilal electrical resistance and increase in permeability to inulin and lipopolysaccharide in a time- and dose-dependent manner; d-glutamine, l-aspargine, l-arginine, l-lysine, or l-alanine produced no significant protection. The glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine failed to affect the l-glutamine-mediated protection of barrier function. l-Glutamine reduced the acetaldehyde-induced redistribution of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the intercellular junctions. Acetaldehyde dissociates occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the actin cytoskeleton, and this effect was reduced by l-glutamine. l-Glutamine induced a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor, and the protective effect of l-glutamine was prevented by AG1478, the EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These results indicate that l-glutamine prevents acetaldehyde-induced disruption of the tight junction and increase in the paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayer by an EGF receptor-dependent mechanism.",

		"abstract": "Blood ammonia concentration increases during endurance exercise and has been proposed as a cause for both peripheral and central fatigue. We examined the impact of glutamine and (or) carbohydrate supplementation on ammonemia in high-level runners. Fifteen men in pre-competitive training ran 120 min (approximately 34 km) outdoors on 4 occasions. On the first day, the 15 athletes ran without the use of supplements and blood samples were taken every 30 min. After that, each day for 4 d before the next 3 exercise trials, we supplemented the athletes' normal diets in bolus with carbohydrate (1 g.kg(-1).d(-1)), glutamine (70 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), or a combination of both in a double-blind study. Blood ammonia level was determined before the run and every 30 min during the run. During the control trial ammonia increased progressively to approximately 70% above rest concentration. Following supplementation, independent of treatment, ammonia was not different (p>0.05) for the first 60 min, but for the second hour it was lower than in the control (p<0.05). Supplementation in high-level, endurance athletes reduced the accumulation of blood ammonia during prolonged, strenuous exercise in a field situation.",

		"abstract": "Taurine, glutamine and arginine are examples of amino acids which have become increasingly popular as ingredients in dietary supplements and functional foods and beverages. Animal and human clinical research suggests that oral supplementation of these amino acids provides additional health and/or performance benefits beyond those observed from normal intake of dietary protein. The increased consumer awareness and use of these amino acids as ingredients in dietary supplements and functional foods warrant a comprehensive review of their safety through quantitative risk assessment, and identification of a potential safe upper level of intake. The absence of a systematic pattern of adverse effects in humans in response to orally administered taurine (Tau), l-glutamine (Gln) and l-arginine (Arg) precluded the selection of a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). Therefore, by definition, the usual approach to risk assessment for identification of a tolerable upper level of intake (UL) could not be used. Instead, the newer method described as the Observed Safe Level (OSL) or Highest Observed Intake (HOI) was utilized. The OSL risk assessments indicate that based on the available published human clinical trial data, the evidence for the absence of adverse effects is strong for Tau at supplemental intakes up to 3 g/d, Gln at intakes up to 14 g/d and Arg at intakes up to 20 g/d, and these levels are identified as the respective OSLs for normal healthy adults. Although much higher levels of each of these amino acids have been tested without adverse effects and may be safe, the data for intakes above these levels are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety, and therefore these values are not selected as the OSLs.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of nutraceutical oral administration of L-glutamine (L-Gln) in middle-aged and elderly individuals.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, crossover, double-blind clinical study, 30 residents of a long-term-care institution, selected according to a modified SENIEUR protocol (Working Party of the EURAGE Concerted Action Programme on Ageing of the European Community), were studied. Fourteen subjects received orally 0.5 g kg(-1) d(-1) of L-Gln and 16 received calcium caseinate for 14 d, followed by a 5-d washout. Supplements were switched for the second 14-d trial. Laboratory tests for hepatic and renal functions and ammonemia were performed and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated.\nRESULTS: Of the 30 subjects, 16 were men, mean age was 69+/-8.8 y, average weight was 61.8+/-14.2 kg, and mean serum albumin was 4.0+/-0.3g/dL. Neither adverse clinical effects nor clinically significant laboratory changes were noted during L-Gln supplementation. There was no difference in ammonemia between the groups. There were statistically but not clinically significant increases in plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. There was no significant decrease in eGFR during calcium caseinate supplementation (-2.9%). The eGFR decreased significantly after L-Gln supplementation (-13.3%) but well below the 25% limit for biologic significance.\nCONCLUSION: Increases in serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and decrease in eGFR are probably due to difficulties by older kidneys in metabolizing the supplemented protein sources. Although not clinically significant, those alterations impose a rigorous control on the evaluation parameters of renal function during oral L-Gln supplementation, with doses of 0.5 g kg(-1) d(-1) in middle-aged and elderly individuals.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP.\nAIM: We evaluated the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD.\nMETHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein, respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was performed by computerized image analysis system.\nRESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 ± 10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively, with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000). The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68 (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P = 0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009).\nCONCLUSIONS: Intestinal permeability and morphology improved significantly in both glutamine and ACG.",

		"abstract": "White-rot fungus Inonotus obliquus grown in submerged culture produces antioxidative phenolic compounds. In this study, addition of lignocellulosic materials into the liquid culture increased the production and antioxidant activity of extra- and intra-cellular phenolic compounds (EPC and IPC, respectively). The production of EPC and IPC was significantly enhanced by wheat straw (by 151.2 and 45.3 %), sugarcane bagasse (by 106.9 and 26.1 %), and rice straw (by 67.6 and 38.9 %). Both of the EPC and IPC extracts from the three substrates showed a higher hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity than those from the control medium. The highly active polyphenols such as tea catechins of epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and phelligridin G in the EPC extracts increased by 113.1, 75.0, and 86.3 % in the sugarcane bagasse medium. Davallialactone and inoscavin B in the EPC extracts were generated in large amounts in the lignocellulose media but not found in the control medium. The IPC extract from the wheat straw medium had the highest production of EGCG and ECG (17.6 and 18.1 mg/l). The different enhancement among the materials was attributed to the content and degradation rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The different antioxidant activity of the EPC and IPC extracts was related to their phenolic compositions.",

		"abstract": "Methylene blue (MB) delays cellular senescence, induces complex-IV, and activates Keap1/Nrf2; however, the molecular link of these effects to MB is unclear. Since MB is redox-active, we investigated its effect on the NAD/NADH ratio in IMR90 cells. The transient increase in NAD/NADH observed in MB-treated cells triggered an investigation of the energy regulator AMPK. MB induced AMPK phosphorylation in a transient pattern, which was followed by the induction of PGC1α and SURF1: both are inducers of mitochondrial and complex-IV biogenesis. Subsequently MB-treated cells exhibited >100% increase in complex-IV activity and a 28% decline in cellular oxidants. The telomeres erosion rate was also significantly lower in MB-treated cells. A previous research suggested that the pattern of AMPK activation (i.e., chronic or transient) determines the AMPK effect on cell senescence. We identified that the anti-senescence activity of MB (transient activator) was 8-times higher than that of AICAR (chronic activator). Since MB lacked an effect on cell cycle, an MB-dependent change to cell cycle is unlikely to contribute to the anti-senescence activity. The current findings in conjunction with the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 suggest a synchronized activation of the energy and cellular defense pathways as a possible key factor in MB's potent anti-senescence activity., \n          \n            fx1\n            \n          \n        , \n          \n            \n              •\n              Methylene blue (MB) transiently increases the ratios NAD/NADH and pAMPK/AMPK.\n            \n            \n              •\n              MB induces PGC1α, SURF1, and complex IV biogenesis.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Oxidants production as well as telomere erosion decreases in MB-treated cells.\n            \n            \n              •\n              MB activates the metabolic pathways of cell defense and energy metabolism.\n            \n            \n              •\n              MB, a potent anti-senescence agent in vitro, maybe also effective in vivo.",

We hypothesized that luminal l-glutamate, which is the primary nutrient conferring fundamental umami or proteinaceous taste, influences mucosal defense mechanisms in rat duodenum. We perfused the duodenal mucosa of anesthetized rats with l-glutamate (0.1–10 mM). Intracellular pH (pHi) of the epithelial cells, blood flow, and mucus gel thickness (MGT) were simultaneously and continuously measured in vivo. Some rats were pretreated with indomethacin or capsaicin. Duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) was measured with flow-through pH and CO2 electrodes. We tested the effects of agonists or antagonists for metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 1 or 4 or calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on defense factors. Luminal l-glutamate dose dependently increased pHi and MGT but had no effect on blood flow in the duodenum. l-glutamate (10 mM)-induced cellular alkalinization and mucus secretion were inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin or capsaicin. l-glutamate effects on pHi and MGT were mimicked by mGluR4 agonists and inhibited by an mGluR4 antagonist. CaSR agonists acidified cells with increased MGT and DBS, unlike l-glutamate. Perfusion of l-glutamate with inosinate (inosine 5′-monophosphate, 0.1 mM) enhanced DBS only in combination, suggesting synergistic activation of the l-glutamate receptor, typical of taste receptor type 1. l-leucine or l-aspartate had similar effects on DBS without any effect on pHi and MGT. Preperfusion of l-glutamate prevented acid-induced cellular injury, suggesting that l-glutamate protects the mucosa by enhancing mucosal defenses. Luminal l-glutamate may activate multiple receptors and afferent nerves and locally enhance mucosal defenses to prevent subsequent injury attributable to acid exposure in the duodenum.",

		"abstract": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid of the human body. Besides its role as a constituent of proteins and its importance in amino acid transamination, glutamine has regulatory capacity in immune and cell modulation. Glutamine deprivation reduces proliferation of lymphocytes, influences expression of surface activation markers on lymphocytes and monocytes, affects the production of cytokines, and stimulates apoptosis. Moreover, glutamine administration seems to have a positive effect on glucose metabolism in the state of insulin resistance. Glutamine influences a variety of different molecular pathways. Glutamine stimulates the formation of heat shock protein 70 in monocytes by enhancing the stability of mRNA, influences the redox potential of the cell by enhancing the formation of glutathione, induces cellular anabolic effects by increasing the cell volume, activates mitogen-activated protein kinases, and interacts with particular aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases in specific glutamine-sensing metabolism. Glutamine is applied under clinical conditions as an oral, parenteral, or enteral supplement either as the single amino acid or in the form of glutamine-containing dipeptides for preventing mucositis/stomatitis and for preventing glutamine-deficiency in critically ill patients. Because of the high turnover rate of glutamine, even high amounts of glutamine up to a daily administration of 30 g can be given without any important side effects.",

Although there have been many human studies of its efficacy, there have been very few studies with safety as a primary goal. This article analyzes the literature on the safety of glutamine and also examines the available information on high intakes of total protein and other amino acids, so that additional indicators of potentially adverse effects can be suggested. Four studies that specifically addressed glutamine safety were identified, from which it was concluded that glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. However, the published studies of safety have not fully taken account of chronic consumption by healthy subjects of all age groups. To help identify potential undetected hazards of glutamine intake, the literature on adverse effects of high dietary intake of protein and other amino acids was examined. High protein is reputed to cause nausea, vomiting and ultimately death in adults, and has been shown to result in neurological damage in preterm infants. Individual amino acids cause a variety of adverse effects, some of them potentially fatal, but neurological effects were the most frequently observed. Because glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, psychological and behavioral testing may be especially important.",

Glutamine is also synthesized in skeletal muscle and is involved in protein synthesis within this tissue. During exercise, plasma levels of glutamine decline, and this may affect the concentration of plasma IL-6 via a decrease in IL-6 synthesis and release from muscle. We hypothesized that glutamine supplementation would attenuate the exercise-induced decrease in plasma glutamine concentration and, thus, further enhance levels of plasma IL-6. Eight healthy men participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which they performed 2 h of cycle ergometry at 75% of peak O2 uptake. They received glutamine, glutamine-rich protein, or placebo supplementation at intervals during and 2 h after exercise. Exercise induced an 11-fold increase in plasma IL-6, which was further enhanced by glutamine (18-fold) and glutamine-rich protein (14-fold) supplementation, administered at doses that attenuated the exercise-induced decrease in plasma glutamine concentration.",

		"abstract": "Intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier dysfunction may lead to inflammation and mucosal injury. Glutamine (GLN) plays a role in maintenance of intestinal barrier function in various animal models and critically ill humans. Recent evidence from intestinal cell monolayers indicates that GLN maintains transepithelial resistance and decreases permeability. The mechanisms of these effects remain undefined. We hypothesized that GLN affects proteins involved in the intercellular junctional complex. GLN availability was controlled in Caco-2 monolayers by addition to the medium and treatment with methionine sulfoximine (MSO) to inhibit glutamine synthetase (GS). Expression of TJ proteins, claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occluden (ZO)-1 was measured by immunoblotting. Localization of TJ proteins was evaluated by immunofluorescence light microscopy. Structure of TJ was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Deprivation of GLN decreased claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 protein expression and caused a disappearance of perijunctional claudin-1 and a reduction of occludin but had no effect on ZO-1. TEM revealed that MSO-treated cells in the absence of GLN formed irregular junctional complexes between the apical lateral margins of adjoining cells. These findings indicate that TJ protein expression and cellular localization in Caco-2 cell monolayers rely on GLN. This mechanism may similarly relate to GLN-mediated modulation of intestinal barrier function in stressed animals and humans.",

Intravenous [2H5]phenylalanine and [13C]leucine were simultaneously infused. After gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, whole body protein turnover was estimated from traced plasma amino acid fluxes and the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of gut mucosal protein was calculated from protein and intracellular phenylalanine and leucine enrichments in duodenal biopsies. mRNA levels for ubiquitin, cathepsin D, and m-calpain were analyzed in biopsies by RT-PCR. Glutamine significantly increased mucosal protein FSR compared with saline. Glutamine and amino acids had similar effects on FSR. The mRNA level for ubiquitin was significantly decreased after glutamine infusion compared with saline and amino acids, whereas cathepsin D and m-calpain mRNA levels were not affected.

Simultaneously, a continuous intravenous infusion of l-[1-13C]-leucine was done until endoscopy. Leucine enrichment was assessed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometric analysis, and mucosal fractional synthesis rate was calculated by using intracellular amino acid enrichment as precursor. Mucosal proteolytic pathways were also evaluated.\nResults: ONS infusion resulted in a doubling increase (P < 0.01) of duodenal fractional synthesis rate and a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in cathepsin D–mediated proteolysis compared with saline, whereas proteasome and Ca2+-dependent activities were unaffected. ONS infusion significantly (P < 0.01) decreased duodenal glutathione but not glutathione disulfide concentrations or the ratio of glutathione to glutathione disulfide. Insulinemia increased after ONS infusion, whereas plasma essential amino acids decreased. Infusion of glutamine alone did not reproduce ONS effects.\nConclusions: ONS infusion improves duodenal protein balance in healthy humans. Further investigations are needed to study the origin of these effects and to evaluate ONS supply in stressed persons.",

		"abstract": "Dietary glutamine (Gln) has been shown to be important for maintenance of the intestinal barrier. To investigate the role of the epithelium in this Gln dependence, Caco-2 cells were raised on semipermeable membranes under conditions that model different regions of the crypt and villus. Gln availability was controlled by addition to the medium and treatment with methionine sulfoximine to inhibit Gln synthetase (GS). Barrier function was assayed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and fluxes of [14C]mannitol and fluoroscein isothiocyanate–dextran. The barrier function of these monolayers was found to require the Gln provided either in the medium at the apical or basal surface or via GS. However, the barrier was no more sensitive to Gln deprivation than it was to accumulation or maintenance of total protein. These results suggest that the in vivo dependence of the gut mucosal barrier on Gln likely involves roles separate from maintenance of the epithelial barrier per se.",

Rats irradiated with 10 Gy to the abdomen were randomly divided into a glutamine-free diet group and a glutamine-rich diet (2% glutamine) group. After 3 days of feeding of each diet, the 6-h urinary recovery of polyethylene glycol 4000 was significantly decreased in the glutamine-rich diet group compared to that in the glutamine-free diet group. The 6-h urinary recovery of phenolsulfonphthalein was also decreased in the glutamine-rich diet group, but the difference was not significant. Plasma endotoxin concentration was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group. Twenty-four hour after gavage with 14C-labeled Escherichia coli, the detection rate of 14C-labeled bacteria in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group. The adherence of 14C-labeled E. coli in the jejunal mucosa was significantly lower in the glutamine-rich diet group than in the glutamine-free diet group, but there were no significant differences in the ileal mucosa. These findings suggest that in rats with intestinal injury induced by irradiation, enteral glutamine maintains the intestinal barrier and reduces bacterial translocation.",

Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken from the second part of the duodenum before starting parenteral nutrition, and after two weeks. The ratio between the urine concentrations of lactulose and mannitol after enteral administration was used to measure intestinal permeability. After two weeks of parenteral nutrition in the GlnTPN group, intestinal permeability was unchanged, whereas permeability in the STPN group increased.

Malnutrition and immune dysfunction are common features in hospitalized patients. Specific nutrients with immunological and pharmacological effects, when consumed in amounts above the daily requirement, are referred to as immune-enhancing nutrients or immunonutrients. Supplementation of immunonutrients is important especially for patients with immunodeficiency, virus or overwhelming infections accompanied by a state of malnutrition. Representative immunonutrients are arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, nucleotides, beta-carotene, and/or branched-chain amino acids. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid and performs multiple roles in human body. However, glutamine is depleted from muscle stores during severe metabolic stress including sepsis and major surgery. Therefore it is considered conditionally essential under these conditions. This review discusses the physiological role of glutamine, mode and dose for glutamine administration, as well as improvement of certain disease state after glutamine supplementation. Even though immunonutrition has not been widely assimilated by clinicians other than nutritionists, immunonutrients including glutamine may exert beneficial influence on diverse patient populations.",

		"abstract": "A comparison of the changes in the concentration of glutamine [Gln] in skeletal muscle in a variety of catabolic states with the attendant changes in rates of protein synthesis and degradation indicates a number of substantial correlations which provide insight into both the way in which [Gln] is regulated in muscle and possible regulatory influences of [Gln] on protein balance. There is a striking direct correlation between [Gln] and the rate of protein synthesis in the whole data set. Further examination of this relationship in protein deficiency shows that the changes in [Gln] correlate mainly with the reductions in ribosomal concentration (RNA/protein) and with the decrease in the rate of protein degradation. Because the fall in [Gln] in protein deficiency is also correlated with the decrease in free T3 concentrations, it is suggested that in this case the correlations of [Gln] with rates of protein turnover may be incidental, reflecting thyroidal influences on both protein turnover and glutamine transport. In contrast, in endotoxemia the changes in [Gln] were highly correlated with the ribosomal activity, kRNA, and in this case [Gln] was inversely correlated with the rate of protein degradation. Similar correlated changes occur in starvation and in response to glucocorticoids, and it is suggested that the reductions in [Gln] in endotoxemia could be causally related to the development of insulin resistance and the inhibition of the translational phase of protein synthesis which occurs in these circumstances. The mechanism of the reduction in [Gln] and any linked inhibition of protein synthesis is unknown, but it is shown to be independent of prostaglandin production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

		"abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is well known that enhanced heat shock protein expression protects organisms against morbidity and mortality following experimental injury/illness. Presently, chemical/gene therapy based laboratory methods of enhancing heat shock protein expression are impractical for clinical application. Our laboratory has shown glutamine enhances heat shock protein expression following models of experimental illness/injury. The purpose of this review is to examine recent data supporting the use of glutamine as a clinically relevant enhancer of heat shock protein expression.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies indicate glutamine induces heat shock protein-70, HO-1 (heat shock protein-32), and heat shock protein-27 in models of illness/injury. Enhanced expression of heat shock proteins correlates with improved outcome in these models. Further, in-vitro data reveal glutamine enhances DNA binding of heat shock factor-1 (heat shock protein transcription factor) to its promoter. Finally, recently published pilot data show that glutamine enhances serum heat shock protein-70 expression in critically ill patients and this enhanced expression correlates with improved outcome.\nSUMMARY: Currently, extensive data support glutamine as a gene level regulator of heat shock protein expression. Glutamine depletion, following critical illness/injury, is likely to lead to a state in which organisms are unable to induce heat shock proteins appropriately. Further, pharmacologic supplementation of glutamine potentiates the heat shock protein response prior to and following a stress. Pharmacologic trials utilizing glutamine to enhance heat shock proteins in humans are indicated.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury causes significant morbidity and mortality. Protection against I/R injury may occur via preservation of tissue metabolism and ATP content, preservation of reduced glutathione, and stimulation of heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis. Supplementation with glutamine (GLN) has been reported to have beneficial effects on all of these protective pathways. Thus, we hypothesized that GLN pretreatment given to the rat in vivo would protect the myocardium against I/R-induced dysfunction.\nMETHODS: GLN (0.52 g/kg, intraperitoneally, given as alanine-glutamine dipeptide), alanine alone (0.23 g/kg), or a Ringer's lactate solution (control) was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats 18 hours before heart excision, perfusion, exposure to global ischemia (15 minutes) and reperfusion (1 hour). Tissue metabolites were analyzed via magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: In control and alanine-treated animals, I/R injury resulted in cardiac dysfunction, indicated by a decrease in cardiac output. Administration of GLN 18 hours before I/R injury preserved cardiac output after reperfusion. Metabolic analysis of the myocardial tissue revealed that [/R injury led to significant diminution of myocardial tissue glutamate, ATP content, accumulation of myocardial lactate, and a reduction in reduced glutathione content in control animals. GLN significantly reduced the deleterious changes in myocardial metabolism and improved reduced glutathione content. No changes in pre- or post-I/R injury HSP expression were observed after GLN administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that remote in vivo administration of GLN before cardiac I/R injury can improve post-I/R cardiac function. This effect may be mediated via improved myocardial metabolism and enhanced reduced glutathione content.",

		"abstract": "Although ascorbate has long been known to stimulate dietary iron (Fe) absorption and non-transferrin Fe uptake, the role of ascorbate in transferrin Fe uptake is unknown. Transferrin is a serum Fe transport protein supplying almost all cellular Fe under physiological conditions. We sought to examine ascorbate's role in this process, particularly as cultured cells are typically ascorbate-deficient. At typical plasma concentrations, ascorbate significantly increased 59Fe uptake from transferrin by 1.5–2-fold in a range of cells. Moreover, ascorbate enhanced ferritin expression and increased 59Fe accumulation in ferritin. The lack of effect of cycloheximide or the cytosolic aconitase inhibitor, oxalomalate, on ascorbate-mediated 59Fe uptake from transferrin indicate increased ferritin synthesis or cytosolic aconitase activity was not responsible for ascorbate's activity. Experiments with membrane-permeant and -impermeant ascorbate-oxidizing reagents indicate that while extracellular ascorbate is required for stimulation of 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-citrate, only intracellular ascorbate is needed for transferrin 59Fe uptake. Additionally, experiments with l-ascorbate analogs indicate ascorbate's reducing ene-diol moiety is necessary for its stimulatory activity. Importantly, neither N-acetylcysteine nor buthionine sulfoximine, which increase or decrease intracellular glutathione, respectively, affected transferrin-dependent 59Fe uptake. Thus, ascorbate's stimulatory effect is not due to a general increase in cellular reducing capacity. Ascorbate also did not affect expression of transferrin receptor 1 or 125I-transferrin cellular flux. However, transferrin receptors, endocytosis, vacuolar-type ATPase activity and endosomal acidification were required for ascorbate's stimulatory activity. Therefore, ascorbate is a novel modulator of the classical transferrin Fe uptake pathway, acting via an intracellular reductive mechanism.",

		"abstract": "Objectives\nThe main goals of this study were: (i) to examine genotypic association of the COMT val158met polymorphism with anxiety-related traits via a meta-analysis; (ii) to examine sex and ethnicity as moderators of the association, and (iii) to evaluate whether the association differed by particular anxiety traits.\n\nMethods\nAssociation studies of the COMT val18met polymorphism and anxiety traits were identified from the PubMed or PsycInfo databases, conference abstracts and listserv postings. Exclusion criteria were: (a) pediatric samples, (b) exclusively clinical samples, and (c) samples selected for a non-anxiety phenotype. Standardized mean differences in anxiety between genotypes were aggregated to produce mean effect sizes across all available samples, and for subgroups stratified by sex and ethnicity (Caucasians vs. Asians). Construct-specific analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of COMT with neuroticism, harm avoidance, and behavioral inhibition.\n\nResults\nTwenty seven eligible studies (N=15,979) with available data were identified. Overall findings indicate sex-specific and ethnic-specific effects: Val homozygotes had higher neuroticism than Met homozygotes in studies of Caucasian males (\nES¯=0.13, 95%CI: 0.02 – 0.25, p = 0.03), and higher harm avoidance in studies of Asian males (\nES¯=0.43, 95%CI: 0.14 – 0.72, p = 0.004). No significant associations were found in women and effect sizes were diminished when studies were aggregated across ethnicity or anxiety traits., Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence for sex and ethnicity differences in the association of the COMT val158met polymorphism with anxiety traits. Our findings contribute to current knowledge on the relation between prefrontal dopaminergic transmission and anxiety.",

		"abstract": "The availability of a range of new psychotropic agents raises the possibility that these will be used for enhancement purposes (smart pills, happy pills, and pep pills). The enhancement debate soon raises questions in philosophy of medicine and psychiatry (eg, what is a disorder?), and this debate in turn raises fundament questions in philosophy of language, science, and ethics. In this paper, a naturalistic conceptual framework is proposed for addressing these issues. This framework begins by contrasting classical and critical concepts of categories, and then puts forward an integrative position that is based on cognitive-affective research. This position can in turn be used to consider the debate between pharmacological Calvinism (which may adopt a moral metaphor of disorder) and psychotropic utopianism (which may emphasize a medical metaphor of disorder). I argue that psychiatric treatment of serious psychiatric disorders is justified, and that psychotropics are an acceptable kind of intervention. The use of psychotropics for sub-threshold phenomena requires a judicious weighing of the relevant facts (which are often sparse) and values.",

This study attempts to overcome some of the weaknesses of previous research, namely, small sample sizes, clinical samples, ethnic stratification, wide age ranges, neglecting sex differences, and single measures of personality traits. A large sample (n=556, 250 male, 306 female) of healthy Chinese college students (mean age=20.5±1 years) was given a battery of personality scales, including the temperament and character inventory-revised, the behavioral inhibition system and behavioral approach system scale, the Beck depression inventory, and the Beck anxiety inventory. Factor analysis of the affect-related personality traits revealed two factors that corresponded to positive (PEM) and negative emotionality (NEM). We found a consistent COMT-by-sex interaction effect on affect-related personality traits. Compared with males with Met/Met alleles, males with Val/Val alleles showed significantly higher scores on NEM, but lower scores on PEM. Females, however, showed an opposite but nonsignificant pattern. Our results supported the role of the COMT gene in personality traits for males and contributed to the growing literature on sex differences in gene–behavior connections.",

		"abstract": "Various genes are known to modulate the delicate balance of dopamine in prefrontal cortex and influence cortical information processing. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on chromosome 22q11 is the most widely studied of these genes. Val158Met, a common, functional variant in the coding sequence that increases or decreases the enzymatic activity of the gene has been shown to impact the efficiency of prefrontally-mediated cognition, specifically executive functioning, working memory, fluid intelligence and attentional control., We review the fast-paced evolving literature exploring the association between COMT genotype and cognitive performance, and illustrate how this polymorphism has served a pivotal role in characterizing various interacting dimensions of complexity in the relationship between genes and cognition. We review how Val158Met has been used to help develop and validate behavioural and neurophysiological phenotypes, as a critical tool in dissecting overlapping neural functional systems and exploring interactions within and between genes, and in exploring how gene effects on cognition are modulated by environmental, demographic and developmental factors. Despite the impressive range of findings, the COMT story is also a bracing reminder of how much work remains to translate this knowledge into practical clinical applications.",

Preserving astrocytes is critical for normal brain function as well as for protecting the brain against various insults. Our previous studies have indicated that methylene blue (MB) functions as an alternative electron carrier and enhances brain metabolism. In addition, MB has been shown to be protective against neurodegeneration and brain injury. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of MB in astrocytes. Cell viability assays showed that MB treatment significantly protected primary astrocytes from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) & reoxygenation induced cell death. We also studied the effect of MB on cellular oxygen and glucose metabolism in primary astrocytes following OGD-reoxygenation injury. MB treatment significantly increased cellular oxygen consumption, glucose uptake and ATP production in primary astrocytes. In conclusion our study demonstrated that MB protects astrocytes against OGD-reoxygenation injury by improving astrocyte cellular respiration.",

		"abstract": "The redox dye methylene blue (MB) is proven to have beneficial effects in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we investigated the effects of MB (100 nM, 300 nM, and 1 μM) on key bioenergetic parameters and on H2O2 production/elimination in isolated guinea pig brain mitochondria under normal as well as respiration-impaired conditions. As measured by high-resolution Oxygraph the rate of resting oxygen consumption was increased, but the ADP-stimulated respiration was unaffected by MB with any of the substrates (glutamate malate, succinate, or α-glycerophosphate) used for supporting mitochondrial respiration. In mitochondria treated with inhibitors of complex I or complex III MB moderately but significantly increased the rate of ATP production, restored ΔΨm, and increased the rate of Ca2+ uptake. The effects of MB are consistent with transferring electrons from upstream components of the electron transport chain to cytochrome c, which is energetically favorable when the flow of electrons in the respiratory chain is compromised. On the other hand, MB significantly increased the production of H2O2 measured by Amplex UltraRed fluorimetry under all conditions, in resting, ATP-synthesizing, and respiration-impaired mitochondria, with each substrate combination supporting respiration. Furthermore, it also decreased the elimination of H2O2. Generation of H2O2 without superoxide formation, observed in the presence of MB, is interpreted as a result of reduction of molecular oxygen to H2O2 by the reduced MB. The elevated generation and impaired elimination of H2O2 should be considered for the overall oxidative state of mitochondria treated with MB.",

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease explained by extracellular amyloid beta deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increasing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction displays significant role in the pathophysiological processes of AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction involves alterations in mitochondrial respiratory enzyme complex activities, oxidative stress, opening of permeability transition pore and enhanced apoptosis. Various bioenergetics and antioxidants have been tried or under different investigational phase against AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) because of their complex and multiple site of action. These mitochondrial-targeting bioenergetics and antioxidant compounds such as coenzyme Q10, idebenone, creatine, mitoQ, mitovitE, mitotempol, latrepirdine, methylene blue, triterpenoids, SS peptides, curcumin, Ginkgo biloba and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with potential efficacy in AD have been identified. Present review is intent to discuss mitochondrial restorative mechanisms of these bioenergetics and antioxidants as a potential alternative drug strategy for effective management of AD.",

		"abstract": "Polyphenols are important secondary metabolites from the edible and medicinal mushroom Inonotus obliquus. Both the rarity of I. obliquus fruit body and the low efficiency of current method of submerged fermentation lead to a low yield of polyphenols. This study was aimed to determine the effect of applying stimulatory agents to liquid cultured I. obliquus on the simultaneous accumulation of exo-polyphenols (EPC) and endo-polyphenols (IPC). Linoleic acid was the most effective out of the 17 tested stimulatory agents, the majority of which increased the EPC and IPC production. The result was totally different from the stimulatory effect of Tween 80 for polysaccharide production in previous studies. The addition of 1.0 g/L linoleic acid on day 0 resulted in 7-, 14-, and 10-fold of increase (p < 0.05) in the production of EPC extracted by ethyl acetate (EA-EPC), EPC extracted by n-butyl alcohol (NB-EPC), and IPC, and significantly increased the production of ferulic acid, gallic acid, epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), phelligridin G, inoscavin B, and davallialactone. The EA-EPC, BA-EPC, and IPC from the linoleic acid-containing medium had significantly (p < 0.05) stronger scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH), which was attributed to the higher content of these bioactive polyphenols.",

The objectives of this work were to investigate the ability of I. obliquus under submerged fermentation for the peanut shell biomass degradation and for the simultaneous enhancement of production and antioxidant activity of polysaccharides and polyphenols. Approximate 66.2%, 67.6%, and 70.2% of the initial cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the peanut shells were degraded after 12 days of fermentation. The lignocellulose degradation showed a stimulatory effect on mycelial yield, production and antioxidant activity of extra- and intra-cellular polysaccharides and polyphenols. Highly active polyphenols such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin-3-gallate, phelligridin G, davallialactone, and inoscavin B were generated in larger amounts and phenolic acids such as gallic acid and ferulic acid were decreased dramatically by the lignocellulose degradation.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) increase after ethanol (EtOH) administration in the rat, a response that may be involved in the positive reinforcing effects of EtOH. The mechanisms underlying this DA activation and how they relate to EtOH reinforcement remain to be elucidated, but recent data indicate that glycine receptors (GlyRs) in the nAc may be involved. Here this hypothesis was further challenged by examining the influence of bilateral accumbal application of glycine (a GlyR agonist), strychnine (a GlyR competitive antagonist), or Ringer on EtOH intake and preference, as well as on the concomitant DA output in the nAc, in EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats.\nMETHODS: EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats [EtOH preference >60% during continuous access to a bottle of EtOH (6% v/v) and a bottle of water] were limited to drink 1 hr/day (limited access drinking). Thereafter, the animals were equipped bilaterally with microdialysis probes aimed at the mAc, and were subjected to in vivo microdialysis (coupled to high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) and reversed microdialysis (for drug application) during two experimental days (balanced study), during which the animals were allowed a choice between EtOH and water.\nRESULTS: The EtOH consumption in rats that were perfused with Ringer in the nAc was approximately 0.9 g/kg/hr and associated with a significant increase in extracellular accumbal DA levels. In a subpopulation of rats, bilateral accumbal glycine (100 microM) perfusion produced a significant increase in accumbal DA output and a decrease in EtOH preference and intake. In these glycine responders, the EtOH consumed (approximately 0.7 g/kg/hr) did not produce a further increase of DA levels. In other rats, bilateral glycine perfusion did not change the accumbal DA output, and voluntary EtOH intake was not altered. In these glycine nonresponders, EtOH tended to increase accumbal DA levels. Bilateral accumbal strychnine (20 microM) perfusion significantly decreased DA output in the nAc, and the DA levels remained decreased despite a statistically significant increase of EtOH intake. Finally, the increase in accumbal DA levels observed after EtOH consumption in Ringer-treated rats was significantly larger in glycine responders than in glycine nonresponders.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that glycine and strychnine alter extracellular DA levels in the nAc, probably via GlyR stimulation and blockade, respectively, and concomitantly glycine and strychnine reciprocally alter also EtOH consumption in EtOH high-preferring male Wistar rats. The possibility of developing selective GlyR agonists and/or antagonists should be explored. Such agents could prove of value in the treatment of alcoholism.",

		"abstract": "Herein, we have reviewed the role of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, in a number of neurochemical, -physiological, and -behavioral processes mediating the development of alcohol dependence. The findings discussed include results from both preclinical as well as neuroimaging and postmortem clinical studies. Expression levels for a number of glutamate-associated genes and/or proteins are modulated by alcohol abuse and dependence. These changes in expression include metabotropic receptors and ionotropic receptor subunits as well as different glutamate transporters. Moreover, these changes in gene expression parallel the pharmacologic manipulation of these same receptors and transporters. Some of these gene expression changes may have predated alcohol abuse and dependence because a number of glutamate-associated polymorphisms are related to a genetic predisposition to develop alcohol dependence. Other glutamate-associated polymorphisms are linked to age at the onset of alcohol-dependence and initial level of response/sensitivity to alcohol. Finally, findings of innate and/or ethanol-induced glutamate-associated gene expression differences/changes observed in a genetic animal model of alcoholism, the P rat, are summarized. Overall, the existing literature indicates that changes in glutamate receptors, transporters, enzymes, and scaffolding proteins are crucial for the development of alcohol dependence and there is a substantial genetic component to these effects. This indicates that continued research into the genetic underpinnings of these glutamate-associated effects will provide important novel molecular targets for treating alcohol abuse and dependence.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nIn recent years in vivo microdialysis has become an important method in research studies investigating the alterations of neurotransmitters in the extracellular fluid of the brain. Based on the major involvement of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mediating a variety of alcohol effects in the mammalian brain, numerous microdialysis studies have focused on the dynamical behavior of these systems in response to alcohol.\n\nMethods\nHere we performed multiple meta-analyses on published datasets from the rat brain: (i) we studied basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate and GABA in brain regions that belong to a neurocircuitry involved in neuropsychiatric diseases, especially in alcoholism (Noori et al., Addict Biol 17:827-864, 2012); (ii) we examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on glutamate and GABA levels within this network and (iii) we studied alcohol withdrawal-induced alterations in glutamate and GABA levels within this neurocircuitry.\n\nResults\nFor extraction of basal concentrations of these neurotransmitters, datasets of 6932 rats were analyzed and the absolute basal glutamate and GABA levels were estimated for 18 different brain sites. In response to different doses of acute ethanol administration, datasets of 529 rats were analyzed and a non-linear dose response (glutamate and GABA release) relationship was observed in several brain sites. Specifically, glutamate in the nucleus accumbens shows a decreasing logarithmic dose response curve. Finally, regression analysis of 11 published reports employing brain microdialysis experiments in 104 alcohol-dependent rats reveals very consistent augmented extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in various brain sites that correlate with the intensity of the withdrawal response were identified.\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, our results provide standardized basal values for future experimental and in silico studies on neurotransmitter release in the rat brain and may be helpful to understand the effect of ethanol on neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, this study illustrates the benefit of meta-analyses using the generalization of a wide range of preclinical data.",

		"abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that glycine receptors in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) are involved in modulating both basal and ethanol-induced dopamine output in the same brain region. Ethanol is known to induce a release of both taurine and dopamine in the nAc, but the relationship between these two neuromodulators has not been investigated thoroughly. In vivo microdialysis was used to measure the effects of systemic ethanol diluted in isotonic (0.9% NaCl) or hypertonic (3.6% NaCl) saline on accumbal taurine and dopamine levels. We found that ethanol given in a hypertonic solution, contrary to an isotonic solution, failed to increase concentrations both of taurine and dopamine in the nAc. However, a modest, non-dopamine elevating concentration of taurine in the nAc disclosed a dopamine-elevating effect of systemic ethanol also when given in a hypertonic solution. In a second experiment, we investigated the effects of ethanol on taurine and dopamine in normal rats and rats with decreased levels of endogenous taurine. Lowering the level of taurine, approximately 40% by adding 5% β-alanine in the drinking water, did not influence taurine or dopamine output over time. We conclude that the elevations of taurine and dopamine in the nAc are closely related, and that in order for ethanol to induce dopamine release, a simultaneous increase of extracellular taurine levels in the nAc is required. These data also provide support for the notion that the nAc is the primary target for ethanol in its dopamine-activating effect after systemic administration.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ethanol (EtOH), like other drugs of abuse, increases extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) of the brain reward system, an effect that may be of importance for alcohol addiction. How this DA increase is produced is not fully understood, although previous studies from the present laboratories indicate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the ventral tegmental area play an important role in mediating this effect. Furthermore, activation of these receptors may be secondary to some priming effect produced by EtOH in the nAc. We recently demonstrated that strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyRs) are present in the nAc and that they are involved in regulating extracellular DA levels. Here we examine the tentative role of these accumbal GlyRs in the above-mentioned priming mechanism of EtOH.\nMETHOD: In vivo microdialysis (coupled to high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) and reversed microdialysis, in awake, freely moving adult male Wistar rats.\nRESULTS: Local perfusion of strychnine decreased accumbal DA levels per se and completely prevented the increase of accumbal DA levels after both local and systemic EtOH administration. Accumbal perfusion of the GlyR agonist glycine instead increased DA levels in a subpopulation of rats and prevented the EtOH-induced increase after local but not systemic EtOH in all animals.\nCONCLUSION: The present results suggest that GlyRs in the nAc might constitute targets for EtOH in its mesolimbic DA-activating effect. Gene polymorphism and drug developmental studies that focus on this receptor population and its relation to alcohol dependence are warranted.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system seems to be centrally involved in regulating reward-related behavior and consequently has been implicated in addictive processes, such as alcoholism and drug addiction. This DA system has also been implicated in psychosis and in regulating hedonia/anhedonia, important components of mania and depression. Given the potentially great importance of the mesolimbic DA system for several psychiatric disorders, it is of major interest to delineate the mechanisms and dynamics underlying DA regulation and release. Recently strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors (GlyR) have attracted some interest in this matter.\nMETHODS: Western blot and in vivo microdialysis (couplied to high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), as well as reversed microdialysis, in awake, freely moving, adult male Wistar rats.\nRESULTS: Here we demonstrate by means of Western blot that alpha GlyR subunit proteins are expressed in the rat nucleus accumbens (nAc), a major target of the mesolimbic DA system. We further show that reversed microdialysis of the competitive GlyR antagonist strychnine into the nAc concentration-dependently (2-200 microM) and in a reversible manner decreases accumbal extracellular DA levels. Conversely, reversed microdialysis of the agonist glycine increases accumbal DA levels in some rats but not others. The strychnine-induced depression of the accumbal DA levels is antagonized by simultaneous local perfusion of glycine.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that GlyRs in the nAc are tonically activated and of importance for regulating extracellular DA levels. The possibility of pharmacologically interfering with GlyRs to combat psychiatric disorders, in which the mesolimbic DA system is implicated, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and psychosis, should be explored.",

		"abstract": "Aims To investigate whether the relative amounts of fat, carbohydrate (CHO), or protein in a meal influence the pharmacokinetics of a small dose of ethanol.\n\t\t\t\t, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMethods Nine healthy men received ethanol (0.30 g kg−1 body weight) on five occasions in a randomized cross-over fashion. On three occasions the dose of ethanol was consumed within 15 min of eating a standardized breakfast of similar volume and calorific value but containing different amounts of fat, CHO, and protein. On two other occasions the same dose of ethanol was ingested on an empty stomach (overnight fast) or administered by intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 30 min.\n\t\t\t\t, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults The blood-ethanol profiles showed large inter and intraindividual variations, especially when ethanol was ingested after eating food. The peak blood-alcohol concentrations (BAC) were 16.6±4.0, 17.7±7.1, and 13.3±4.0 mg dl−1 (mean±s.d.) after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals and 30.8±4.3 and 54.3±6.4 mg dl−1 after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The corresponding areas under the concentration-time profiles (AUC) were 1767±549, 1619±760, 1270±406 mg dl−1 min after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals compared with 3210±527 and 4786±446 mg dl−1 min after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The time required to eliminate ethanol from the blood was shortened by 1–2 h in the fed-state.\n\t\t\t\t, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions Drinking ethanol after eating a meal, regardless of the nutritional composition, decreases the systemic availability of ethanol. Because gastric emptying is slow and more prolonged with food in the stomach, the delivery of ethanol to the duodenum and the liver will be highly variable as will the hepatic clearance of ethanol. Provided that portal venous BAC remains fairly low and ethanol metabolizing enzymes are not fully saturated then part of the dose of ethanol can be cleared by hepatic first-pass metabolism (FPM), as one consequence of Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics.",

		"abstract": "Activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was investigated in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol administration by single-cell extracellular recordings from dopaminergic neurons of the ventrotegmental area, coupled with antidromic identification from the nucleus accumbens, and by microdialysis-technique experiments in the nucleus accumbens. Spontaneous firing rates, spikes per burst, and absolute burst firing but not the number of spontaneously active neurons were found drastically reduced; whereas absolute and relative refractory periods increased in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol treatment as compared with chronic saline-treated controls. Consistently, dopamine outflow in the nucleus accumbens and its acid metabolites were reduced after abruptly stopping chronic ethanol administration. All these changes, as well as ethanol-withdrawal behavioral signs, were reversed by ethanol administration. This reversal suggests that the abrupt cessation of chronic ethanol administration plays a causal role in the reduction of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity seen in the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. Results indicate that during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is tonically reduced in activity, as indexed by electrophysiological and biochemical criteria. Considering the role of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the reinforcing properties of ethanol, the depressed activity of this system during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome may be relevant to the dysphoric state associated with ethanol withdrawal in humans.",

The secondary outcome was self assessment of intoxication related symptoms (self confidence, urge to speak, and number of spontaneous hugs), scored on a scale of 0 to 10., Results Plasma ethanol concentrations were below the detection limit of 2.2 mmol/L (10 mg/100 mL) throughout the experiment. No significant changes were observed in the intoxication related symptoms, although self confidence and urge to speak increased slightly at the start of the study, probably due to the setup., Conclusion Our results suggest that feet are impenetrable to the alcohol component of vodka. We therefore conclude that the Danish urban myth of being able to get drunk by submerging feet in alcoholic beverages is just that; a myth. The implications of the study are many though.",

		"abstract": "Mitochondria are thought to play a major role in hepatic oxidative stress associated with alcohol-induced liver injury. Thus, the hypothesis that delivery of the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) via recombinant adenovirus would reduce alcohol-induced liver injury was tested. Rats were given recombinant adenovirus containing Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) and then fed alcohol enterally for 4 weeks. Mn-SOD expression and activity of Ad.SOD2 in liver mitochondria of infected animals was increased nearly 3-fold compared with Ad.lacZ-infected controls. Mitochondrial glutathione levels in Ad.lacZ-infected animals were decreased after 4 weeks of chronic ethanol, as expected, but were unchanged in Ad.SOD2-infected animals. Alanine aminotransferase was elevated significantly by ethanol, an effect that was prevented by Ad.SOD2. Moreover, pathology (e.g. the sum of steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis) was elevated dramatically by ethanol in Ad.lacZ-treated rats. This effect was also blunted in animals infected with Ad.SOD2. Neutrophil infiltration was increased about 3-fold in livers from both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected rats by ethanol treatment. Moreover, ESR-detectable free radical adducts in bile were increased about 8-fold by ethanol. Using13C-labeled ethanol, it was determined that nearly 60% of total adducts were due to the α-hydroxyethyl radical adduct. This increase in radical formation was blocked completely by Ad.SOD2 infection. Furthermore, apoptosis of hepatocytes was increased about 5-fold by ethanol, an effect also blocked by Ad.SOD2. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA was elevated to the same extent in both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected animals follows ethanol exposure. These data suggest that hepatocyte mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in alcohol-induced liver damage and likely follows Kupffer cell activation, cytokine production, and neutrophil infiltration. These results also support the hypothesis that mitochondrial oxidant production is a critical factor in parenchymal cell death caused by alcohol.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of carnosine pretreatment on ethanol-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. Rats were given carnosine (2 g/L in drinking water) for 4 weeks and then ethanol was administered orally to rats at a dose of 5 g/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses totally (binge model). All rats were killed 6 hours after last ethanol injection. Plasma alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) transaminase activities and liver triglyceride, malondialdehyde (MDA), diene conjugate (DC), glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and vitamin C levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities were determined. Binge ethanol administration resulted in significant increases in plasma transaminase activities, hepatic triglyceride and lipid peroxide levels. However, GSH, vitamin E, vitamin C levels and GSH-Px and GST activities were found to be decreased following ethanol administration. Macromicrovesicular steatosis was also seen. Carnosine pretreatment appeared to prevent the increase of plasma ALT and AST activities and hepatic MDA and DC levels following ethanol treatment. In addition, hepatic GSH levels increased, but there were no changes in triglyceride, vitamin E, vitamin C levels and SOD, GSH-Px and GST activities, following ethanol treatment in carnosine-pretreated rats. There was also no change in liver histopathological appearance. In conclusion, carnosine prevented the increases in serum transaminase activities and lipid peroxides in liver of ethanol-treated rats, without any change on steatosis in liver.",

		"abstract": "Although it has been speculated that active oxidants and mitochondrial membrane damages play roles in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damages, its detail remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether ethanol induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) before cell death of gastric mucosal cells. Rat gastric mucosal cells (RGM-1) were kept in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before addition of various concentrations of ethanol. Nuclear morphological aftemations and membrane barrier dysfunction of RGM-1 cells were assessed by staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide, respectively. To assess the contribution of oxygen-derived free radicals and intracellular glutathione, scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical, N,N-dimethylthiourea, glutathione precursor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-methylpyrazole were added before treatment with ethanol. To investigate MPT, calcein and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester were loaded before addition of ethanol, and the changes of fluorescence intensity were monitored using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Ethanol (>5% v/v) dose-dependently increased the number of propidium iodide-positive cells, suggesting a diminished barrier function of cell membrane. After addition of ethanol, mitochondria were filled quickly with calcein indicating MPT, which was accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization, as shown by loss of tetramethylrodamine methyl ester before cell death. Ethanol-induced cell death was significantly attenuated by simultaneous incubation with either N,N-dimethylthiourea or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting the importance of intracellular redox states in inducing cellular damage, whereas such change was not attenuated by 4-methylpyrazole. Present results suggest that ethanol treatment induces intracellular oxidative stress and produces MPT and mitochondrial depolarization, which are preceding cell death in gastric mucosal cells. Intracellular antioxidants, such as glutathione, may have a significant protective action against ethanol in gastric mucosal cells.",

		"abstract": "The major aim of this work was to investigate how alcohol-induced oxidative stress in combined chemotherapy changes the metabolic function of the liver in experimental animals. This research was conducted to establish how bromocriptine, haloperidol and azithromycin, applied to the experimental model, affected the antioxidative status of the liver. The following parameters were determined: reduced glutathione, activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase, catalase, xanthine oxidase and lipid peroxidation intensity. Alanine transaminase was measured in serum. Alcohol stress (AO group) reduced glutathione and the activity of xanthine oxidase and glutathione peroxidase, but increased catalase and alanine transaminase activity. The best protective effect was achieved with the bromocriptine (AB1 group), while other groups had similar effects on the studied parameters.",

		"abstract": "Emerging evidence suggested mitophagy activation mitigates ethanol-induced liver injury. However, the effect of ethanol on mitophagy is inconsistent. Importantly, the understanding of mitophagy status after chronic ethanol consumption is limited. This study evaluated the effect of quercetin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid, on chronic ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage focused on mitophagy. An ethanol regime to mice for 15 weeks (accounting for 30% of total calories) led to significant mitochondrial damage as evidenced by changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and remodeling of membrane lipid composition, which was greatly attenuated by quercetin (100 mg/kg.bw). Moreover, quercetin blocked chronic ethanol-induced mitophagy suppression as denoted by mitophagosomes-lysosome fusion and mitophagy-related regulator elements, including LC3II, Parkin, p62 and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), paralleling with increased FoxO3a nuclear translocation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), instead of AKT and Sirtuin 1, were involved in quercetin-mediated mitophagy activation. Quercetin alleviated ethanol-elicited mitochondrial damage through enhancing mitophagy, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk for cancer of the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract and the upper digestive tract (i.e., upper aerodigestive tract), liver, colon, rectum, and breast. Various factors may contribute to the development (i.e., pathogenesis) of alcohol-associated cancer, including the actions of acetaldehyde, the first and most toxic metabolite of alcohol metabolism. The main enzymes involved in alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are encoded by multiple genes. Because some of these genes exist in several variants (i.e., are polymorphic), and the enzymes encoded by certain variants may result in elevated acetaldehyde levels, the presence of these variants may predispose to certain cancers. Several mechanisms may contribute to alcohol-related cancer development. Acetaldehyde itself is a cancer-causing substance in experimental animals and reacts with DNA to form cancer-promoting compounds. In addition, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that are generated during certain pathways of alcohol metabolism can damage the DNA, thus also inducing tumor development. Together with other factors related to chronic alcohol consumption, these metabolism-related factors may increase tumor risk in chronic heavy drinkers.",

		"abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions and can react with and damage complex cellular molecules such as fats, proteins, or DNA. Alcohol promotes the generation of ROS and/or interferes with the body's normal defense mechanisms against these compounds through numerous processes, particularly in the liver. For example, alcohol breakdown in the liver results in the formation of molecules whose further metabolism in the cell leads to ROS production. Alcohol also stimulates the activity of enzymes called cytochrome P450s, which contribute to ROS production. Further, alcohol can alter the levels of certain metals in the body, thereby facilitating ROS production. Finally, alcohol reduces the levels of agents that can eliminate ROS (i.e., antioxidants). The resulting state of the cell, known as oxidative stress, can lead to cell injury. ROS production and oxidative stress in liver cells play a central role in the development of alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Several studies have described a dose-dependent effect of alcohol on human health with light to moderate drinkers having a lower risk of all-cause mortality than abstainers, while heavy drinkers are at the highest risk. In the case of the immune system, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced inflammation and improved responses to vaccination, while chronic heavy drinking is associated with a decreased frequency of lymphocytes and increased risk of both bacterial and viral infections. However, the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts a dose-dependent effect on the immune system remain poorly understood due to a lack of systematic studies that examine the effect of multiple doses and different time courses. This review will summarize our current understanding of the impact of moderate versus excessive alcohol consumption on the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system derived from both in vitro as well as in vivo studies carried out in humans and animal model studies.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol is a known modulator of the innate immune system. Owing to the absence of human studies, alcohol's effect on circulating cytokine profile remains unclear. We investigated the effect of acute high dose alcohol consumption on systemic cytokine release. After an overnight fasting, alcohol-experienced healthy male volunteers (N = 20) aged 25–45 years were given oral ethanol in the form of vodka (4.28 mL/kg) which they drank over a period of 30 minutes reaching peak blood alcohol concentration of 0.12% (SD 0.028). Blood samples were obtained prior to alcohol intake as well as 2, 7, and 12 hours thereafter. Serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, MCP-1, and TNF-α were determined by the multibead-based assay. Baseline cytokine levels were not related to BMI, hepatic parameters, electrolytes, glucose, or morning cortisol levels. Within 2 hours of alcohol intake, levels of IL-1Ra were elevated and remained so throughout the assessment period (p for trend = 0.015). In contrast, the levels of the chemokine MCP-1 dropped acutely followed by steadily increasing levels during the observation period (p < 0.001). The impact of sustained elevated levels of MCP-1 even after the clearance of blood alcohol content deserves attention.",

In this study, we extend previous work in C57BL/6J mice to: 1) characterize the SCN pharmacokinetics of acute systemic ethanol administration; 2) explore the effects of acute ethanol on photic and non-photic phase-resetting; and 2) determine if the SCN is a direct target for photic effects.\n\nMethods\nFirst, microdialysis was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of acute i.p. injections of 3 doses of ethanol (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg) in the mouse suprachiasmatic (SCN) circadian clock. Second, the effects of acute i.p. ethanol administration on photic phase-delays and serotonergic ([+]8-OH-DPAT-induced) phase-advances of the circadian activity rhythm were assessed. Third, the effects of reverse-microdialysis ethanol perfusion of the SCN on photic phase-resetting were characterized.\n\nResults\nPeak ethanol levels from the 3 doses of ethanol in the SCN occurred within 20–40 min post-injection with half-lives for clearance ranging from 0.6–1.8 hr. Systemic ethanol treatment dose-dependently attenuated photic and serotonergic phase-resetting. This treatment also did not affect basal SCN neuronal activity as assessed by Fos expression. Intra-SCN perfusion with ethanol markedly reduced photic phase-delays.\n\nConclusions\nThese results confirm that acute ethanol attenuates photic phase-delay shifts and serotonergic phase-advance shifts in the mouse. This dual effect could disrupt photic and non-photic entrainment mechanisms governing circadian clock timing. It is also significant that the SCN clock is a direct target for disruptive effects of ethanol on photic shifting. Such actions by ethanol could underlie the disruptive effects of alcohol abuse on behavioral, physiological, and endocrine rhythms associated with alcoholism.",

		"abstract": "Because of the significant morbidity and lethality caused by alcoholic liver disease (ALD), there remains a need to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent and treat ALD. Towards this goal, minimally invasive biomarker discovery represents an outstanding approach for these purposes. The mechanisms underlying ALD include hepatic lipid accumulation. As the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) has been shown to inhibit steatosis, the present study examined the role of PPARβ/δ in ALD coupling metabolomic, biochemical and molecular biological analyses. Wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice were fed either a control or 4% ethanol diet and examined after 4–7 months of treatment. Ethanol fed Pparβ/δ-null mice exhibited steatosis after short-term treatment compared to controls, the latter effect appeared to be due to increased activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). The wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice fed the control diet showed clear differences in their urinary metabolomic profiles. In particular, metabolites associated with arginine and proline metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism, were markedly different between genotypes suggesting a constitutive role for PPARβ/δ in the metabolism of these amino acids. Interestingly, urinary excretion of taurine was present in ethanol-fed wild-type mice but markedly lower in similarly treated Pparβ/δ-null mice. Evidence suggests that PPARβ/δ modulates pyridoxal kinase activity by altering Km, consistent with the observed decreased in urinary taurine excretion. These data collectively suggest that PPARβ/δ prevents ethanol-induced hepatic effects by inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis, modulation of amino acid metabolism, and altering pyridoxal kinase activity.",

		"abstract": "This study was to investigate the possibility of enhancing the anti-fibrotic effect by using a combination therapy with taurine, epigallocatechin gallate and genistein in a rat liver fibrosis model induced by alcohol, and to explore its underlying mechanism. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by intragastric administration with various amount of alcohol (5.0-9.5 g/kg) within 24 weeks in rats. The model group received alcohol only, and treatment groups received the corresponding drugs plus alcohol respectively, while the normal control group received an equal volume of saline. The antifibrotic effects of combination therapy were assessed directly by hepatic histology, and indirectly by measurement of serum biochemical markers, the fibrosis markers and related key cytokines/proteins. The results showed that combination therapy could significantly improve the liver function, as indicated by decreasing levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, combination therapy could effectively suppress the serum levels of fibrosis markers and hepatic hydroxyproline content, inhibit collagen deposition and reduce the pathological tissue damage. Research on mechanism showed that combination therapy was able to markedly reduce lipid peroxidation and recruit the anti-oxidative defense system, and inhibit the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2, α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor β(1) and small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 proteins. Our results showed that combination therapy is effective in attenuating hepatic injury and fibrosis in the alcohol-induced rat model. The improved efficacy of the combination therapy with its good safety profile could represent a new protective approach for liver fibrosis.",

		"abstract": "Both oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions play a major role in alcoholic liver fibrosis. We evaluated the efficacy of ascorbic acid (AA) and silymarin in the regression of alcohol-induced inflammation in hepatocytes of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). Animals were administered with ethanol at a daily dose of 4 g/kg body weight (b.wt) for 90 days. On the ninety-first day, ethanol administration was stopped and animals were divided into alcohol abstention group and silymarin- (25 mg/100 g b.wt) and AA- (25 mg/100 g b.wt) supplemented groups and maintained for 30 days. There was a significant increase in the activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in the serum of the ethanol group. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expressions of cytochrome P4502E1 and nuclear factor κB1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β(1) in hepatocytes were significantly increased in ethanol group. The fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin and α(1)(I) collagen and activity of cytotoxicity marker caspase-3 were significantly increased and AA content was significantly reduced in hepatocytes of alcohol-treated guinea pigs. But the AA and silymarin supplementation significantly reduced these changes in comparison with alcohol abstention group. AA could induce greater reduction of inflammatory and fibrotic markers in hepatocytes than silymarin. This indicates that AA is superior to silymarin in inhibiting intracellular ROS generation and thereby reducing the ethanol-induced inflammation in hepatocytes.",

		"abstract": "Curcumin is known for its antiinflammatory and antifibrotic properties in liver damage. However, the negative effects of curcumin on alcoholic liver damage are seldom reported. In this study, both advantageous and disadvantageous functions of curcumin on alcoholic liver injury were observed. In order to determine the effects of curcumin on liver fibrosis induced by alcohol, 5% ethanol and/or curcumin (1 × 10–3 or 1 × 10–4 m) were injected intravenously in mice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to determine the value of liver injury by optical density analyses. Liver histology was evaluated by an experienced hepatopathologist blinded to the type of treatment received by the animals. Ethanol accelerates serum levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver injury, production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) during 5% ethanol-induced liver injury. 1 × 10–3 m curcumin accelerates liver injury and liver cellular edema during only 5% ethanol-induced liver injury evolution, whereas 1 × 10–4 m curcumin does not lead to (or protect) alcoholic liver injury. Therefore, it is suggested that curcumin may have dual effects on alcoholic liver injury depending on its concentration. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Background\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the number one cause of chronic liver disease and second indication for liver transplantation in the Western world. Effective therapy is still not available. Previously we showed a critical role for caspase-2 in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the potentially progressive form of NAFLD. An imbalance between free Coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl-CoA ratio is known to induce caspase-2 activation.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to evaluate CoA metabolism and the effects of supplementation with CoA precursors, pantothenate and cysteine, in mouse models of NASH.\n\nMethods\nCoA metabolism was evaluated in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) and Western diet mouse models of NASH. MCD-diet fed mice were treated with pantothenate and N-acetylcysteine or placebo to determine effects on NASH.\n\nResults\nLiver free CoA content was reduced, pantothenate kinase (PANK), the rate-limiting enzyme in the CoA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated, and CoA degrading enzymes were increased in mice with NASH. Decreased hepatic free CoA content was associated with increased caspase-2 activity, and correlated with worse liver cell apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment with pantothenate and N-acetylcysteine did not inhibit caspase-2 activation, improve NASH, normalize PANK expression, or restore free CoA levels in MCD diet-fed mice.\n\nConclusion\nIn mice with NASH, hepatic CoA metabolism is impaired, leading to decreased free CoA content, activation of caspase-2, and increased liver cell apoptosis. Dietary supplementation with CoA precursors did not restore CoA levels or improve NASH, suggesting that alternative approaches are necessary to normalize free CoA during NASH.",

		"abstract": "This laboratory showed that ethanol augments apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons and co-treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (LA) or one of several other antioxidants prevents ethanol-associated apoptosis. Because ethanol increases oxidative stress, which causes apoptosis, it is likely that some of the neuroprotective effects of LA and other antioxidants involve classical antioxidant actions. Considering the reported link of LA with pro-survival cell signaling, it is also possible that LA’s neuroprotective effects involve additional mechanisms., The present study investigated the effects of LA on ethanol-treated fetal rhombencephalic neurons with regard to oxidative stress and up-regulation of the pro-survival genes Xiap and Bcl-2. We included parallel gene expression studies with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to determine whether LA’s effects on Xiap and Bcl-2 were shared by other antioxidants. We also used enzyme inhibitors to determine which signaling pathway(s) might be involved with the effects of LA., The results of this investigation showed that LA treatment of ethanol-treated neurons exerted several pro-survival effects. LA blocked two pro-apoptotic changes, i.e., the ethanol-associated rise in ROS and caspase-3. LA also up-regulated the expression genes that encode the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Xiap by a mechanism that involves NF-κB. NAC also up-regulated Bcl-2 and Xiap. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of LA and NAC could involve up-regulation of pro-survival genes as well as their classical antioxidant actions.",

A moderate correlation between the increase in blood alpha-lipoic acid concentration in patients with the liver diseases during the replacement therapy with alpha-lipoic acid drugs and a number of parameters of thrombelastogram was established. It was shown that relief of coenzyme deficit against the background of treatment with lipoic acid is associated with relief of hypocoagulative syndrome and an elevation of the blood ATP level. It is suggested that the ability of the coenzyme to stimulate the bioenergetic protection of hemostasis processes plays the important role in the mechanism of action of alpha-lipoic acid drugs.",

		"abstract": "Thioctic acid, a sulfhydryl agent, given orally macroscopically protected the gastric mucosa from 96% ethanol-induced lesions in a dose-and time dependent fashion. The inhibition of the lesions was 56.0 and 90.3% at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. The duration of its protective effect was approximately 120 minutes. Histopathologically, the oral administration of thioctic acid prevented necrotic mucosal lesions in the deeper part of the mucosa but did not protect the surface epithelial cells against ethanol challenge. Gastric motility measured by a balloon method, was dose-dependently inhibited by the oral administration of thioctic acid. Thioctic acid protection was suppressed by pretreatment with indomethacin (30 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and iodoacetamide (100 mg/kg), a sulfhydryl blocker. The gastric motility inhibited by oral thioctic acid was not reversed by indomethacin or iodoacetamide. These doses of indomethacin or iodomethamide were administered because previously they had been used to suppress endogenous prostaglandins, and nonprotein sulfhydryls of the gastric mucosa, respectively. There was an increase in the fluid volume retained in the gastric lumen for thioctic acid (50 mg/kg) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after administration. There was an increase in the mucus volume retained in the gastric lumen for thioctic acid (50, 25 mg/kg) at 120 minutes after administration. The lesion area in the rats treated with 70 microliters of vehicle and in the rats treated with 250 microliters of vehicle were significantly higher than in the rats treated with 450 microliters of vehicle. The present study suggests that thioctic acid administered orally, offered protection to the rat gastric mucosa against 96% ethanol-induced lesions. This protective effect appears to be dependent on prostaglandin-and sulfhydryl-sensitive mechanisms, together with an increase in both the fluid volume and the mucus volume retained in the gastric lumen, and is not associated with the inhibition of gastric motor activity.",

		"abstract": "Development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs through initial steatosis and subsequent oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) on methionine–choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NAFLD in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (n=21) were divided into three groups (n=7 per group): (1) control fed with standard chow, (2) MCD2 group—fed with MCD diet for 2 weeks, and (3) MCD2+LA group—2 weeks on MCD receiving LA i.p. 100 mg/kg/day. After the treatment, liver samples were taken for pathohistology, oxidative stress parameters, antioxidative enzymes, and liver free fatty acid (FFA) composition. Mild microvesicular hepatic steatosis was found in MCD2 group, while it was reduced to single fat droplets evident in MCD2+LA group. Lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress were increased by MCD diet, while LA administration induced a decrease in liver malondialdehyde and nitrates+nitrites level. Similary, LA improved liver antioxidative capacity by increasing total superoxide dismutase (tSOD), manganese SOD (MnSOD), and copper/zinc-SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) activity as well as glutathione (GSH) content. Liver FFA profile has shown a significant decrease in saturated acids, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while LA treatment increased their proportions. It can be concluded that LA ameliorates lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress in MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis through an increase in SOD activity and GSH level. In addition, LA increases the proportion of palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, and DHA in the fatty liver. An increase in DHA may be a potential mechanism of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of LA in MCD diet-induced NAFLD.",

		"abstract": "Background :  Recent advances in the field of acetaldehyde (AcH) research have raised the need for a comprehensive review on the role of AcH in the actions of alcohol. This update is an attempt to summarize the available AcH research. Methods :  The descriptive part of this article covers not only recent research but also the development of the field. Special emphasis is placed on mechanistic analyses, new hypotheses, and conclusions. Results :  Elevated AcH during alcohol intoxication causes alcohol sensitivity, which involves vasodilation associated with increased skin temperature, subjective feelings of hotness and facial flushing, increased heart and respiration rate, lowered blood pressure, sensation of dry mouth or throat associated with bronchoconstriction and allergy reactions, nausea and headache, and also reinforcing reactions like euphoria. These effects seem to involve catecholamine, opiate peptide, prostaglandin, histamine, and/or kinin mechanisms. The contribution of AcH to the pathological consequences of chronic alcohol intake is well established for different forms of cancer in the digestive tract and the upper airways. AcH seems to play a role in the etiology of liver cirrhosis. AcH may have a role in other pathological developments, which include brain damage, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, and fetal alcohol syndrome. AcH creates both unpleasant aversive reactions that protect against excessive alcohol drinking and euphoric sensations that may reinforce alcohol drinking. The protective effect of AcH may be used in future treatments that involve gene therapy with or without liver transplantation. Conclusions :  AcH plays a role in most of the actions of alcohol. The individual variability in these AcH-mediated actions will depend on the genetic polymorphism, not only for the alcohol and AcH-metabolizing enzymes but also for the target sites for AcH actions. The subtle balance between aversive and reinforcing, protecting and promoting factors will determine the overall behavioral and pathological developments.",

When post-alcohol sera are incubated for 3 hr with ascorbic acid, thioctic acid or dihydrolipoic acid at a concentration of 10–500 μg/ mL, their cytotoxicity against A9 cells is reduced. Post-alcohol sera incubated with these concentrations of thioctic acid or dihydrolipoic acid also had reduced cytotoxic activity against phytohaemagglutinin-transformed normal human lymphocytes. Studies with artificially produced [14C]acetaldehyde-125I-albumin complexes showed that treatment with thioctic acid or dihydrolipoic acid resulted in a reduced transfer of [14C]acetaldehyde to K562 cells. If these in vitro data also apply in vivo and if circulating acetaldehyde-protein adducts play a role in alcohol-mediated tissue damage, vitamin C and, to a greater extent, thioctic acid may have a beneficial effect in patients with acute and chronic alcohol toxicity.",

		"abstract": "The inhibition of several mitochondrial functions by acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol oxidation, was previously shown to be almost completely relieved by cysteine. To study the mechanism of this protective effect, several derivatives of cysteine were also tested. Free sulfhydryl and amino groups appear to be required for maximal protection against the inhibition by acetaldehyde since no protective effect was found with N-acetylcysteine or S-methylcysteine. Cysteine interacts readily with acetaldehyde whereas N-acetylcysteine and S-methylcysteine do not. Penicillamine (β,β-dimethylcysteine) also relieved the inhibition by acetaldehyde, but prior incubation of penicillamine with acetaldehyde was required. Penicillamine was not as effective as cysteine, a finding which correlates with the weaker interaction of penicillamine with acetaldehyde. The greater stability of penicillamine compared to cysteine may be an advantage in studies of the effects of sulfhydryl amino acids on acute and chronic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde.",

		"abstract": "All known pathways of ethanol metabolism result in the production of acetaldehyde, a highly reactive compound. N-acetyl cysteine, an analogue of the dietary amino acid cysteine, binds acetaldehyde, thus preventing its damaging effect on physiological proteins. This study examined the effect of oral N-acetyl cysteine on the increased blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, blood acetaldehyde and adverse renal vascular changes induced by chronic ethanol treatment in rats. Twenty-four male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, age 7 weeks were divided into four groups of six animals each. Animals in group I were given water and group II 5% ethanol in water for the next 14 weeks. Animals in group III were given 5% ethanol + 1% N-acetyl cysteine for 4 weeks followed by 5% ethanol + 2% N-acetyl cysteine for the next 10 weeks. Animals in group IV were given 5% ethanol for 7 weeks; at that time ethanol was withdrawn and animals were placed on water with 2% N-acetyl cysteine for the next 7 weeks. After 14 weeks systolic blood pressure and platelet cytosolic free calcium were all significantly higher (p<0.001) in rats given ethanol as compared to rats in other groups. N-acetyl cysteine treatment, along with ethanol, significantly (p<0.001) attenuated the increased blood pressure and platelet cytosolic free calcium and adverse renal vascular changes. Discontinuation of ethanol treatment for 7 weeks along with N-acetyl cysteine supplementation also significantly lowered the blood pressure and platelet cytosolic free calcium and attenuated adverse renal vascular changes. There was no significant difference in aortic malonaldehyde among four groups. Increase in blood acetaldehyde with ethanol treatment was significantly attenuated with N-acetyl cysteine treatment. These results suggest that acetaldehyde may be the cause of ethanol-induced hypertension and elevated cytosolic free calcium and renal vascular changes.",

		"abstract": "Adult female SPF Sprague-Dawley rats treated orally by gavage with disulfiram (1 g/kg b.wt.) or betalactam antibiotics (3.38 mmol/kg b.wt.) with a 1-methyltetrazole-5-thiol side chain (cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefotetan, cefoperazone, cefamandole) produced a marked, statistically significant rise of acetaldehyde in the blood 1 and 3 hr following IP administration of ethanol [2 g/kg b.wt., 20% (g/v) solution]. This accumulation of blood acetaldehyde remained unchanged or was reduced only very slightly by a mixture of iron sulfate [Fe(II)SO4·7H2O, 2.64 mg/kg b.wt.] and ascorbic acid (6.67 mg/kg b.wt.) injected intravenously. This slight decrease is considered to be due to a formation of a complex between ferrous sulfate and agents (disulfiram and the betalactam antibiotics as well as their metabolites) producing acetaldehyde by inhibition of acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes. A possible coaction of ascorbic acid cannot be explained satisfactorily; ascorbic acid may support cellular redox potentials. The combination of ferrous sulfate and ascorbic acid was used for examination since both chemicals are recommended to reduce adverse symptoms of an ethanol incompatibility reaction in the course of a therapy with the mentioned antibiotics or disulfiram. Since acetaldehyde augmentation in the blood is regarded as a cause of complaints and because the acetaldehyde rise was not depressed significantly by ferrous sulfate and ascorbic acid it can be concluded that these two agents are not potent enough for a rational therapy of ethanol incompatibility symptoms initiated by the investigated drugs.",

		"abstract": "Acetaldehyde (ACH) associated with alcoholic beverages is Group 1 carcinogen to humans (IARC/WHO). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), a major ACH eliminating enzyme, is genetically deficient in 30–50% of Eastern Asians. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. However, there is only a limited evidence for stomach cancer. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that ALDH2 deficiency results in markedly increased exposure of the gastric mucosa to acetaldehyde after intragastric administration of alcohol. Our finding provides concrete evidence for a causal relationship between acetaldehyde and gastric carcinogenesis. A plausible explanation is the gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol. The gastric mucosa expresses alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, especially at the high ethanol concentrations prevailing in the stomach after the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The gastric mucosa also possesses the acetaldehyde-eliminating ALDH2 enzyme. Due to decreased mucosal ALDH2 activity, the elimination of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde is decreased, which results in its accumulation in the gastric juice. We also demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, and L-cysteine cause independent changes in gastric juice and salivary acetaldehyde levels, indicating that intragastric acetaldehyde is locally regulated by gastric mucosal ADH and ALDH2 enzymes, and by oral microbes colonizing an achlorhydric stomach. Markedly elevated acetaldehyde levels were also found at low intragastric ethanol concentrations corresponding to the ethanol levels of many foodstuffs, beverages, and dairy products produced by fermentation. A capsule that slowly releases L-cysteine effectively eliminated acetaldehyde from the gastric juice of PPI-treated ALDH2-active and ALDH2-deficient subjects. These results provide entirely novel perspectives for the prevention of gastric cancer, especially in established risk groups.",

The cytochrome P450 isoform (CYP2E1) specifically involved in ethanol oxidation is discussed. The acetaldehyde metabolism and the shift of the NAD/NADH ratio in the cellular environment (reductive stress) are stressed. The toxic effects of acetaldehyde are mentioned. The ethanol-induced oxidative stress: the increased MDA formation by incubated liver preparations, the absorption of conjugated dienes in mitochondrial and microsomal lipids and the decrease in the most unsaturated fatty acids in liver cell membranes are discussed. The formation of carbon-centered (1-hydroxyethyl) and oxygen-centered (hydroxyl) radicals during the metabolism of ethanol is considered: the generation of hydroxyethyl radicals, which occurs likely during the process of univalent reduction of dioxygen, is highlighted and is carried out by ferric cytochrome P450 oxy-complex (P450–Fe3+O2·−) formed during the reduction of heme-oxygen. The ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation has been evaluated, and it has been shown that plasma F2-isoprostanes are increased in ethanol toxicity.",

		"abstract": "AIM: To investigate the role of metallothionein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on the morphological and biochemical effects of zinc sulfate in ethanol-induced liver injury., METHODS: Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups. Group I; intact rats, group II; control rats given only zinc, group III; animals given absolute ethanol, group IV; rats given zinc and absolute ethanol. Ethanol-induced injury was produced by the 1 mL of absolute ethanol, administrated by gavage technique to each rat. Animals received 100 mg/kg per day zinc sulfate for 3 d 2 h prior to the administration of absolute ethanol., RESULTS: Increases in metallothionein immunoreactivity in control rats given only zinc and rats given zinc and ethanol were observed. PCNA immunohistochemistry showed that the number of PCNA-positive hepatocytes was increased significantly in the livers of rats administered ethanol + zinc sulfate. Acute ethanol exposure caused degenerative morphological changes in the liver. Blood glutathione levels decreased, serum alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase activities increased in the ethanol group when compared to the control group. Liver glutathione levels were reduced, but lipid peroxidation increased in the livers of the group administered ethanol as compared to the other groups. Administration of zinc sulfate in the ethanol group caused a significant decrease in degenerative changes, lipid peroxidation, and alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase activities, but an increase in liver glutathione., CONCLUSION: Zinc sulfate has a protective effect on ethanol-induced liver injury. In addition, cell proliferation may be related to the increase in metallothionein immunoreactivity in the livers of rats administered ethanol + zinc sulfate.",

		"abstract": "L-carnitine has been used as a supplement to treat cardiovascular or liver disease.  However, there has been little information about the effect of L-carnitine on anti-oxidation capability in healthy human subjects.  This study was designed to investigate the correlation between plasma L-carnitine concentration and antioxidant activity.  Liquid L-carnitine (2.0 g) was administered orally as a single dose in 12 healthy subjects.  Plasma concentration of L-carnitine was detected by HPLC.  The baseline concentration of L-carnitine was 39.14 ± 5.65 μmol/L.  After single oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0-∞) were 84.7 ± 25.2 μmol/L and 2,676.4 ± 708.3 μmol/L·h, respectively.  The half-life and the time required to reach the Cmax was 60.3 ± 15.0 min and 3.4 ± 0.46 h, respectively.  There was a gradual increase in plasma concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in the first 3.5 h following L-carnitine administration.  The plasma concentrations of SOD, GSH-Px, catalase and T-AOC returned to baseline levels within 24 h.  A positive correlation was found between L-carnitine concentration and the antioxidant index of SOD (r = 0.992, P < 0.01), GSH-Px (r = 0.932, P < 0.01), catalase (r = 0.972, P < 0.01) or T-AOC (r = 0.934, P < 0.01).  In conclusion, L-carnitine increases activities of antioxidant enzymes and the total antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects.  It may be useful as a supplementary therapy for chronic illnesses involving excessive oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "Abstract:  In mammals, the carnitine pool consists of nonesterified l-carnitine and many acylcarnitine esters. Of these esters, acetyl-l-carnitine is quantitatively and functionally the most significant. Carnitine homeostasis is maintained by absorption from diet, a modest rate of synthesis, and efficient renal reabsorption. Dietary l-carnitine is absorbed by active and passive transfer across enterocyte membranes. Bioavailability of dietary l-carnitine is 54-87% and is dependent on the amount of l-carnitine in the meal. Absorption of l-carnitine dietary supplements (0.5-6 g) is primarily passive; bioavailability is 14-18% of dose. Unabsorbed l-carnitine is mostly degraded by microorganisms in the large intestine. Circulating l-carnitine is distributed to two kinetically defined compartments: one large and slow-turnover (presumably muscle), and another relatively small and rapid-turnover (presumably liver, kidney, and other tissues). At normal dietary l-carnitine intake, whole-body turnover time in humans is 38-119 h. In vitro experiments suggest that acetyl-l-carnitine is partially hydrolyzed in enterocytes during absorption. In vivo, circulating acetyl-l-carnitine concentration was increased 43% after oral acetyl-l-carnitine supplements of 2 g/day, indicating that acetyl-l-carnitine is absorbed at least partially without hydrolysis. After single-dose intravenous administration (0.5 g), acetyl-l-carnitine is rapidly, but not completely hydrolyzed, and acetyl-l-carnitine and l-carnitine concentrations return to baseline within 12 h. At normal circulating l-carnitine concentrations, renal l-carnitine reabsorption is highly efficient (90-99% of filtered load; clearance, 1-3 mL/min), but displays saturation kinetics. Thus, as circulating l-carnitine concentration increases (as after high-dose intravenous or oral administration of l-carnitine), efficiency of reabsorption decreases and clearance increases, resulting in rapid decline of circulating l-carnitine concentration to baseline. Elimination kinetics for acetyl-l-carnitine are similar to those for l-carnitine. There is evidence for renal tubular secretion of both l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine. Future research should address the correlation of supplement dosage, changes and maintenance of tissue l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine concentrations, and metabolic and functional changes and outcomes.",

		"abstract": "Mitochondria play important roles in human physiological processes, and therefore, their dysfunction can lead to a constellation of metabolic and nonmetabolic abnormalities such as a defect in mitochondrial gene expression, imbalance in fuel and energy homeostasis, impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, enhancement of insulin resistance, and abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism. As a consequence, mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, vascular disease, and chronic heart failure. The increased knowledge on mitochondria and their role in cellular metabolism is providing new evidence that these disorders may benefit from mitochondrial-targeted therapies. We review the current knowledge of the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to chronic diseases, the outcomes of experimental studies on mitochondrial-targeted therapies, and explore the potential of metabolic modulators in the treatment of selected chronic conditions. As an example of such modulators, we evaluate the efficacy of the administration of L-carnitine and its analogues acetyl and propionyl L-carnitine in several chronic diseases. L-carnitine is intrinsically involved in mitochondrial metabolism and function as it plays a key role in fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism. In addition to the transportation of free fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, L-carnitine modulates their oxidation rate and is involved in the regulation of vital cellular functions such as apoptosis. Thus, L-carnitine and its derivatives show promise in the treatment of chronic conditions and diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction but further translational studies are needed to fully explore their potential.",

		"abstract": "Carnitine (4-N-trimethylammonium-3-hydroxybutyric acid), a compound necessary for a transfer of fatty acids for their oxidation within the cell, accumulates in brain although β-oxidation of fatty acids is very low in neurons. Carnitine accumulates to lower extent in the brain than in peripheral tissues and the mechanism of its transport through the blood–brain barrier is discussed, with the involvement of two transporters, OCTN2 and B0,+ being presented. A limitation by the blood–brain barrier of carnitine supply for the brain and the mechanism of its transport to neural cells by a protein belonging to neurotransmitters' transporters superfamily is further discussed. Due to the beneficial effects of administration of acetylcarnitine in case of patients with dementia, the role of this acylcarnitine is presented in the context of neuronal cell metabolism and the role of acetylcarnitine in the synthesis of acetylcholine. The roles of long-chain acyl derivatives of carnitine, in particular palmitoylcarnitine, responsible for interaction with the membranes, lipids acylation and specific interactions with proteins have been summarized. Stimulation of protein palmitoylation and a possibility of changing the acylation status of G proteins is described, as well as interaction of palmitoylcarnitine with protein kinase C. Diminished interaction of the isoform δ of this kinase with GAP-43 (B-50, neuromodulin), whose expression increases upon accumulation of either carnitine or palmitoylcarnitine points to a possible regulation of differentiation by these compounds and their role in neuroregeneration.",

Distinct deficiencies arise either from genetic mutation of carnitine transporters or in association with other disorders such as liver or kidney disease. Carnitine deficiency occurs in aberrations of carnitine regulation in disorders such as diabetes, sepsis, cardiomyopathy, malnutrition, cirrhosis, endocrine disorders and with aging. Nutritional supplementation of L-carnitine, the biologically active form of carnitine, is ameliorative for uremic patients, and can improve nerve conduction, neuropathic pain and immune function in diabetes patients while it is life-saving for patients suffering primary carnitine deficiency. Clinical application of carnitine holds much promise in a range of neural disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, hepatic encephalopathy and other painful neuropathies. Topical application in dry eye offers osmoprotection and modulates immune and inflammatory responses. Carnitine has been recognized as a nutritional supplement in cardiovascular disease and there is increasing evidence that carnitine supplementation may be beneficial in treating obesity, improving glucose intolerance and total energy expenditure.",

Secondary endpoints were the effect of ALC on melancholic and negative symptoms. Sixty-four anhedonic alcohol dependent patients with minor or absent withdrawal symptoms were randomized: 23 received ALC at a dosage of 3g/day, 21 received ALC at a dosage of 1g/day, and 20 were given placebo. ALC was given intravenously for 10days, followed by 80days of oral treatment plus a follow-up period of 45days. The presence of anhedonic symptoms was determined by the SHAPS (Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale) and the VASa (Visual Analogue Scale for Anhedonia); negative and melancholic symptoms were evaluated by the SANS (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and the BRMS (Bech–Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale). The natural course of anhedonia in the placebo group showed a decline until day 30 and remains stable for the rest of the study. Intravenously ALC accelerated the improvement of anhedonia reaching constant low levels early, on day 10. At this step levels of anhedonia (SHAPS, VASa) and melancholic symptoms (BRMES) resulted significantly reduced (p<0.05) in both the ALC 3g and ALC 1g groups with respect to placebo; SANS scores significantly reduced only in the ALC 1g respect to placebo (p=0.014). During oral treatment with ALC, anhedonia scores did not differ from placebo. Intravenously ALC was effective in accelerating the abstinence-associated improvement of anhedonia, melancholic and negative symptoms, whereas oral ALC treatment starting on day 10 showed no further improvements. Accordingly, in alcohol dependent subjects, ALC may be considered as a new potentially useful drug for the treatment of anhedonia.",

		"abstract": "Background: Fatigue is frequently reported in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and may be related to hyperammonemia. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) offers neuroprotective benefits and improves mitochondrial energetics and function.\nObjective: This study evaluated the effect of exogenous ALC on physical and mental fatigue, fatigue severity, and physical activity in patients with mild and moderate hepatoencephalopathy (HE1 and HE2, respectively).\nDesign: A total of 121 patients with overt HE were recruited to the study and were subdivided into 2 groups according to their initial HE grade [HE1 (n = 61) or HE2 (n = 60)]. Thirty-one patients with HE1 and 30 with HE2 received 2 g ALC, and 30 patients with HE1 and 30 patients with HE2 received placebo twice a day for 90 d. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessments and automated electroencephalogram analysis.\nResults: At the end of the study period, the ALC-treated patients in the HE1 group showed significantly better improvement than did the placebo group in mental fatigue score (−1.7 compared with −0.3; P < 0.05), the fatigue severity scale (−6.4 compared with 2.3; P < 0.001), 7-d Physical Activity Recall questionnaire score (17.1 compared with −2.5; P < 0.001), and Short Physical Performance Battery (2.1 compared with 0.2; P < 0.001); the HE2 group showed significantly better improvement in the fatigue severity scale (−8.1 compared with −5.1; P < 0.001) and 6-min walk test (19.9 compared with 2.3; P < 0.05). Significant decreases in NH4+ were observed in both groups (P < 0.001).\nConclusion: Patients with HE treated with ALC showed a decrease in the severity of both mental and physical fatigue and an increase in physical activity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01223742.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nEvidence shows that alcohol intake causes oxidative neuronal injury and neurocognitive deficits that are distinct from the classical Wernicke-Korsakoff neuropathy. Our previous findings indicated that alcohol-elicited blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage leads to neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. The dynamic function of the BBB requires a constant supply and utilization of glucose. Here we examined whether interference of glucose uptake and transport at the endothelium by alcohol leads to BBB dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.\n\nMaterial and methods\nWe tested the hypothesis in cell culture of human brain endothelial cells, neurons and alcohol intake in animal by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and glucose uptake assay methods.\n\nResults\nWe found that decrease in glucose uptake correlates the reduction of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) in cell culture after 50 mM ethanol exposure. Decrease in GLUT1 protein levels was regulated at the translation process. In animal, chronic alcohol intake suppresses the transport of glucose into the frontal and occipital regions of the brain. This finding is validated by a marked decrease in GLUT1 protein expression in brain microvessel (the BBB). In parallel, alcohol intake impairs the BBB tight junction proteins occludin, zonula occludens-1, and claudin-5 in the brain microvessel. Permeability of sodium fluorescein and Evans Blue confirms the leakiness of the BBB. Further, depletion of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of the cell monolayer supports the disruption of BBB integrity. Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine (a neuroprotective agent) significantly prevents the adverse effects of alcohol on glucose uptake, BBB damage and neuronal degeneration.\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that alcohol-elicited inhibition of glucose transport at the blood-brain interface leads to BBB malfunction and neurological complications.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamine is absorbed in the intestinal tract coupled with sodium and is the principal metabolic substrate for the enterocyte. Therefore, an oral rehydration solution containing this substance might provide an effective oral means of restoring electrolyte losses as well as speeding repair of mucosal damage. The objective of this work was to investigate the use of an oral rehydration solution based on glutamine in vivo in the perfused rabbit ileal loop model of secretory diarrhea induced by choleratoxin.\nMETHODS: Phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP, 50 mg/l) was used as a nonabsorbable marker for calculations of net water and electrolyte transport. Solutions tested included: (a) a glutamine-based oral rehydration solution with 111 mmol/l glutamine, (Gln-ORS); (b) the oral rehydration solution recommended by the World Health Organization; (c) modified Ringer's solution. Choleratoxin (1 microg/ml) was injected into the lumen of the ileal rabbit segments for 30 minutes prior to the initiation of the perfusion.\nRESULTS: Choleratoxin induced significant secretion of sodium in the control modified Ringer's solution (10.8 +/- 2.95 vs -14.05 +/- 5.95 microEq/g/min, n = 10; p < 0.01) and of water (0.06 +/- 0.03 vs -0.15 +/- 0.06 ml/g/min, n = 10; p < 0.01) with a maximum effect at 60 minutes after initiation of perfusion. World Health Organization oral rehydration solution was able to significantly reduce the intestinal secretion of sodium (control with cholera = -14.34 +/- 2.18 vs oral rehydration solution with cholera = -0.50 +/- 0.48 microEq/g/min, n = 10; p < 0.01) and water (-0.15 +/- 0.02 vs -0.012 +/- 0.005 ml/g/min, n = 10; p < 0.01). For comparison, glutamine-based oral rehydration solution had an even greater effect on sodium and water absorption (glutamine-based oral rehydration solution with choleratoxin = 10.31 +/- 1.21 microEq/g/min, n = 5; p < 0.01 for sodium and 0.08 +/- 0.008 ml water/g/min; n = 5; p < 0.01). Choleratoxin did not change the effect of glutamine-based oral rehydration solution on sodium and water absorption (12.90 +/- -1.09 microEq sodium/g/min, n = 5; and 0.11 +/- 0.01 ml water/g/min; n = 5). In addition glutamine-based oral rehydration solution also induced a greater absorption of potassium and chloride in the intestinal ileal segments treated with choleratoxin compared with World Health Organization glutamine-based oral rehydration solution.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the superior efficacy of glutamine-based oral rehydration solution in electrolyte and water absorption compared with modified Ringer's control solution or even with World Health Organization-recommended oral rehydration solution.",

We compared the metabolic fates of highly digestible cornstarch (DCS), Hylon VII (type 2 resistant starch), and Novelose 330 (type 3 resistant starch), which are of corn origin and, therefore, naturally enriched in 13C.\nDesign: After administration of 40 g starch or glucose to 7 healthy volunteers, glucose and exogenous glucose concentrations in serum and 13CO2 excretion in breath were analyzed for 6 h. 13C abundance in carbon dioxide was analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and 13C abundance in glucose by gas chromatography–combustion IRMS.\nResults: By comparing the area under the curve (2 h) of exogenous glucose concentration in serum (13C glycemic index) after intake of starch or glucose, 13C glycemic indexes for DCS, Hylon VII, and Novelose 330 were calculated to be 82 ± 23%, 44 ± 16%, and 43 ± 15%, respectively. Comparison of 6-h cumulative percentage dose recovery in breath showed that 119 ± 28% of DCS, 55 ± 23% of Hylon VII, and 50 ± 26% of Novelose 330 was digested in the small intestine.\nConclusion: The exogenous glucose response in serum and the 13CO2 excretion in breath can be used to estimate small intestinal digestion of resistant starch, which amounts to ≈50%.",

		"abstract": "In a randomized double-blind, cross-over experiment, 0.5 g/kg of ethanol in the form of white wine and 3 g of L-carnitine by intravenous infusion were administered to 15 healthy volunteers. Ethanol and acetate plasma levels and the urine concentrations of acetylcarnitine were determined. Administration of ethanol induced a significant increase of both plasma ethanol and acetate, lasting 6–8 hr. The concomitant administration of carnitine resulted in a significant decrease of plasma acetate, whereas plasma ethanol levels remained unmodified. Urinary acetylcarnitine content significantly increased following administration of ethanol plus carnitine, but not when L-carnitine alone was administered. The resulting conclusion is that administered L-carnitine might trap excess acetyls derived both from free acetate, formed by ethanol oxidation, and from acetyl coenzyme A, accumulated as a result of the ethanol-induced decrease in the Krebs cycle flux.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol consumption causes neurocognitive deficits, neuronal injury, and neurodegeneration. At the cellular level, alcohol abuse causes oxidative damage to mitochondria and cellular proteins and interlink with the progression of neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. We previously reported that alcohol inhibits glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to BBB dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that ethanol (EtOH)-mediated disruption in glucose uptake would deprive energy for human astrocytes and neurons inducing neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. EtOH may also have a direct effect on glucose uptake in neurons and astrocytes, which has not been previously described. Our results indicate that ethanol exposure decreases the uptake of D-(2-3H)-glucose by human astrocytes and neurons. Inhibition of glucose uptake correlates with a reduction in glucose transporter protein expression (GLUT1 in astrocytes and GLUT3 in neurons). Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a neuroprotective agent, suppresses the effects of alcohol on glucose uptake and GLUT levels, thus reducing neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. These findings suggest that deprivation of glucose in brain cells contributes to neurotoxicity in alcohol abusers, and highlights ALC as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent the deleterious health conditions caused by alcohol abuse.",

		"abstract": "Neuropathy and neurocognitive deficits are common among chronic alcohol users, which are believed to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. The specific type of brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (mRCC) that are adversely affected by alcohol abuse has not been studied. Thus, we examined the alterations of mRCC in freshly isolated mitochondria from mice brain that were pair-fed the ethanol (4% v/v) and control liquid diets for 7–8 weeks. We observed that alcohol intake severely reduced the levels of complex I and V. A reduction in complex I was associated with a decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cPT1) and cPT2 levels. The mitochondrial outer (cPT1) and inner (cPT2) membrane transporter enzymes are specialized in acylation of fatty acid from outer to inner membrane of mitochondria for ATP production. Thus, our results showed that alterations of cPT1 and cPT2 paralleled a decrease β-oxidation of palmitate and ATP production, suggesting that impairment of substrate entry step (complex I function) can cause a negative impact on ATP production (complex V function). Disruption of cPT1/cPT2 was accompanied by an increase in cytochrome C leakage, while reduction of complex I and V paralleled a decrease in depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ, monitored by JC-1 fluorescence) and ATP production in alcohol intake. We noted that acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC, a cofactor of cPT1 and cPT2) prevented the adverse effects of alcohol while coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was not very effective against alcohol insults. These results suggest that understanding the molecular, biochemical, and signaling mechanisms of the CNS mitochondrial β-oxidation such as ALC can mitigate alcohol related neurological disorders.",

The activity of ADH, not MEOS, was significantly inhibited by acetylcarnitine at NAD : acetylcarnitine ≤ 1. The inhibition is of a competitive nature where acetylcarnitine competes with NAD+ (Ki = 135 μmol.L−1).

Although carnitine retards ethanol oxidation in the intact animal, the in vitro activities of ethainol-metabolizing enzymes remain unaltered. Therefore, hepatocytes were targeted to understand the mechanism of carnitine effect on ethanol metabolism. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase-perfusion technique and incubated in albumin-containing medium with ethanol in the presence or absence of added carnitine or related compounds. Ethanol oxidation was determined by the loss of ethanol as well as by the products formed. The rate of ethanol oxidation in the presence of carnitine was one-half the rate in the absence of carnitine (14 vs. 25 nmol · min−1 · million−1 cells). It took 100 times the concentration of carnitine to equal the maximal inhibition produced by acetylcarnitine and the effect of acetylcanitine was without a lag time. It is concluded that acetylcarnitine is the mediator of carnitine inhibition of ethanol oxidation.",

		"abstract": "The studies presented here demonstrate the protective effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) against alcohol-induced oxidative neuroinflammation, neuronal degeneration, and impaired neurotransmission. Our findings reveal the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of alcohol-induced oxidative damage in various types of brain cells. Chronic ethanol administration to mice caused an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 3-nitrotyrosine adduct formation in frontal cortical neurons but not in astrocytes from brains of these animals. Interestingly, alcohol administration caused a rather selective activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), which, in turn, enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxynonenal, but these were predominantly localized in astrocytes and microglia. Oxidative damage in glial cells was accompanied by their pronounced activation (astrogliosis) and coincident neuronal loss, suggesting that inflammation in glial cells caused neuronal degeneration. Immunohistochemistry studies indicated that alcohol consumption induced different oxidative mediators in different brain cell types. Thus, nitric oxide was mostly detected in iNOS-expressing neurons, whereas ROS were predominantly generated in NOX-expressing glial cells after alcohol ingestion. Assessment of neuronal activity in ex vivo frontal cortical brain tissue slices from ethanol-fed mice showed a reduction in long-term potentiation synaptic transmission compared with slices from controls. Coadministration of ALC with alcohol showed a significant reduction in oxidative damage and neuronal loss and a restoration of synaptic neurotransmission in this brain region, suggesting that ALC protects brain cells from ethanol-induced oxidative injury. These findings suggest the potential clinical utility of ALC as a neuroprotective agent that prevents alcohol-induced brain damage and development of neurological disorders.",

		"abstract": "Oxidative damage of the endothelium disrupts the integrity of blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown before that alcohol exposure increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS, superoxide and hydroxyl radical) and nitric oxide (NO) in brain endothelial cells by activating NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase. We hypothesize that impairment of anti-oxidant systems like reduction of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in ethanol exposure may elevate the levels of ROS/NO in endothelium resulting in BBB damage. The present study examines whether stabilization of antioxidant enzyme activity results in suppression of ROS levels by anti-inflammatory agents. To address this idea, we determined the effects of ethanol on the kinetic profile of SOD and catalase activity and ROS/NO generation in primary human brain endothelial cells (hBECs). We observed an enhanced production of ROS and NO levels due to the metabolism of ethanol in hBECs. Similar increases were found after exposure of hBECs to acetaldehyde, the major metabolite of ethanol. Ethanol simultaneously augmented ROS generation and activity of anti-oxidative enzymes. SOD activity was increased for a much longer period of time as compared to catalase activity. Decline in SOD activity and protein levels preceded elevation of oxidant levels. SOD stabilization by the mitochondria protecting agent, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), and anti-inflammatory agent, rosiglitazone, suppressed ROS levels with marginal increase in NO levels. Mitochondrial membrane protein damage and decreased membrane potential after ethanol exposure indicated mitochondrial injury. These changes were prevented by ALC. Our findings suggest the counteracting mechanisms of oxidants and anti-oxidants during alcohol-induced oxidative stress at the BBB. The presence of enzymatic stabilizers favors the ROS neutralizing anti-oxidant redox of the BBB, suggesting an underlying protective mechanism of NO for brain vascular tone and vasodilation.",

In the current study we measured FAEE formation in rats after short-term oral administration of ethanol, in the presence and absence of pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine. Ethanol treatment caused a significant increase in the levels of FAEE, particularly in the brain and heart, but also in the kidney and liver. Increases in FAEE were associated with a significant increase in FAEE synthase activity, GSH transferase activity, and lipid hydroperoxide levels. Pre-treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine resulted in a significant reduction of FAEE accumulation, decrease in FAEE synthase and GSH transferase activities, and lipid hydroperoxide levels. Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine greatly reduced the metabolic abnormalities due to non-oxidative ethanol metabolism, through an increment in lipid metabolism/turnover and by the modulation of the activities of enzymes associated with FAEE synthesis. These results suggest a potentially important pharmacological role for acetyl-L-carnitine in the prevention of alcohol-induced cellular damage.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcoholism is a major public health problem and causes multiorgan diseases and toxicity. Although the majority of ethanol ingested is metabolized by the liver, it has intoxicating effects in the brain. Evidence is accumulating that intermediates of oxygen reduction may be associated with the development of alcoholic disease. Several studies have shown the capacity of carnitine and its derivatives to influence ethanol metabolism. We have previously demonstrated that preadministration of L-carnitine to rats receiving ethanol significantly reduced fatty acid ethyl esters in different organs and that the carnitine/acylcarnitine system is crucial for maintaining a functional acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio under conditions in which cellular homeostasis is exposed to the deleterious effects of accumulating organic acids. Ethanol, administered to rats for 20 months, induced significant changes in the status of glutathione, primarily in the brain regions of hippocampus and cerebellum, followed by cortex and striatum, where a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio was found. The same brain regions showed a significant increase in free radical-induced luminescence and hydroxynonenal (HNE), which were associated with decreased GSH reductase activity. Long-term supplementation with acetyl carnitine significantly reduced GSH depletion, particularly in the brain regions of hippocampus, an effect associated with decreased luminescence and HNE formation. In addition, acetyl carnitine treatment increased GSH reductase and arginase activities. Our results indicate that decreased GSH reductase activities associated with thiol depletion are important factors sustaining a pathogenic role in alcohol-related pathologies. Administration of acetyl carnitine greatly reduces these metabolic abnormalities. This evidence supports the pharmacological potential of acetyl carnitine in the management of alcoholic disturbances.",

		"abstract": "We have investigated in the current study the possible protective effects of two carnitine esters known to have powerful anti-oxidant potential namely, propionyl l-carnitine (PLC) and acetyl l-carnitine (AC) against alcohol-induced gastric lesions in rats. Both drugs were administered as a single oral dose of 200mgkg−1 body weight 1h before alcohol intake. Both carnitine esters could protect the gastric mucosa against the injurious effect of absolute alcohol and promote ulcer healing as evidenced from the ulcer index (UI) values. Propionyl l-carnitine prevented alcohol-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation. The propionyl carnitine ester also increased the gastric content of reduced glutathione (GSH), besides it increased the enzymatic activities of gastric superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Likewise, AC did protect against the ulcerating effect of alcohol and mitigate most of the biochemical adverse effects induced by alcohol in gastric mucosa, but to a lesser extent than PLC. Neither PLC nor AC did affect catalase activity in gastric tissue. Based on these observations, one could conclude that carnitine esters, particularly PLC could partly protect gastric mucosa from alcohol-induced acute mucosal injury, and these gastroprotective effects might be probably induced, at least partly, through anti-oxidant mechanisms.",

All the agents prevented oxidative stress and MDA/4HNE formation induced by ethanol, except for EGCG. Catechin prevented CYP2E1 induction by ethanol. All the agents tended to down regulate the ethanol-induced increased expression of glutathionine peroxidase 4 (GPX4). All the agents, except catechin, tended to reduce the expression of SOD2 induced by ethanol. Heat shock protein 70 was up regulated by ethanol alone and betaine tended to prevent this. All 4 agents down regulated the expression of Gadd45b in the presence of ethanol, which could explain the mechanism of DNA demethylation associated with the up regulation of the gene expression observed in experimental ALD. In conclusion, the in vitro model of oxidative stress induced by ethanol provided evidence that all 4 agents tested prevented some aspect of liver cell injury caused by ethanol.",

		"abstract": "In the past, alcoholic liver disease was attributed exclusively to dietary deficiencies, but experimental and judicious clinical studies have now established alcohol's hepatotoxicity. Despite an adequate diet, it can contribute to the entire spectrum of liver diseases, mainly by generating oxidative stress through its microsomal metabolism via cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1). It also interferes with nutrient activation, resulting in changes in nutritional requirements. This is exemplified by methionine, one of the essential amino acids for humans, which needs to be activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a process impaired by liver disease. Thus, SAMe rather than methionine is the compound that must be supplemented in the presence of significant liver disease. In baboons, SAMe attenuated mitochondrial lesions and replenished glutathione; it also significantly reduced mortality in patients with Child A or B cirrhosis. Similarly, decreased phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase activity is associated with alcoholic liver disease, resulting in phosphatidylcholine depletion and serious consequences for the integrity of membranes. This can be offset by polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC), a mixture of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines comprising dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), which has high bioavailability. PPC (and DLPC) opposes major toxic effects of alcohol, with down-regulation of CYP2E1 and reduction of oxidative stress, deactivation of hepatic stellate cells, and increased collagenase activity, which in baboons, results in prevention of ethanol-induced septal fibrosis and cirrhosis. Corresponding clinical trials are ongoing.",

		"abstract": "Oxidative stress is suggested to play a key role in the development of alcoholic liver injury. We investigated the induction of oxidative damage in association with changes in hepatic concentrations of sulfur-containing substances in mice challenged with binge-like ethanol administration. Also the protective effect of dietary betaine against ethanol-induced liver injury was determined. Serum alanine aminotransferase activity, TNFalpha level, and hepatic malondialdehyde level were increased significantly by ethanol administration. Hepatic Cyp2e1 was induced to 250% of control. Ethanol administration decreased hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and glutathione, but elevated hypotaurine and taurine levels. Betaine supplied in drinking water for 2 weeks attenuated the induction of alcoholic liver injury and Cyp2e1 significantly. Reduction of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and glutathione was alleviated, and elevation of hypotaurine and taurine was depressed. The results suggest that betaine may protect the liver against ethanol-induced oxidative injury most probably via its effects on the sulfur-amino acid metabolism.",

		"abstract": "Glycine prevents hepatic damage caused by hypoxia-reoxygenation, diminishes mortality due to endotoxin and minimizes alcoholic liver injury by decreasing blood ethanol. Our purpose was to investigate the effect of dietary glycine during recovery from early alcohol-induced injury, using a model that mimics the clinical presentation and histopathology with alcoholics. Male Wistar rats were exposed to ethanol continuously for 6 wk via intragastric feeding that resulted in typical histology of alcoholic liver injury, including steatosis, inflammation, necrosis and increased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. After cessation of ethanol, one group of rats received a control diet, the other a glycine-containing diet for 2 wk. During this period, all parameters studied tended to return to baseline values. However, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase recovered about 30% more rapidly in rats fed glycine. Further, the hepatic pathology score was also significantly lower in the glycine group than in controls (0.5vs. 2.6). After 1 wk, steatosis was reduced significantly more in the glycine group (5.6%) than in controls (8.9%). Glycine also diminished numbers of infiltrating leukocytes and necrotic cells significantly more than in controls. This beneficial effect of glycine may be partly explained by the fact that glycine increased influx of chloride into Kupffer cells leading to diminished tumor necrosis factor-α production. These results indicate that a glycine containing diet expedites the process of recovery from ethanol-induced liver injury and may lead to its clinical application in alcoholic hepatitis.",

After the end of drinking, at bedtime, in the following morning after waking-up, and on two further occasions during the morning and early afternoon, breath-alcohol tests were performed and samples of urine were collected for analysis of ethanol and methanol and the 5-hydroxytryptophol (5-HTOL) to 5-hydroxyindol-3-ylacetic acid (5-HIAA) ratio The participants were also asked to quantify the intensity of hangover symptoms (headache, nausea, anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue, muscle aches, vertigo) on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe symptoms). The first morning urine void collected 6-11 h after bedtime as a rule contained measurable amounts of ethanol, being 0.09 ± 0.03 g/l (mean ± SD) after 50 g and 0.38 ± 0.1 g/l after 80 g ethanol. The corresponding breath-alcohol concentrations were zero, except for three individuals who registered 0.01–0.09 g/l. Ethanol was not measurable in urine samples collected later in the morning and early afternoon. The peak urinary methanol occurred in the first morning void, when the mean concentration after 80 g ethanol was ˜ 6-fold higher than pre-drinking values. This compares with a ˜ 50-fold increase for the 5-HTOL/5-HIAA ratio in the first morning void. Both methanol and the 5-HTOL/5-HIAA ratio remained elevated above pre-drinking baseline values in the second and sometimes even the third morning voids. Most subjects experienced only mild hangover symptoms after drinking 50 g ethanol (mean score 2.4 ± 2.6), but the scores were significantly higher after drinking 80g (78 ± 7.1). The most common symptoms were headache, drowsiness, and fatigue A highly significant correlation (r = 0.62–0.75, P <0.01) was found between the presence of headache, nausea, and vertigo and the urinary methanol concentration in the first and second morning voids, whereas 5-HTOL/5-HIAA correlated with headache and nausea. These results show that analysing urinary methanol and 5-HTOL furnishes a way to disclose recent drinking after alcohol has no longer been measurable by conventional breath-alcohol tests for at least 5–10 h. The results also support the notion that methanol may be an important factor in the aetiology of hangover.",

Methods: Aiming for ecological validity, the study required participants to consume their usual quantity of any type of alcoholic beverage in their chosen company (hangover situation). However, the timing of drinking was restricted to the period between 22:00 and 02:00 hours on the night before testing. Testing included memory and psychomotor performance tests; testing was also performed after an evening of abstinence (no hangover situation), following a counterbalanced design using repeated measures, with time of testing (09:00, 11:00 and 13:00 hours) and order of testing (hangover/no hangover; no hangover/hangover) as ‘between participant’ factors in the analysis. Results: Forty-eight social drinkers (33 women, 15 men) aged between 18 and 43 years were tested, with a 1-week interval between test sessions. The morning after alcohol (mean consumption: 14.7 units for men; 10.4 units for women), free recall was impaired at 09:00 hours and delayed recognition and psychomotor performance were impaired throughout the morning, despite blood alcohol levels of zero or very near zero. Conclusion: Memory and psychomotor performance is impaired on the morning after heavy ‘social’ drinking.",

		"abstract": "Background\nThis study assessed the effects of heavy drinking with high or low congener beverages on next-day neurocognitive performance, and the extent to which these effects were mediated by alcohol-related sleep disturbance or alcoholic beverage congeners, and correlated with the intensity of hangover.\n\nMethods\nHealthy heavy drinkers age 21–33 (n = 95) participated in two drinking nights after an acclimatization night. They drank to a mean of 0.11 g% BrAC on vodka or bourbon one night with matched placebo the other night, randomized for type and order. Polysomnography recordings were made overnight; self-report and neurocognitive measures were assessed the next morning.\n\nResults\nAfter alcohol, people had more hangover and more decrements in tests requiring both sustained attention and speed. Hangover correlated with poorer performance on these measures. Alcohol decreased sleep efficiency and REM sleep, and increased wake time and next-day sleepiness. Alcohol effects on sleep correlated with hangover but did not mediate the effects on performance. No effect of beverage congeners was found except on hangover severity, with people feeling worse after bourbon. Virtually no sex differences appeared.\n\nConclusions\nSince drinking to this level affects complex cognitive abilities, safety could be affected, with implications for driving and for safety sensitive occupations. Congener content affects only how people feel the next day so does not increase risk. The sleep disrupting effects of alcohol did not account for the impaired performance so other mechanisms of effect need to be sought. Since hangover symptoms correlate with impaired performance, these might be contributing to the impairment.",

		"abstract": "Abstract.  The effects of fructose and glucose on the metabolic changes induced by ethanol and on the intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover were studied in 109 healthy male volunteers. After 10 hours of fasting, the subjects were given 1.75 g of ethanol per kg body wt during 3 hours under controlled laboratory conditions. Fructose or glucose were administered either simultaneously with ethanol or 12 hours later during the hangover period. The intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover were estimated 10 times during the experimental period of 20 hours using subjective and objective rating scales. Sequential determinations of blood ethanol, acetaldehyde, glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, triglycerides, ketone bodies and capillary blood acid-base balance were also made during the experiment. Under these experimental conditions neither fructose nor glucose had any significant effect on the intensity of alcohol intoxication and hangover. The sugars also had no significant effect on the rate of ethanol elimination or on the blood acetaldehyde concentration during the course of the experiment. Blood glucose concentration was decreased and blood lactate, free fatty acid and ketone body concentrations were increased during the hangover period in the subjects who had been given only ethanol. These subjects also had a marked metabolic acidosis during hangover. Glucose and fructose significantly inhibited the metabolic alterations induced by ethanol. In this respect fructose was more effective than glucose. The results indicate that both fructose and glucose effectively inhibit the metabolic disturbances induced by ethanol but they do not affect the symptoms or signs of alcohol intoxication and hangover. The results support the view that hangover is not directly related to the metabolic effects of ethanol or to its metabolic products.",

The present study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to examine the temporal relationships between drinking and hangovers and how this varied by age and sex. We hypothesized that alcohol’s dose-dependent effects on hangover severity are more pronounced among adolescents and young adults than older drinkers. We also explored whether greater hangover severity would lead to a lower likelihood and volume of alcohol use later the same day. Data were pooled from four studies of drinkers (N = 274; ages 15 to 66 years) who completed a 4- to 14-day (M = 7.46, SD = 1.13) EMA monitoring period. Each morning, participants recorded how much alcohol they consumed the day before and rated their hangover severity. Participants who consumed a greater quantity of alcohol the prior day reported more severe hangover symptoms; however, there was an interaction between drinking volume and age such that hangover was more severe among younger drinkers, especially at higher drinking levels. More severe hangover symptoms did not predict the likelihood of drinking later that day; however, on drinking days more severe hangover symptoms predicted lower quantities of alcohol use later that day. This event-level effect did not vary as a function of age. Study outcomes did not vary by sex. Our findings suggest that younger drinkers experience more severe hangovers and that greater hangover results in lighter drinking later that same day regardless of age.",

		"abstract": "Aim : The gastrointestinal transit of sequentially administered capsules was investigated in relation to the availability of fluid along the intestinal lumen by magnetic resonance imaging. Methods : Water-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 12 healthy subjects during fasting and 1 h after a meal. Specifiable non-disintegrating capsules were administered at 7, 4 and 1 h prior to imaging. Results : While food intake reduced the mean fluid volumes in the small intestine (105 ± 72 mL vs. 54 ± 41 mL, P < 0.01) it had no significant effect on the mean fluid volumes in the colon (13 ± 12 mL vs. 18 ± 26 mL). The mean number of separated fluid pockets increased in both organs after meal (small intestine: 4 vs. 6, P < 0.05; large intestine: 4 vs. 6, P < 0.05). The distribution of capsules between the small and large intestine was strongly influenced by food (colon: 3 vs. 17 capsules, P < 0.01). Conclusions : The results show that fluid is not homogeneously distributed along the gut, which likely contributes to the individual variability of drug absorption. Furthermore, transport of fluid and solids through the ileocaecal valve is obviously initiated by a meal-induced gastro-ileocaecal reflex.",

		"abstract": "The current study was performed to investigate the effect of naringin supplements on the alcohol, lipid, and antioxidant metabolism in ethanol-treated rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10) based on six dietary categories: ethanol and naringin-free, ethanol (50 g/L) plus low-naringin (0.05 g/L), ethanol plus high-naringin (0.125 g/L), and three corresponding pair-fed groups. The pair-fed control rats received an isocaloric diet containing dextrin-maltose instead of ethanol for 5 wks. Among the ethanol treated groups, the naringin supplements significantly lowered the plasma ethanol concentration with a simultaneous increase in the ADH and/or ALDH activities. However, among the ethanol-treated groups, naringin supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in the hepatic triglycerides and plasma and hepatic total cholesterol compared to that in the naringin-free group. Naringin supplementation significantly increased the HDL-cholesterol and HDL-C/total-C ratio, while lowering the AI value among the ethanol-treated groups. Hepatic lipid accumulation was also significantly reduced in the naringin-supplemented groups compared to the naringin-free group among the ethanol-treated groups, while no differences were found among the pair-fed groups. Among the ethanol-treated groups, the low-naringin supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of plasma and hepatic TBARS, whereas it resulted in higher SOD and GSH-Px activities and gluthathion levels in the liver. Accordingly, naringin would appear to contribute to alleviating the adverse effect of ethanol ingestion by enhancing the ethanol and lipid metabolism as well as the hepatic antioxidant defense system.",

The plasma ethanol concentrations were 154 ± 18, 231 ± 53, and 268 ± 49 mg/dl 1 h after oral ethanol doses of 2, 4, and 6 g/kg, respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (71%, 56%, and 41% of control) and glutathione reductase (GR) (71%, 66%, and 55% of control) activity in plasma were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Catalase (CAT)/SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)/SOD ratios were significantly increased whereas GR/GSH-Px ratio was significantly decreased with increasing dose of ethanol. In a time course study, plasma ethanol concentrations were 177± 9.7, 143± 11, 99± 17, and 26± 11 mg/dl at 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 h after an oral dose (4 g/kg) of ethanol in rat indicating time-dependent elimination of ethanol. Plasma SOD and GSH-Px activity significantly increased 4–6 h whereas GR activity significantly decreased 2–4 h after ethanol ingestion. The ratio of GR/GSH-Px and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in plasma decreased at 1.5–6 h after ethanol ingestion. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly elevated with respect to an increase in time after ethanol ingestion, indicating time-dependent augmentation of lipid peroxidation. The data indicate that ethanol ingestion perturbs the plasma antioxidant system in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The significant changes in the ratios of CAT/SOD, GSH-Px/SOD, GR/GSH-Px, and GSH/GSSG in plasma may be used as an index of alcohol-induced oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by living organisms as a result of normal cellular metabolism and environmental factors, such as air pollutants or cigarette smoke. ROS are highly reactive molecules and can damage cell structures such as carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins and alter their functions. The shift in the balance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of oxidants is termed “oxidative stress.” Regulation of reducing and oxidizing (redox) state is critical for cell viability, activation, proliferation, and organ function. Aerobic organisms have integrated antioxidant systems, which include enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants that are usually effective in blocking harmful effects of ROS. However, in pathological conditions, the antioxidant systems can be overwhelmed. Oxidative stress contributes to many pathological conditions and diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/perfusion, diabetes, acute respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. In this review, we summarize the cellular oxidant and antioxidant systems and discuss the cellular effects and mechanisms of the oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention toward the field of free radical chemistry. Free radicals reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are generated by our body by various endogenous systems, exposure to different physiochemical conditions or pathological states. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is necessary for proper physiological function. If free radicals overwhelm the body's ability to regulate them, a condition known as oxidative stress ensues. Free radicals thus adversely alter lipids, proteins, and DNA and trigger a number of human diseases. Hence application of external source of antioxidants can assist in coping this oxidative stress. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole have recently been reported to be dangerous for human health. Thus, the search for effective, nontoxic natural compounds with antioxidative activity has been intensified in recent years. The present review provides a brief overview on oxidative stress mediated cellular damages and role of dietary antioxidants as functional foods in the management of human diseases.",

		"abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS) in brain is located mainly in astrocytes. One of the primary roles of astrocytes is to protect neurons against excitotoxicity by taking up excess ammonia and glutamate and converting it into glutamine via the enzyme GS. Changes in GS expression may reflect changes in astroglial function, which can affect neuronal functions.\nHyperammonemia is an important factor responsible of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and causes astroglial swelling. Hyperammonemia can be experimentally induced and an adaptive astroglial response to high levels of ammonia and glutamate seems to occur in long-term studies. In hyperammonemic states, astroglial cells can experience morphological changes that may alter different astrocyte functions, such as protein synthesis or neurotransmitters uptake. One of the observed changes is the increase in the GS expression in astrocytes located in glutamatergic areas. The induction of GS expression in these specific areas would balance the increased ammonia and glutamate uptake and protect against neuronal degeneration, whereas, decrease of GS expression in non-glutamatergic areas could disrupt the neuron-glial metabolic interactions as a consequence of hyperammonemia.\nInduction of GS has been described in astrocytes in response to the action of glutamate on active glutamate receptors. The over-stimulation of glutamate receptors may also favour nitric oxide (NO) formation by activation of NO synthase (NOS), and NO has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several CNS diseases. Hyperammonemia could induce the formation of inducible NOS in astroglial cells, with the consequent NO formation, deactivation of GS and dawn-regulation of glutamate uptake. However, in glutamatergic areas, the distribution of both glial glutamate receptors and glial glutamate transporters parallels the GS location, suggesting a functional coupling between glutamate uptake and degradation by glutamate transporters and GS to attenuate brain injury in these areas.\nIn hyperammonemia, the astroglial cells located in proximity to blood-vessels in glutamatergic areas show increased GS protein content in their perivascular processes. Since ammonia freely crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and astrocytes are responsible for maintaining the BBB, the presence of GS in the perivascular processes could produce a rapid glutamine synthesis to be released into blood. It could, therefore, prevent the entry of high amounts of ammonia from circulation to attenuate neurotoxicity. The changes in the distribution of this critical enzyme suggests that the glutamate–glutamine cycle may be differentially impaired in hyperammonemic states.",

		"abstract": "The effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the bowel flora and the potential therapeutic role of probiotics in alcohol-induced liver injury have not previously been evaluated. In this study, sixty-six adult Russian males admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholic psychosis were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial to study the effects of alcohol and probiotics on the bowel flora and alcohol-induced liver injury. Patients were randomized to receive 5 days of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum 8PA3 vs. standard therapy alone (abstinence plus vitamins). Stool cultures and liver enzymes were performed at baseline and again after therapy. Results were compared between groups and with 24 healthy, matched controls who did not consume alcohol. Compared to healthy controls, alcoholic patients had significantly reduced numbers of bifidobacteria (6.3 vs. 7.5 log CFU/g), lactobacilli (3.15 vs. 4.59 log CFU/g), and enterococci (4.43 vs. 5.5 log CFU/g). The mean baseline AST, ALT and GGT activities were significantly elevated in the alcoholic group when compared to the healthy control group (AST: 104.1 vs. 29.15 U/L; ALT: 50.49 vs. 22.96 U/L; GGT 161.5 vs. 51.88 U/L) indicating that these patients did have mild alcohol-induced liver injury. After 5 days of probiotic therapy, alcoholic patients had significantly increased numbers of both bifidobacteria (7.9 vs. 6.81 log CFU/g) and lactobacilli (4.2 vs. 3.2 log CFU/g) when compared to the standard therapy arm. Despite similar values at study initiation, patients treated with probiotics had significantly lower AST and ALT activity at the end of treatment than those treated with standard therapy alone (AST: 54.67 vs. 76.43 U/L; ALT 36.69 vs. 51.26 U/L). In a subgroup of 26 subjects with well-characterized mild alcoholic hepatitis (defined as AST and ALT greater than 30 U/L with AST to ALT ratio greater than one), probiotic therapy was associated with a significant end of treatment reduction in ALT, AST, GGT, LDH and total bilirubin. In this subgroup, there was a significant end of treatment mean ALT reduction in the probiotic arm vs. the standard therapy arm. In conclusion, patients with alcohol-induced liver injury have altered bowel flora when compared to healthy controls. Short-term oral supplementation with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum 8PA3 was associated with restoration of the bowel flora and greater improvement in alcohol-induced liver injury than standard therapy alone.",

		"abstract": "SummaryBackgroundAntioxidant defence has been reported to decrease, and oxidative stress to increase, after oral glucose loading in both normal and diabetic subjects. If confirmed in normal subjects, glucose–induced antioxidant depletion has important implications for health in relation to the modern, sugar–rich diet.Aim of the studyTo investigate changes in plasma biomarkers of oxidant:antioxidant balance in non–diabetic subjects following oral glucose loading. Baseline inter–relationships between biomarkers of glycaemic control, oxidant:antioxidant balance and inflammation were also explored.MethodsA singleblinded, placebo–controlled, crossover intervention trial involving 10 healthy, consenting subjects. Venous blood was collected after ingestion of 75 g glucose in 300 mL water, or of water alone. Blood was collected at 0 time (fasting) and 30, 60, 90, 120 min post–ingestion. Within 2 weeks the procedure was repeated with volunteers crossedover onto the other treatment. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (as the FRAP value), ascorbic acid, α–tocopherol, uric acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), allantoin and high sensitivity C–reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose and insulin, were measured in all samples. Paired results post–glucose and post–water at each time interval were compared using the Wilcoxon matched–pairs signed–ranks test.ResultsNormal glucose tolerance was observed in all subjects, although, as expected, plasma glucose and insulin increased significantly (p < 0.05, n = 10) after glucose loading. Post–glucose responses in plasma FRAP and the individual antioxidants tested were not significantly different to the responses seen post–water, although both FRAP and α–tocopherol decreased slightly. Neither were postglucose changes in plasma MDA and allantoin, putative biomarkers of oxidative stress, significantly different to those after intake of water alone. Plasma FRAP and α-tocopherol also decreased slightly, but not significantly, after intake of water. A significant direct correlation (r = 0.867, p < 0.001, n = 10) was found between fasting allantoin and (log transformed) hsCRP concentrations.ConclusionsThese new data from a controlled intervention trial indicate that acute, transient increases in plasma glucose following oral intake of a large glucose load do not, as previously reported, cause a significant decrease in plasma antioxidants or increase oxidative stress in non–diabetic subjects. This is reassuring given the large quantities of sugar ingested by children and adolescents. However, a small decrease in plasma antioxidant capacity was seen after ingestion of water and of glucose, and it is possible that intake of glucose without concomitant intake of antioxidants in susceptible individuals may cause oxidative stress. Further work is needed in relation to diabetic subjects and a possible glucose threshold for this. The finding of a direct relationship between allantoin, a biomarker of oxidative stress, and hsCRP, a marker of inflammation and CHD predictor, in healthy subjects is interesting and indicates a link between sub–clinical inflammation and oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol has been reported to have appetite-stimulating properties in humans. The underlying mechanism is unknown. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY), could be involved as mediators of the alcohol effect because ghrelin stimulates the appetite and PYY appears to induce satiety. This investigation was undertaken with the intention to study that issue. Twelve young and healthy volunteers of both sexes participated in 2 experiments (experiments A and B), which were performed in random order 1 week apart. Alcohol (0.55 g ethanol per kilogram) was ingested in experiment A, drinking water in experiment B. Venous blood samples were collected before and repeatedly after the drinks. Serum concentrations of total ghrelin, octanoylated ghrelin (the bioactive form of the hormone), PYY, and ethanol were determined over a period of 5 hours. In experiment A, the ethanol level increased from 0 to 12.5 ± 0.7 mmol/L in 1 hour (P < .001), and then began to decrease. In experiment B, the ethanol level remained at zero throughout the entire experiment. Alcohol induced significant declines in total and octanoylated ghrelin concentrations from 30 minutes on. The total ghrelin level reached its lowest point 5 hours after the alcohol intake (36% ± 4% below the basal level; P < .001). The octanoylated ghrelin level fell 48% ± 5% below the basal level in 2 hours (P < .001) and then tended to level out. Drinking water left both total and octanoylated ghrelin levels unaffected. The PYY level remained unchanged after both alcohol and water ingestion. Alcohol has a strong inhibitory influence on human ghrelin secretion, but has no effect on circulating PYY levels. This makes it unlikely that the orexigenic effect of alcohol is mediated by either of these 2 hormones.",

		"abstract": "Aims/hypothesis\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether moderate alcohol consumption increases plasma high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and/or muscle oxidative capacity.\n\nMaterials and methods\nEleven lean (BMI 18–25 kg/m2) and eight overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) men consumed 100 ml whisky (∼32 g alcohol) or water daily for 4 weeks in a randomised, controlled, crossover trial. After each treatment period, muscle biopsies and fasting blood samples were collected.\n\nResults\nAdiponectin concentrations increased (p < 0.001) by 12.5% after 4 weeks of moderate alcohol consumption. Moderate alcohol consumption tended to increase HMW adiponectin by 57% (p = 0.07) and medium molecular weight adiponectin by 12.5% (p = 0.07), but not low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin. Skeletal muscle citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase and β-3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (β-HAD) activity were not changed after moderate alcohol consumption, but an interaction between alcohol consumption and BMI was observed for cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.072) and citrate synthase (p = 0.102) activity. Among lean men, moderate alcohol consumption tended to increase cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.08) and citrate synthase activity (p = 0.12) by 23 and 26%, respectively, but not among overweight men. In particular, plasma HMW adiponectin correlated positively with activities of skeletal muscle citrate synthase (r = 0.64, p = 0.009), cytochrome c oxidase (p = 0.59, p = 0.009) and β-HAD (r = 0.46, p = 0.056), while such correlation was not present for LMW adiponectin. Whole-body insulin sensitivity and intramyocellular triacylglycerol content were not affected by moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nConclusions/interpretation\nModerate alcohol consumption increases adiponectin concentrations, and in particular HMW adiponectin. Concentrations of HMW adiponectin in particular were positively associated with skeletal muscle oxidative capacity.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVES--To evaluate the effects of moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages on the fibrinolytic system and to assess whether these effects could help explain the relation between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced coronary heart disease. DESIGN--Four treatments were allocated in a randomised controlled order on four days over a period of 11 days. SETTING--Metabolic ward of research institute. SUBJECTS--Eight white healthy middle aged men. INTERVENTIONS--Subjects were provided with food for the 11 days. On the four study days mineral water or 40 g of alcohol in the form of beer, wine, or spirits was consumed at dinner early in the evening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, tissue type plasminogen activator antigen, and tissue type plasminogen activator activity one hour before and one, three, five, nine, and 13 hours after dinner with mineral water or alcoholic beverages. RESULTS--After dinner with alcohol plasminogen activator inhibitor activity rose from 53 (SD 19)% to a maximum of 667 (283%) five hours after dinner (P < 0.001). Tissue type plasminogen activator antigen levels rose from 5.3 (2.2) micrograms/l to a maximum of 10.8 (3.8) micrograms/l nine hours after dinner with alcohol (P < 0.001). Plasminogen activator activity was reduced in the postprandial period (from 1387 (483) IU/l to 323 (288) IU/l five hours after eating; P < 0.001) but was higher than normal early the next morning (1516 (809) IU/l after alcohol, 779 (516) IU/l after water; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION--Moderate alcohol consumption with dinner affects plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, plasminogen activator antigen level, and tissue type plasminogen activator activity temporarily. The effects observed in the early morning are consistent with a decrease in risk of coronary heart disease in moderate drinkers.",

We investigated the largest sample reported to date (N = 213) with the primary goal of determining how specific clinical features impact neurometabolite concentrations in an anterior cingulate gray matter voxel. This community dwelling sample included both treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking individuals. A healthy control group (N = 66) was matched for age and education. In multivariate analyses predicting neurometabolite concentrations, the heavy drinking group had greater concentrations overall. An age by group interaction was noted, as group difference across neurometabolites increased with age. More years drinking, but not more drinks per drinking day (DPDD) predicted greater concentrations of choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine-phosphocreatine (Cre), glutamate-glutamine (Glx), and n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). The effects of other clinical variables (depression, cigarette smoking, marijuana use) were negligible. After controlling for DPDD and years drinking, treatment-seeking status had no impact on neurometabolites. In the very oldest portion of the sample (mean age = 50), however, a negative relationship was seen between NAA and years drinking. These results suggest that the nature of neurometabolite abnormalities in chronic heavy drinkers may vary as a function of duration of abuse.",

Generally, glycine is synthesized from choline, serine, hydroxyproline, and threonine through interorgan metabolism in which kidneys and liver are the primarily involved. Generally in common feeding conditions, glycine is not sufficiently synthesized in humans, animals, and birds. Glycine acts as precursor for several key metabolites of low molecular weight such as creatine, glutathione, haem, purines, and porphyrins. Glycine is very effective in improving the health and supports the growth and well-being of humans and animals. There are overwhelming reports supporting the role of supplementary glycine in prevention of many diseases and disorders including cancer. Dietary supplementation of proper dose of glycine is effectual in treating metabolic disorders in patients with cardiovascular diseases, several inflammatory diseases, obesity, cancers, and diabetes. Glycine also has the property to enhance the quality of sleep and neurological functions. In this review we will focus on the metabolism of glycine in humans and animals and the recent findings and advances about the beneficial effects and protection of glycine in different disease states.",

		"abstract": "Hepatocytes are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α- (TNF) induced killing/apoptosis under normal circumstances, but primary hepatocytes from rats chronically fed alcohol have increased TNF cytotoxicity. Therefore, there must be mechanism(s) by which alcohol exposure “sensitizes” to TNF hepatotoxicity. Abnormal metabolism of methionine and Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) are well documented acquired metabolic abnormalities in ALD. Sadenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is the product of SAM in hepatic transmethylation reactions, and SAH hydrolase (SAHH) is the only enzyme to metabolize SAH to homocysteine and adenosine. Our previous studies demonstrated that chronic intracellular accumulation of SAH sensitized hepatocytes to TNF cytotoxicity in vitro. In the current study, we extended our previous observations by further characterizing the effects of chronic alcohol intake on mitochondrial SAM levels in liver and examining its possible involvement in SAH sensitization to TNF hepatotoxicity. Chronic alcohol consumption in mice not only increased cytosolic SAH levels, but also decreased mitochondrial SAM concentration, leading to decreased mitochondrial SAM to SAH ratio. Moreover, accumulation of hepatic SAH induced by administration of 3-deazaadenosine (DZA-a potent inhibitor of SAHH) enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) /TNF hepatotoxicity in mice in vivo. Inhibition of SAHH by DZA resulted not only in accumulation of cytoplasmic SAH, but also in depletion of the mitochondrial SAM pool. Further studies using mitochondrial SAM transporter inhibitors showed that inhibition of SAM transport into mitochondria sensitized HepG2 cells to TNF cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that depletion of the mitochondrial SAM pool by SAH, which is elevated during chronic alcohol consumption, plays a critical role in SAH induced sensitization to TNF hepatotoxicity.",

		"abstract": "Fatty liver disease associated with chronic alcohol consumption or obesity/type 2 diabetes has emerged as a serious public health problem. Steatosis, accumulation of triglyceride in hepatocytes, is now recognized as a critical “first-hit” in the pathogenesis of liver disease. It is proposed that steatosis “primes” the liver to progress to more severe liver pathologies when individuals are exposed to subsequent metabolic and/or environmental stressors or “second-hits”. Genetic risk factors can also influence the susceptibility and severity of fatty liver disease. Furthermore, oxidative stress, disrupted nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunctional are proposed to be key molecular events that accelerate or worsen steatosis and initiate progression to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. This review article will discuss the following topics regarding the pathobiology and molecular mechanisms responsible for fatty liver disease: 1) the “two-hit” or “multi-hit” hypothesis; 2) the role of mitochondrial bioenergetic defects and oxidant stress; 3) interplay between NO and mitochondria in fatty liver disease; 4) genetic risk factors and oxidative stress responsive genes; and 5) the feasibility of antioxidants for treatment.",

		"abstract": "AIM: To examine the effects of ethanol-induced proteasome inhibition, and the effects of proteasome inhibition in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms., METHODS: Rats were fed ethanol for 1 mo using the Tsukamoto-French model and were compared to rats given the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (Bortezomib, Velcade™) by intraperitoneal injection. Microarray analysis and real time PCR were performed and proteasome activity assays and Western blot analysis were performed using isolated nuclei., RESULTS: Chronic ethanol feeding caused a significant inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the nucleus, which led to changes in the turnover of transcriptional factors, histone-modifying enzymes, and, therefore, affected epigenetic mechanisms. Chronic ethanol feeding was related to an increase in histone acetylation, and it is hypothesized that the proteasome proteolytic activity regulated histone modifications by controlling the stability of histone modifying enzymes, and, therefore, regulated the chromatin structure, allowing easy access to chromatin by RNA polymerase, and, thus, proper gene expression. Proteasome inhibition by PS-341 increased histone acetylation similar to chronic ethanol feeding. In addition, proteasome inhibition caused dramatic changes in hepatic remethylation reactions as there was a significant decrease in the enzymes responsible for the regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, and, in particular, a significant decrease in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase enzyme. This suggested that hypomethylation was associated with proteasome inhibition, as indicated by the decrease in histone methylation., CONCLUSION: The role of proteasome inhibition in regulating epigenetic mechanisms, and its link to liver injury in alcoholic liver disease, is thus a promising approach to study liver injury due to chronic ethanol consumption.",

		"abstract": "S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) minimizes alcohol hepatotoxicity; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for SAM hepatoprotection remain unknown. Herein, we use proteomics to determine whether the hepatoprotective action of SAM against early-stage alcoholic liver disease is linked to alterations in the mitochondrial proteome. For this, male rats were fed control or ethanol-containing liquid diets ± SAM and liver mitochondria were prepared for proteomic analysis. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (2D IEF/SDS-PAGE) and blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) were used to determine changes in matrix and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) proteins, respectively. SAM coadministration minimized alcohol-dependent inflammation and preserved mitochondrial respiration. SAM supplementation preserved liver SAM levels in ethanol-fed rats; however, mitochondrial SAM levels were increased by ethanol and SAM treatments. With use of 2D IEF/SDS-PAGE, 30 proteins showed significant changes in abundance in response to ethanol, SAM, or both. Classes of proteins affected by ethanol and SAM treatments were chaperones, beta oxidation proteins, sulfur metabolism proteins, and dehydrogenase enzymes involved in methionine, glycine, and choline metabolism. BN-PAGE revealed novel changes in the levels of 19 OxPhos proteins in response to ethanol, SAM, or both. Ethanol- and SAM-dependent alterations in the proteome were not linked to corresponding changes in gene expression. In conclusion, ethanol and SAM treatment led to multiple changes in the liver mitochondrial proteome. The protective effects of SAM against alcohol toxicity are mediated, in part, through maintenance of proteins involved in key mitochondrial energy conserving and biosynthetic pathways. This study demonstrates that SAM may be a promising candidate for treatment of alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "It has been well established that S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is the principal methyl donor in methyltransferase reactions and that SAMe supplementation restores hepatic glutathione (GSH) deposits and attenuates liver injury. However, the effectiveness of SAMe therapy in chronic liver disease has not been adequately addressed. We searched globally recognized electronic databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Database and EMBASE, to retrieve relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chronic liver disease published in the past 20 years. We then performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the enrolled trials that met the inclusion criteria.The results showed that twelve RCTs from 11 studies, which examined 705 patients, were included in this research. For liver function, certain results obtained from data synthesis and independent comparisons demonstrated significant differences between the levels of total bilirubin (TBIL) and aspartate transaminase (AST). However, no studies identified significant differences regarding alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. An analysis of the adverse events and long-term prognosis also indicated no significant differences between the SAMe and the placebo groups. In a subgroup analysis of gravidas and children, several of the included data indicated that there was a significant difference in the pruritus score. Furthermore, the results regarding ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and stronger neo-minophagen C (SNMC) indicated that both treatments were more effective than SAMe was in certain chronic liver diseases. These findings suggest that SAMe could be used as the basis of a medication regimen for liver function improvement because of its safety. However, SAMe also demonstrated limited clinical value in the treatment of certain chronic liver diseases.",

Thirty-two Wistar rats received the low fat (10% of total calories) Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet as follows: either ethanol alone (Alc group, 36% of total calories) or ethanol in combination with VC (Alc + VC group, 40 mg VC/100 g body weight) or VE (Alc + VE group, 0.8 mg VE/100 g body weight). Control rats were pair-fed a liquid diet with the Alc group. Ethanol administration induced a modest increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), conjugated dienes (CD), and triglycerides but decreased total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP) in plasma. VE supplementation to alcohol-fed rats restored the plasma levels of AST, CD, and TRAP to control levels. However, VC supplementation did not significantly influence plasma ALT, AST, or CD. In addition, a significant increase in plasma aminothiols such as homocysteine and cysteine was observed in the Alc group, but cysteinylglycine and glutathione (GSH) did not change by ethanol feeding. Supplementing alcohol-fed rats with VC increased plasma GSH and hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, but plasma levels of aminothiols, except GSH, were not influenced by either VC or VE supplementation in ethanol-fed rats. These results indicate that a low-fat ethanol diet induces oxidative stress and consequent liver toxicity similar to a high-fat ethanol diet and that VE supplementation has a protective effect on ethanol-induced oxidative stress and liver toxicity.",

		"abstract": "Folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia are found in most patients with alcoholic liver disease. Oxidative stress is one of the most important mechanisms contributing to homocysteine (Hcy)-induced tissue injury. However it has not been examined whether exogenous administration of folic acid attenuates oxidative stress and hepatic toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of folic acid supplementation on oxidative stress and hepatic toxicity induced by chronic ethanol consumption. Wistar rats (n = 32) were divided into four groups and fed 0%, 12%, 36% ethanol, or 36% ethanol plus folic acid (10 mg folic acid/L) diets. After 5 weeks, chronic consumption of the 36% ethanol diet significantly increased plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) (P < 0.05) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (P < 0.05), triglycerides (TG) (P < 0.05), Hcy (P < 0.001), and low density lipoprotein conjugated dienes (CD) (P < 0.05) but decreased total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP) (P < 0.001). These changes were prevented partially by folic acid supplementation. The 12% ethanol diet had no apparent effect on most parameters. Plasma Hcy concentration was well correlated with plasma ALT (r = 0.612**), AST (r = 0.652*), CD (r = 0.495*), and TRAP (r = -0.486*). The results indicate that moderately elevated Hcy is associated with increased oxidative stress and liver injury in alcohol-fed rats, and suggests that folic acid supplementation appears to attenuate hepatic toxicity induced by chronic ethanol consumption possibly by decreasing oxidative stress.",

The fifth group was assigned to sham operation. At the end of fourth week, the rats were decapitated, and hepatic tissue biochemical collagen content and collagen surface area were measured. Hepatic tissue specimens were histopathologically evaluated according to Scheuer system. Serum hyaluronate levels were measured by ELISA method., RESULTS: Despite being higher than sham group, hepatic collagen level was significantly decreased in each of the vitC, vitE and vitEC groups (32.7 ± 1.2, 33.8 ± 2.9, 36.7 ± 0.5 μg collagen/mg protein, respectively) compared to BDL (48.3 ± 0.6 mg collagen/g protein) (P < 0.001 for each vitamin group). Each isolated vitamin C, isolated vitamin E and combined vitamin E/C supplementation prevented the increase in hepatic collagen surface density (7.0% ± 1.1%, 6.2% ± 1.7%, 12.3% ± 2.0%, respectively) compared to BDL (17.4% ± 5.6%) (P < 0.05 for each). The same beneficial effect of vitamin C, vitamin E and combined vitamin E/C treatment was also observed on the decrease of serum hyaluronate levels compared to BDL group (P < 0.001). The relative liver and spleen weights, serum transaminases, cholestatic enzymes, bilirubins and histopathological inflammation scores were not different between the antioxidant treatment groups and the control. However, fibrosis staging scores were obviously reduced only in the vitamin E/C combination group (vit EC: 2.4 ± 0.8 vs BDL: 3.1 ± 0.7; P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Each antioxidant vitamin E, vitamin C and their combination retard hepatic fibrosis in biliary-obstructed rats.

Plasma aminothiols, lipids, malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase were measured. Hepatic folate, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were measured.\n\nRESULTS\nDL-Met supplementation was found to increase plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and MDA compared to rats fed ethanol alone and decrease plasma ALT. However, DL-Met supplementation did not significantly change plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and glutathione. In addition, DL-Met supplementation increased hepatic levels of folate, SAM, SAH, and SAM:SAH ratio. Our data showed that DL-Met supplementation can increase plasma oxidative stress and atherogenic effects by elevating plasma Hcy, TG, and TC in ethanol-fed rats.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe present results demonstrate that Met supplementation increases plasma oxidative stress and atherogenic effects by inducing dyslipidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia in ethanol-fed rats.",

		"abstract": "NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), associated with obesity and the cardiometabolic syndrome, is an important medical problem affecting up to 20% of western populations. Evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in NAFLD initiation and progression to the more serious condition of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Herein we hypothesize that mitochondrial defects induced by exposure to a HFD (high fat diet) contribute to a hypoxic state in liver and this is associated with increased protein modification by RNS (reactive nitrogen species). To test this concept, C57BL/6 mice were pair-fed a control diet and HFD containing 35% and 71% total calories (1 cal≈4.184 J) from fat respectively, for 8 or 16 weeks and liver hypoxia, mitochondrial bioenergetics, NO (nitric oxide)-dependent control of respiration, and 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine), a marker of protein modification by RNS, were examined. Feeding a HFD for 16 weeks induced NASH-like pathology accompanied by elevated triacylglycerols, increased CYP2E1 (cytochrome P450 2E1) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) protein, and significantly enhanced hypoxia in the pericentral region of the liver. Mitochondria from the HFD group showed increased sensitivity to NO-dependent inhibition of respiration compared with controls. In addition, accumulation of 3-NT paralleled the hypoxia gradient in vivo and 3-NT levels were increased in mitochondrial proteins. Liver mitochondria from mice fed the HFD for 16 weeks exhibited depressed state 3 respiration, uncoupled respiration, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to a HFD negatively affects the bioenergetics of liver mitochondria and this probably contributes to hypoxic stress and deleterious NO-dependent modification of mitochondrial proteins.",

		"abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the autophagic response of Sertoli cells (SCs) to acute ethanol toxicity using in vivo and in vitro models. Adult Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with either 5 g/kg ethanol or phosphate-buffered saline (for the control group) and sacrificed 0, 3, 6 and 24 h after injection. Compared to the control group, enhanced germ cell apoptosis was observed in the ethanol-treated rats (ETRs) in association with upregulation of iNOS and reduced expression of androgen receptor protein levels in SCs, which were resistant to apoptosis. Meanwhile, autophagy was upregulated in ETR SCs (peaking at 24 h) compared to the control group, as evidenced by transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation, enhanced expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3-II (LC3-II), lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), pan cathepsin protein levels and reduced expression of p62. This upregulation of SC autophagy was confirmed ultrastructurally by enhanced formation of autophagic vacuoles and by immunofluorescent double labelling of autophagosomal and lysosomal markers. Study of cultured SCs confirmed enhanced autophagic response to ethanol toxicity, which was cytoprotective based on decreased viability of SCs upon blocking autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The results highlighted the molecular mechanisms of prosurvival autophagy in ETR SCs for the first time, and may have significant implications for male fertility.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic fatty liver diseases (AFLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) are two pathological conditions that are spreading worldwide. Both conditions are remarkably similar with regards to the pathophysiological mechanism and progression despite different causes. Oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction through post-translational protein modifications and/or mitochondrial DNA damage has been a major risk factor in both AFLD and NAFLD development and progression. Cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1), a known important inducer of oxidative radicals in the cells, has been reported to remarkably increase in both AFLD and NAFLD. Interestingly, CYP2E1 isoforms expressed in both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, likely lead to the deleterious consequences in response to alcohol or in conditions of NAFLD after exposure to high fat diet (HFD) and in obesity and diabetes. Whether CYP2E1 in both ER and mitochondria work simultaneously or sequentially in various conditions and whether mitochondrial CYP2E1 may exert more pronounced effects on mitochondrial dysfunction in AFLD and NAFLD are unclear. The aims of this review are to briefly describe the role of CYP2E1 and resultant oxidative stress in promoting mitochondrial dysfunction and the development or progression of AFLD and NAFLD, to shed a light on the function of the mitochondrial CYP2E1 as compared with the ER-associated CYP2E1. We finally discuss translational research opportunities related to this field.",

The present study tested the hypothesis that reductive stress mediates the effects of ethanol on liver methionine metabolism. Isolated rat livers were perfused with ethanol or propanol to induce a reductive stress by increasing the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and the concentrations of SAM and SAH in the liver tissue were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio induced by ethanol or propanol was associated with a marked decrease in SAM and an increase in SAH liver content. 4-Methylpyrazole, an inhibitor the NAD+-dependent enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, blocked the increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio and prevented the alterations in SAM and SAH. Similarly, co-infusion of pyruvate, which is metabolized by the NADH-dependent enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, restored the NADH/NAD+ ratio and normalized SAM and SAH levels. The data establish an initial link between the effects of ethanol on the NADH/NAD+ redox couple and the effects of ethanol on methionine metabolism in the liver.",

		"abstract": "Background\nChronic alcohol exposure results in liver injury that is driven in partby inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). Hepatocytes are normally resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF, but they become sensitized to TNF by chronic alcohol exposure. Recently we reported that the decrease in the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) that occurs with alcoholic liver injury renders hepatocytes sensitive to TNF cytotoxicity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether inhibition of the transcription factor NFκB contributed to TNF-induced cell death in hepatocytes with high levels of SAH.\n\nMethods\nPrimary human hepatocytes or HepG2 cells were pre-incubated with a combination of adenosine plus homocysteine to increase SAH levels. Following exposure toTNF, viability was determined by the MTT assay, and activation of the NFκB pathway was assessed by measuring degradation of cytosolic IκB-α, phosphorylation and translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, and expression of NFκB-dependent genes.TNF-induced apoptotic signaling pathways were assessed by monitoring levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, A20, and cleavage products of the caspase-8 substrate, RIP1.\n\nResults\nNFκB-mediated gene expression was inhibited in cells with high SAH, despite the fact that TNF-induced degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkB-α and accumulation of NF-κB in the nucleus persisted for much longer. In contrast to control cells, the NF-κB that accumulated in the nucleus of cells with high SAH levels was not phosphorylated at serine 536, a modification associated with activation of the transactivation potential of this transcription factor. The inhibition of transactivation by NF-κB resulted in lower mRNA and protein levels of the anti-apoptotic protein A20 and increased cleavage of RIP1.\n\nConclusions\nHigh SAH levels inhibitedNFκB-mediatedgene expression and sensitized primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells to the cytotoxic effects of TNF. It is likely that cross-talk with other transcription factors is perturbed under these conditions, resulting in still other changes in gene expression.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol consumption is the principal factor in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is defined by histological lesions on the liver that can range from simple hepatic steatosis to more advanced stages such as alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. As one of the oldest forms of liver injury known to humans, ALD is still a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality and the burden is exerting on medical systems with hospitalization and management costs rising constantly worldwide. Although the biological mechanisms, including increasing of acetaldehyde, oxidative stress with induction of cytochrome p450 2E1, inflammatory cytokine release, abnormal lipid metabolism and induction of hepatocyte apoptosis, by which chronic alcohol consumption triggers serious complex progression of ALD is well established, there is no universally accepted therapy to prevent or reverse. In this article, we have briefly reviewed the pathogenesis of ALD and the molecular targets for development of novel therapies. This review is focused on current therapeutic strategies for ALD, including lifestyle modification with nutrition supplements, available pharmacological drugs and new agents that are under development, liver transplantation, application of complementary medicines, and their combination. The relevant molecular mechanisms of each conventional medication and natural agent have been reviewed according to current available knowledge in the literature. We also summarized efficacy vs safety on conventional and herbal medicines which are specifically used for the prevention and treatment of ALD. Through a system review, this article highlighted that the combination of pharmaceutical drugs with naturally occurring agents may offer an optimal management for ALD and its complications. It is worthwhile to conduct large-scale, multiple centre clinical trials to further prove the safety and benefits for the integrative therapy on ALD.",

		"abstract": "Long-term excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD)—a global health problem without effective therapeutic approach. ALD is increasingly considered as a complex and multifaceted pathological process, involving oxidative stress, inflammation and excessive fatty acid synthesis. Over the past decade, herbal medicines have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of ALD, due to their multiple targets and less toxic side effects. Several herbs, such as Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson (Apiaceae), Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae) and Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi (Leguminosae), etc., have been shown to be quite effective and are being widely used in China today for the treatment of ALD when used alone or in combination. To review current available knowledge on herbal medicines used to prevent or treat ALD and their underlying mechanisms. We used the pre-set searching syntax and inclusion criteria to retrieve available published literature from PUBMED and Web of Science databases, all herbal medicines and their active compounds tested on ALD induced by both acute and chronic alcohol ingestion were included. A total of 40 experimental studies involving 34 herbal medicines and (or) active compounds were retrieved and reviewed. We found that all reported extracts and individual compounds from herbal medicines/natural plants could be beneficial to ALD, which might be attributed to regulate multiple critical targets involved in the pathways of oxidation, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Screening chemical candidate from herbal medicine might be a promising approach to drug discovery for the prevention or treatment of ALD. However, further studies remain to be done on the systematic assessment of herbal medicines against ALD and the underlying mechanisms, as well as their quality control studies.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholism results in about 2.5 million deaths annually worldwide, representing 4% of all mortality. Although alcoholism is associated with more than 60 diseases, most mortality from alcoholism results from alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD includes alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis, in order of increasing severity. Important scoring systems of ALD severity include: Child-Pugh, a semi-quantitative scoring system useful to roughly characterize clinical severity; model for end-stage liver disease, a quantitative, objective scoring system used for prognostication and prioritization for liver transplantation; and discriminant function, used to determine whether to administer corticosteroids for alcoholic hepatitis. Abstinence is the cornerstone of ALD therapy. Psychotherapies, including twelve-step facilitation therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy, help support abstinence. Disulfiram decreases alcohol consumption by causing unpleasant sensations after drinking alcohol from accumulation of acetaldehyde in serum, but disulfiram can be hepatotoxic. Adjunctive pharmacotherapies to reduce alcohol consumption include naltrexone, acamprosate, and baclofen. Nutritional therapy helps reverse muscle wasting, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and trace element deficiencies associated with ALD. Although reduced protein intake was previously recommended for advanced ALD to prevent hepatic encephalopathy, a diet containing 1.2-1.5 g of protein/kg per day is currently recommended to prevent muscle wasting. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for severe alcoholic hepatitis (discriminant function ≥ 32), but proof of their efficacy in decreasing mortality remains elusive. Pentoxifylline is an alternative therapy. Complications of advanced ALD include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, esophageal variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and portopulmonary hypertension. Alcoholic cirrhotics have increased risk of developing hepatomas. Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapy for severe ALD, but generally requires 6 mo of proven abstinence for eligibility. Alcoholic cirrhotics who maintain abstinence generally have a relatively favorable prognosis after liver transplantation.",

		"abstract": "This report is a summary of a symposium on the role of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), betaine, and folate in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which was organized by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in collaboration with the Office of Dietary Supplements and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and held on 3 October 2005. SAM supplementation may attenuate ALD by decreasing oxidative stress through the up-regulation of glutathione synthesis, reducing inflammation via the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α and the up-regulation of interleukin-10 synthesis, increasing the ratio of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and inhibiting the apoptosis of normal hepatocytes and stimulating the apoptosis of liver cancer cells. Folate deficiency may accelerate or promote ALD by increasing hepatic homocysteine and SAH concentrations; decreasing hepatic SAM and glutathione concentrations and the SAM-SAH ratio; increasing cytochrome P4502E1 activation and lipid peroxidation; up-regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, including sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1, and proapoptotic gene caspase-12; and decreasing global DNA methylation. Betaine may attenuate ALD by increasing the synthesis of SAM and, eventually, glutathione, decreasing the hepatic concentrations of homocysteine and SAH, and increasing the SAM-SAH ratio, which can trigger a cascade of events that lead to the activation of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and formation of VLDL for the export of triacylglycerol from the liver to the circulation. Additionally, decreased concentrations of homocysteine can down-regulate endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to the attenuation of apoptosis and fatty acid synthesis.",

		"abstract": "Convincing evidence links aberrant B-vitamin dependent hepatic methionine metabolism to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This review focuses on the essential roles of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 in hepatic methionine metabolism, the causes of their deficiencies among chronic alcoholic persons, and how their deficiencies together with chronic alcohol exposure impact on aberrant methionine metabolism in the pathogenesis of ALD. Folate is the dietary transmethylation donor for the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the substrate for all methyltransferases that regulate gene expressions in pathways of liver injury, as well as a regulator of the transsulfuration pathway that is essential for production of glutathione (GSH), the principal antioxidant for defense against oxidative liver injury. Vitamin B12 regulates transmethylation reactions for SAM production and vitamin B6 regulates transsulfuration reactions for GSH production. Folate deficiency accelerates the experimental development of ALD in ethanol-fed animals while reducing liver SAM levels with resultant abnormal gene expression and decreased production of antioxidant GSH. Through its effects on folate metabolism, reduced SAM also impairs nucleotide balance with resultant increased DNA strand breaks, oxidation, hepatocellular apoptosis, and risk of carcinogenesis. The review encompasses referenced studies on mechanisms for perturbations of methionine metabolism in ALD, evidence for altered gene expressions and their epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of ALD, and clinical studies on potential prevention and treatment of ALD by correction of methionine metabolism with SAM.",

		"abstract": "Since creatinine excretion reflects a continuous loss of creatine and creatine phosphate, there is a need for creatine replacement, from the diet and/or by de novo synthesis. Creatine synthesis requires three amino acids, methionine, glycine, and arginine, and two enzymes, l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), which produces guanidinoacetate acid (GAA), and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), which methylates GAA to produce creatine. In the rat, high activities of AGAT are found in the kidney, whereas high activities of GAMT occur in the liver. Rat hepatocytes readily convert GAA to creatine; this synthesis is stimulated by the addition of methionine, which increases cellular S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. These same hepatocytes are unable to produce creatine from methionine, arginine, and glycine. 15N from 15NH4Cl is readily incorporated into urea but not into creatine. Hepatic uptake of GAA is evident in vivo by livers of rats fed a creatine-free diet but not when rats were fed a creatine-supplemented diet. Rats fed the creatine-supplemented diet had greatly decreased renal AGAT activity and greatly decreased plasma [GAA] but no decrease in hepatic GAMT or in the capacity of hepatocytes to produce creatine from GAA. These studies indicate that hepatocytes are incapable of the entire synthesis of creatine but are capable of producing it from GAA. They also illustrate the interplay between the dietary provision of creatine and its de novo synthesis and point to the crucial role of renal AGAT expression in regulating creatine synthesis in the rat.",

Whole body turnover of glycine and its appearance in creatine was quantified using [1-13C] glycine and the rate of protein turnover was quantified using L-ring [2H5] phenylalanine. The creatine pool size was estimated by the dilution of a bolus [C2H3] creatine. Studies were repeated following a five days supplement creatine 21g.day−1 and following supplement amino acids 14.3 g.day−1. Creatine caused a ten folds increase in the plasma concentration of creatine and a 50% decrease in the concentration of guanidinoacetic acid. Plasma amino acids profile showed a significant decrease in glycine, glutamine and taurine and a significant increase in citrulline, valine, lysine and cysteine. There was a significant decrease in the rate of appearance of glycine, suggesting a decrease in de-novo synthesis (p=0.006). The fractional and absolute rate of synthesis of creatine was significantly decreased by supplemental creatine. Amino acid supplement had no impact on any of the parameters. Creatine supplement caused a significant decrease in the rate of synthesis of creatine. This is the first detailed analysis of creatine kinetics and the effects of creatine supplement in healthy young men and women. These methods can be applied for the analysis of creatine kinetics in different physiological states.",

		"abstract": "Hepatic enzymes can be used as a predictor of hepatic injury. The present study investigated the relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and hepatic enzymes in patients intoxicated with ethanol at an emergency department (ED). To determine whether BAC is an independent predictor of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, we retrospectively reviewed the medical data for patients who were intoxicated and whose BAC and hepatic enzyme levels were measured. Patients who had hepatitis caused by viruses or traumatic hepatic injury, as well as patients with a normal BAC, were excluded. Of the 1432 patients, 298 were female and 1134 were male. The average age of males was 41.4 ± 11.7 years and that of females was 35.6 ± 11.8 years. Mean serum AST and ALT levels were 78 ± 88 IU/L and 51 ± 67 IU/L in males, while those in females were 63 ± 110 IU/L and 40 ± 83 IU/L, respectively. Mean BACs were 199.6 ± 99.0 mg/dL for males and 175.1 ± 101.1 mg/dL for females. Log BAC had a high positive correlation with log ALT (r = 0.208; p < 0.001) and log AST (r = 0.086; p = 0.001) when BAC was above 50 mg/dL (0.05%). Multivariate linear regression showed that BAC was an independent predictor of AST and ALT (r2 = 0.057 and 0.056, respectively). The high correlation of BAC with serum AST and ALT levels in patients intoxicated with ethanol when their BAC was above 50 mg/dL can be used to predict serum AST and ALT levels. However, a high BAC only appears to be associated with a slight elevation in hepatic enzymes. Therefore, in patients with acute alcohol intoxication at the ED, an elevation in AST and ALT levels should be considered as a result of hepatic injury rather than an effect of alcohol.",

		"abstract": "The concept of moderate consumption of ethanol (beverage alcohol) has evolved over time from considering this level of intake to be nonintoxicating and noninjurious, to encompassing levels defined as “statistically” normal in particular populations, and the public health-driven concepts that define moderate drinking as the level corresponding to the lowest overall rate of morbidity or mortality in a population. The various approaches to defining moderate consumption of ethanol provide for a range of intakes that can result in blood ethanol concentrations ranging from 5 to 6 mg/dl, to levels of over 90 mg/dl (i.e., 20 mM). This review summarizes available information regarding the effects of moderate consumption of ethanol on the adult and the developing nervous systems. The metabolism of ethanol in the human is reviewed to allow for proper appreciation of the important variables that interact to influence the level of exposure of the brain to ethanol once ethanol is orally consumed. At the neurochemical level, the moderate consumption of ethanol selectively affects the function of GABA, glutamatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and opioid neuronal systems. Ethanol can affect these systems directly, and/or the interactions between and among these systems become important in the expression of ethanol's actions. The behavioral consequences of ethanol's actions on brain neurochemistry, and the neurochemical effects themselves, are very much dose- and time-related, and the collage of ethanol's actions can change significantly even on the rising and falling phases of the blood ethanol curve. The behavioral effects of moderate ethanol intake can encompass events that the human or other animal can perceive as reinforcing through either positive (e.g., pleasurable, activating) or negative (e.g., anxiolysis, stress reduction) reinforcement mechanisms. Genetic factors and gender play an important role in the metabolism and behavioral actions of ethanol, and doses of ethanol producing pleasurable feelings, activation, and reduction of anxiety in some humans/animals can have aversive, sedative, or no effect in others. Research on the cognitive effects of acute and chronic moderate intake of ethanol is reviewed, and although a number of studies have noted a measurable diminution in neuropsychologic parameters in habitual consumers of moderate amounts of ethanol, others have not found such changes. Recent studies have also noted some positive effects of moderate ethanol consumption on cognitive performance in the aging human. The moderate consumption of ethanol by pregnant women can have significant consequences on the developing nervous system of the fetus. Consumption of ethanol during pregnancy at levels considered to be in the moderate range can generate fetal alcohol effects (behavioral, cognitive anomalies) in the offspring. A number of factors–including gestational period, the periodicity of the mother's drinking, genetic factors, etc.–play important roles in determining the effect of ethanol on the developing central nervous system. A series of recommendations for future research endeavors, at all levels, is included with this review as part of the assessment of the effects of moderate ethanol consumption on the central nervous system",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcoholics who also binge drink (i.e., acute on chronic) are prone to an exacerbated liver injury but its mechanism is not understood. We therefore investigated the in vivo effects of chronic and binge ethanol ingestion and compared to chronic ethanol followed by three repeat binge ethanol on the liver of male C57/BL6 mice fed ethanol in liquid diet (4%) for four weeks followed by binge ethanol (intragastric administration, 3.5 g/kg body weight, three doses, 12h apart). Chronic followed by binge ethanol exacerbated fat accumulation, necrosis, decrease in hepatic SAM and SAM:SAH ratio, increase in adenosine levels, and elevated CYP2E1 levels. Histone H3 lysine acetylation (H3AcK9), dually modified phosphoacetylated histone H3 (H3AcK9/PS10), and phosphorylated H2AX increased after binge whereas phosphorylation of histone H3 ser 10 (H3S10) and H3 ser 28 (H3S28) increased after chronic ethanol-binge. Histone H3 lysine 4 and 9 dimethylation increased with a marked dimethylation in H3K9 in chronic ethanol binge group. Trimethylated histone H3 levels did not change. Nuclear levels of histone acetyl transferase GCN5 and histone deacetylase HDAC3 were elevated whereas phospho-CREB decreased in a distinctive manner. Taken together, acute on chronic ethanol ingestion caused amplification of liver injury and elicited characteristic profiles of histone modifications, metabolic alterations, and changes in nuclear protein levels. These findings demonstrate that chronic ethanol exposure renders liver more susceptible to repeat acute/binge ethanol induced acceleration of alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol is a simple and consumable biomolecule yet its excessive consumption disturbs numerous biological pathways damaging nearly all organs of the human body. One of the essential biological processes affected by the harmful effects of alcohol is proteostasis, which regulates the balance between biogenesis and turnover of proteins within and outside the cell. A significant amount of published evidence indicates that alcohol and its metabolites directly or indirectly interfere with protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, which triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to either restoration of homeostasis or cell death, inflammation and other pathologies under severe and chronic alcohol conditions. The UPR senses the abnormal protein accumulation and activates transcription factors that regulate nuclear transcription of genes related to ER function. Similarly, this kind of protein stress response can occur in other cellular organelles, which is an evolving field of interest. Here, I review recent advances in the alcohol-induced ER stress response as well as discuss new concepts on alcohol-induced mitochondrial, Golgi and lysosomal stress responses and injuries.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol metabolism takes place primarily in the liver. Initial exposures to ethanol have a major impact on the hepatic redox state and intermediary metabolism as a consequence of ethanol metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase. However, upon continued exposure to ethanol, the progression of liver injury involves ethanol metabolism via CYP2E1 and consequent oxidant stress, as well as potential direct effects of ethanol on membrane proteins that are independent of ethanol metabolism. Multiple organ systems contribute to liver injury, including the innate immune system and adipose tissue. In response to ethanol exposure, specific signal transduction pathways, including NFκB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, are activated. These complex responses to ethanol exposure translate into activation of nuclear transcription factors and altered gene expression within the liver, leading to the development of steatosis and inflammation in the early stages of alcohol-induced liver injury.",

The consequences of alcohol metabolism include oxygen deficits (i.e., hypoxia) in the liver; interaction between alcohol metabolism byproducts and other cell components, resulting in the formation of harmful compounds (i.e., adducts); formation of highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules (i.e., reactive oxygen species [ROS]) that can damage other cell components; changes in the ratio of NADH to NAD+ (i.e., the cell's redox state); tissue damage; fetal damage; impairment of other metabolic processes; cancer; and medication interactions.

		"abstract": "Unmanaged sudden withdrawal from the excessive consumption of alcohol (ethanol) adversely alters neuronal integrity in vulnerable brain regions such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, or cortex. In addition to well known hyperexcitatory neurotransmissions, ethanol withdrawal (EW) provokes the intense generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of stress-responding protein kinases, which are the focus of this review article. EW also inflicts mitochondrial membranes/membrane potential, perturbs redox balance, and suppresses mitochondrial enzymes, all of which impair a fundamental function of mitochondria. Moreover, EW acts as an age-provoking stressor. The vulnerable age to EW stress is not necessarily the oldest age and varies depending upon the target molecule of EW. A major female sex steroid, 17β-estradiol (E2), interferes with the EW-induced alteration of oxidative signaling pathways and thereby protects neurons, mitochondria, and behaviors. The current review attempts to provide integrated information at the levels of oxidative signaling mechanisms by which EW provokes brain injuries and E2 protects against it.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acute ethanol hangover on motor performance in association with the brain cortex energetic metabolism. Evaluation of motor performance and brain cortex mitochondrial function during alcohol hangover was performed in mice 6 hours after a high ethanol dose (hangover onset). Animals were injected i.p. either with saline (control group) or with ethanol (3.8 g/kg BW) (hangover group). Ethanol hangover group showed a bad motor performance compared with control animals (p < .05). Oxygen uptake in brain cortex mitochondria from hangover animals showed a 34% decrease in the respiratory control rate as compared with the control group. Mitochondrial complex activities were decreased being the complex I–III the less affected by the hangover condition; complex II–III was markedly decreased by ethanol hangover showing 50% less activity than controls. Complex IV was 42% decreased as compared with control animals. Hydrogen peroxide production was 51% increased in brain cortex mitochondria from the hangover group, as compared with the control animals. Quantification of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential indicated that ethanol injected animals presented 17% less ability to maintain the polarized condition as compared with controls. These results indicate that a clear decrease in proton motive force occurs in brain cortex mitochondria during hangover conditions. We can conclude that a decreased motor performance observed in the hangover group of animals could be associated with brain cortex mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting impairment of its energetic metabolism.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholism is a chronic disorder characterized by the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome following the abrupt cessation of alcohol intake that includes symptoms of physical and emotional disturbances, anxiety being the most prevalent symptom. In humans, it was shown that anxiety may increase the probability of relapse. In laboratory animals, however, the use of anxiety to predict alcohol preference has remained difficult. Excitatory amino acids as glutamate have been implicated in alcohol hangover and may be responsible for the seizures and anxiety observed during withdrawal. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) is a midbrain region critical for the modulation/expression of anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and the propagation of seizures induced by alcohol withdrawal, the glutamate neurotransmission being one of the most affected. The present study was designed to evaluate whether low- (LA) and high-anxiety rats (HA), tested during the alcohol hangover phase, in which anxiety is the most prevalent symptom, are more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of alcohol when tested in a voluntary alcohol drinking procedure. Additionally, we were interested in investigating the main effects of reducing the excitatory tonus of the dorsal midbrain, after the blockade of the ionotropic glutamate receptors into the DPAG, on the voluntary alcohol intake of HA and LA motivated rats that were made previously experienced with the free operant response of alcohol drinking. For this purpose, we used local infusions of the N-metil D-Aspartato (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-kainate receptors antagonist DL-2-Amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid – DL-AP7 (10nmol/0.2μl) and l-glutamic acid diethyl ester – GDEE (160nmol/0.2μl), respectively. Alcohol intoxication was produced by 10 daily bolus intraperitonial (IP) injections of alcohol (2.0g/kg). Peak-blood alcohol levels were determined by gas-chromatography analysis in order to assess blood-alcohol content. Unconditioned and conditioned anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the use of the fear-potentiated startle procedure (FPS). Data collected showed that anxiety and alcohol drinking in HA animals are positively correlated in animals that were made previously familiarized with the anxiolytic effects of alcohol. In addition, anxiety-like behavior induced during alcohol hangover seems to be an effect of changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission into DPAG possibly involving AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors, among others.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol-induced oxidative stress seems to play a major role in mechanisms by which ethanol causes liver injury. Many pathways have been suggested to contribute to the ability of ethanol to induce a state of oxidative stress. One central pathway seems to be the induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) by ethanol. CYP2E1 metabolizes and activates many toxicological substrates, including ethanol, to more reactive, toxic products. Levels of CYP2E1 are elevated under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions and after acute and chronic alcohol treatment. CYP2E1 is also an effective generator of reactive oxygen species such as the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide and, in the presence of iron catalysts, produces powerful oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical. This review article summarizes some of the biochemical and toxicological properties of CYP2E1 and briefly describes the use of cell lines developed to constitutively express CYP2E1 and CYP2E1 knockout mice in assessing the actions of CYP2E1. Possible therapeutic implications for treatment of alcoholic liver injury by inhibition of CYP2E1 or CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress will be discussed, followed by some future directions which may help us to understand the actions of CYP2E1 and its role in alcoholic liver injury.",

Ethanol metabolism is directly involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). These form an environment favourable to oxidative stress. Ethanol treatment results in the depletion of GSH levels and decreases antioxidant activity. It elevates malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyethyl radical (HER), and hydroxynonenal (HNE) protein adducts. These cause the modification of all biological structures and consequently result in serious malfunction of cells and tissues.",

		"abstract": "Mitochondria are intimately involved in the generation of and defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are themselves targets of oxidative stress and also contribute to mechanisms by which oxidative stress–related signals control cell fate. Ethanol promotes oxidative stress, both by increasing ROS formation and by decreasing cellular defense mechanisms. These effects of ethanol are prominent in the liver, the major site of ethanol metabolism in the body. The question remains to what extent this contributes to ethanol-dependent tissue damage or the susceptibility of cells to other stressors. In this review, we consider how mitochondrial actions of ethanol influence oxidative stress management of liver cells. Mitochondrial electron transport constitutes the major intracellular source of ROS, and ethanol treatment imposes conditions that promote ROS formation by mitochondria, the effects of which may be enhanced by a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress defenses. A significant target of ethanol-related increases in oxidative stress is mitochondrial DNA. Ethanol-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, if not adequately repaired, impairs mitochondrial function, which further increases oxidative stress in the cell, leading to a vicious cycle of accumulating cell damage that is more apparent with advancing age. Uncontrolled mitochondrial formation of ROS promotes the inappropriate activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, increasing the sensitivity of cells to other pro-apoptotic or damage signals. In combination with ethanol-induced defects in mitochondrial function, these alterations may promote both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in response to otherwise benign or beneficial challenges and contribute to the onset or progression of alcohol-induced liver diseases.

Studies in animals clearly demonstrate that cytokines mediate illness-associated behavioral changes. However, the mechanisms underlying the respective psychological alterations in humans have not been established yet. Therefore, we investigated the effects of low-dose endotoxemia, a well-established and safe model of host-defense activation, on emotional, cognitive, immunological, and endocrine parameters.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In a double-blind, crossover study, 20 healthy male volunteers completed psychological questionnaires and neuropsychological tests 1, 3, and 9 hours after intravenous injection of<i>Salmonella abortus equi</i>endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg) or saline in 2 experimental sessions. Blood samples were collected hourly, and rectal temperature and heart rate were monitored continuously.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Endotoxin had no effects on physical sickness symptoms, blood pressure, or heart rate. Endotoxin caused a mild increase in rectal temperature (0.5°C), and increased the circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), soluble TNF receptors, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and cortisol. After endotoxin administration, the subjects showed a transient significant increase in the levels of anxiety (effect size [ES] = 0.55) and depressed mood (ES = 0.66). Verbal and nonverbal memory functions were significantly decreased (ES = 0.55 to 0.64). Significant positive correlations were found between cytokine secretion and endotoxin-induced anxiety (<i>r</i>= 0.49 to<i>r</i>= 0.60), depressed mood (<i>r</i>= 0.40 to<i>r</i>= 0.75), and decreases in memory performance (<i>r</i>= 0.46 to<i>r</i>= 0.68).</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>In humans, a mild stimulation of the primary host defense has negative effects on emotional and memory functions, which are probably caused by cytokine release. Hence, cytokines represent a novel target for neuropsychopharmacological research.</p>",

		"abstract": "Both clinical findings and results of experiments with animal models of alcoholic hepatitis have shown the importance of cytokine-mediated cell–cell interactions in the onset of ethanol-induced liver damage. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6, are released from Kupffer cells or infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages and elicit defensive responses in parenchymal cells, including activation of apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), generated in response to cytokine-induced stress signals in parenchymal cells and also by activation of Kupffer cells and inflammatory cells, further mobilize cellular defense mechanisms. When these defensive responses are overwhelmed cells may die by necrosis, further stimulating inflammatory responses and infiltration of neutrophils. Chronic ethanol intake (i.e., many years of heavy alcohol use in human patients, several weeks or months in experimental animals) enhances the damaging consequences of these events through a variety of mechanisms. The formation of cytokines in the liver is stimulated by increasing circulating levels of endotoxin and by enhancing the responsiveness of Kupffer cells to such stimuli. In addition, ethanol promotes oxidative stress, both by increased formation of ROS and by depletion of oxidative defenses in the cell. Furthermore, liver cells from ethanol-treated animals are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α and other cytokines than cells from control animals. Mitochondria play a critical role in the apoptotic response, and alterations in mitochondrial function after chronic ethanol treatment may contribute to enhanced cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. How the shift in the balance of cytokine-induced defensive and damage responses in hepatocytes contributes to the liver injury that occurs in alcoholic hepatitis remains poorly characterized and should be a rewarding area for future studies.",

		"abstract": "R-α-Lipoic acid is found naturally occurring as a prosthetic group in α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes of the mitochondria, and as such plays a fundamental role in metabolism. Although this has been known for decades, only recently has free supplemented α-lipoic acid been found to affect cellular metabolic processes in vitro, as it has the ability to alter the redox status of cells and interact with thiols and other antioxidants. Therefore, it appears that this compound has important therapeutic potential in conditions where oxidative stress is involved. Early case studies with α-lipoic acid were performed with little knowledge of the action of α-lipoic acid at a cellular level, but with the rationale that because the naturally occurring protein bound form of α-lipoic acid has a pivotal role in metabolism, that supplementation may have some beneficial effect. Such studies sought to evaluate the effect of supplemented α-lipoic acid, using low doses, on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism, but little or no effect was observed. A common response in these trials was an increase in glucose uptake, but increased plasma levels of pyruvate and lactate were also observed, suggesting that an inhibitory effect on the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was occurring. During the same period, α-lipoic acid was also used as a therapeutic agent in a number of conditions relating to liver disease, including alcohol-induced damage, mushroom poisoning, metal intoxification, and CCl4 poisoning. α-Lipoic acid supplementation was successful in the treatment for these conditions in many cases. Experimental studies and clinical trials in the last 5 years using high doses of α-lipoic acid (600 mg in humans) have provided new and consistent evidence for the therapeutic role of antioxidant α-lipoic acid in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetic polyneuropathy. This new insight should encourage clinicians to use α-lipoic acid in diseases affecting liver in which oxidative stress is involved.",

		"abstract": "α-Lipoic acid, which becomes a powerful antioxidant in its reduced form, has been suggested as a dietary supplement to treat diseases associated with excessive oxidant stress. Because the vascular endothelium is dysfunctional in many of these conditions, we studied the uptake, reduction, and antioxidant effects of α-lipoic acid in cultured human endothelial cells (EA.hy926). Using a new assay for dihydrolipoic acid, we found that EA.hy926 cells rapidly take up and reduce α-lipoic acid to dihydrolipoic acid, most of which is released into the incubation medium. Nonetheless, the cells maintain dihydrolipoic acid following overnight culture, probably by recycling it from α-lipoic acid. Acute reduction of α-lipoic acid activates the pentose phosphate cycle and consumes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Lysates of EA.hy926 cells reduce α-lipoic acid using both NADPH and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as electron donors, although NADPH-dependent reduction is about twice that due to NADH. NADPH-dependent α-lipoic acid reduction is mostly due to thioredoxin reductase. Pre-incubation of cells with α-lipoic acid increases their capacity to reduce extracellular ferricyanide, to recycle intracellular dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate, to decrease reactive oxygen species generated by redox cycling of menadione, and to generate nitric oxide. These results show that α-lipoic acid enhances both the antioxidant defenses and the function of endothelial cells.",

		"abstract": "Thioctic (α-lipoic) acid (TA) is a drug used for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy in Germany. It has been proposed that TA acts as an antioxidant and interferes with the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy. We suggest that one component of its antioxidant activity requiring study is the direct transition metal-chelating activity of the drug. We found that TA had a profound dose-dependent inhibitory effect upon Cu2+-catalysed ascorbic acid oxidation (monitored by O2 uptake and spectrophotometrically at 265 nm) and also increased the partition of Cu2+ into n-octanol from an aqueous solution suggesting that TA forms a lipophilic complex with Cu2+. TA also inhibited Cu2+-catalysed liposomal peroxidation. Furthermore, TA inhibited intracellular H2O2 production in erythrocytes challenged with ascorbate, a process thought to be mediated by loosely chelated Cu2+ within the erythrocyte. These data, taken together, suggest that prior intracellular reduction of TA to dihydrolipoic acid is not an obligatory mechanism for an antioxidant effect of the drug, which may also operate via Cu2+-chelation. The R-enantiomer and racemic mixture of the drug (α-TA) generally seemed more effective than the S-enantiomer in these assays of metal chelation.",

		"abstract": "Thioctic acid (TA) and its reduced form dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) have recently gained some recognition as useful biological antioxidants. In particular, the ability of DHLA to inhibit lipid peroxidation has been reported. In the present study, the effects of TA and DHLA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the aqueous phase have been investigated. Xanthine plus xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide radicals (O2-), detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using DMPO as a spin trap, were eliminated by DHLA but not by TA. The sulfhydryl content of DHLA, measured using Ellman's reagent decreased subsequent to the incubation with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase confirming the interaction between DHLA and O2-. An increase of hydrogen peroxide concentration accompanied the reaction between DHLA and O2-, suggesting the reduction of O2- by DHLA. Competition of O2- with epinephrine allowed us to estimate a second order kinetic constant of the reaction between O2- and DHLA, which was found to be a 3.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. On the other hand, the DMPO signal of hydroxyl radicals (HO.) generated by Fenton's reagent were eliminated by both TA and DHLA. Inhibition of the Fenton reaction by TA was confirmed by a chemiluminescence measurement using luminol as a probe for HO.. There was no electron transfer from Fe2+ to TA or from DHLA to Fe3+ detected by measuring the Fe(2+)-phenanthroline complex. DHLA did not potentiate the DMPO signal of HO. indicating no prooxidant activity of DHLA. These results suggest that both TA and DHLA possess antioxidant properties. In particular, DHLA is very effective as shown by its dual capability by eliminating both O2- and HO..",

		"abstract": "Agmatine is a neuromodulator that regulates multiple neurotransmitters and signaling pathways. Several studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of this molecule, which seems to be mediated by a reduction in oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and proapoptotic signaling. Since these events are implicated in acute and chronic excitotoxicity-related disorders (ischemia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) as well as in nociception, agmatine has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Agmatine also stimulates the expression of trophic factors and adult neurogenesis, contributing to its ability to induce endogenous repair mechanisms. Therefore, considering its wide range of biological effects, this review summarizes the current knowledge about its protective and regenerative properties in the CNS.",

		"abstract": "Background\n\nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the cosubstrate used by the enzyme catalase to form Compound I (the catalase-H2O2 system), which is the major pathway for the conversion of ethanol (EtOH) into acetaldehyde in the brain. This centrally formed acetaldehyde has been shown to be involved in some of the psychopharmacological effects induced by EtOH in rodents, including voluntary alcohol intake. It has been observed that different levels of this enzyme in the central nervous system (CNS) result in variations in the amount of EtOH consumed. This has been interpreted to mean that the brain catalase-H2O2 system, by determining EtOH metabolism, mediates alcohol self-administration. To date, however, the role of H2O2 in voluntary EtOH drinking has not been investigated.\n\n\nMethods\n\nIn the present study, we explored the consequence of a reduction in cerebral H2O2 levels in volitional EtOH ingestion. With this end in mind, we injected mice of the C57BL/6J strain intraperitoneally with the H2O2 scavengers alpha-lipoic acid (LA; 0 to 50 mg/kg) or ebselen (Ebs; 0 to 25 mg/kg) 15 or 60 minutes, respectively, prior to offering them an EtOH (10%) solution following a drinking-in-the-dark procedure. The same procedure was followed to assess the selectivity of these compounds in altering EtOH intake by presenting mice with a (0.1%) solution of saccharin. In addition, we indirectly tested the ability of LA and Ebs to reduce brain H2O2 availability.\n\n\nResults\n\nThe results showed that both LA and Ebs dose-dependently reduced voluntary EtOH intake, without altering saccharin consumption. Moreover, we demonstrated that these treatments decreased the central H2O2 levels available to catalase.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nTherefore, we propose that the amount of H2O2 present in the CNS, by determining brain acetaldehyde formation by the catalase-H2O2 system, could be a factor that determines an animal's propensity to consume EtOH.",

		"abstract": "The majority of research has suggested that α-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potential therapeutic agent for chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, a nutritional supplementation with ALA is recommended although the effects of a short- and long-term intake of ALA on central organs in healthy individuals are not studied in detail yet. Therefore, liver tissue of 4 and 74 weeks ALA-treated healthy C57BL6/J mice with respect to lipid metabolism was analyzed. In doing so, it was shown that short-term and long-term ALA treatment caused a marked increase of β-oxidation, as indicated by a significant rise of mRNA expression of fgf21, pparα, and its target genes, for example, acox1, cpt1α, and cpt2, as well as of Fgf21 plasma concentration. Glycolytic activity, as assessed by pklr1 mRNA expression and pyruvate kinase activity, was also found increased. In addition, it was shown that both short- and long-term ALA treatment increased cholesterol content, induced systemic triglyceridemia, and enhanced rxrα and lxrα mRNA expression. Despite the fact that short-term ALA intake reduced lipogenesis, as given by significant declines of fas and srebp1c mRNA expression, and that a long-term ALA intake induced a significant rise of these lipogenic genes, both treatment regimen caused fat accumulation. This, however, was more pronounced upon long-term ALA intake, leading to hepatic steatosis and liver injury, as indicated by increased inflammation and disruption of the general hepatic architecture. In summary, the prophylactic and abundant use of ALA under healthy conditions should be considered with caution. © 2016 BioFactors, 42(2):179–189, 2016",

Mitochondrial β-oxidation, transmembrane potential, intracellular ATP levels and changes in mitochondrial copy number and morphology were analysed. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats were segregated into three experimental groups and fed for 8 weeks with (i) normal chow, (ii) a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet or (iii) an l-carnitine-supplemented MCD diet.\nResults:\nCarnitine prevented FFA-induced apoptosis (16% vs. 3%, P < 0.05). FFA treatment resulted in swollen mitochondria with increased inner matrix density and loss of cristae. However, mitochondria co-treated with carnitine had normal ultrastructure. The mitochondrial DNA copy number was higher in the carnitine treatment group than in the palmitic acid treatment group (375 vs. 221 copies, P < 0.05). The carnitine group showed higher mitochondrial β-oxidation than did the control and palmitic acid treatment groups (597 vs. 432 and 395 ccpm, P < 0.05). Carnitine treatment increased the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and carnitine-lipoic acid further augmented the mRNA expression. In the in vivo model, carnitine-treated rats showed lower alanine transaminase levels and lesser lobular inflammation than did the MCD-treated rats.\nConclusions:\nCarnitine and carnitine-lipoic acid prevent lipotoxicity by increasing mitochondrial β-oxidation and reducing intracellular oxidative stress.",

		"abstract": "R(+)-alpha-lipoic acid is a natural occurring compound that acts as an essential cofactor for certain dehydrogenase complexes. The redox couple alpha-lipoic acid/dihydrolipoic acid possesses potent antioxidant activity. Exogenous racemic alpha-lipoic acid orally administered for the symptomatic treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy is readily and nearly completely absorbed, with a limited absolute bioavailability of about 30% caused by high hepatic extraction. Although the pharmacokinetics of the parent drug have been well characterized in humans, relatively little is known regarding the excretion of alpha-lipoic acid and the pharmacokinetics of any metabolites in humans. In the present study, plasma concentration-time courses, urinary excreted amounts, and pharmacokinetic parameters of alpha-lipoic acid metabolites were evaluated in 9 healthy volunteers after multiple once-daily oral administration of 600 mg racemic alpha-lipoic acid. The primary metabolic pathways of alpha-lipoic acid in man, S-methylation and β-oxidation, were quantitatively confirmed by an HPLC-electrochemical assay newly established prior to the beginning of this study. Major circulating metabolites were the S-methylated β-oxidation products 4,6-bismethylthio-hexanoic acid and 2,4-bismethylthio-butanoic acid, whereas its conjugated forms accounted for the major portion excreted in urine. There was no statistically significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC, and tmax between day 1 and day 4. Despite the prolonged half-lives of the major metabolites compared to the parent drug, no evidence of accumulation was found. Mean values of 12.4% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine after 24 hours as the sum of alpha-lipoic acid and its metabolites. The results of the present study revealed that urinary excretion of alpha-lipoic acid and five of its main metabolites does not play a significant role in the elimination of alpha-lipoic acid. Therefore, biliary excretion, further electrochemically inactive degradation products, and complete utilization of alpha-lipoic acid as a primary substrate in the endogenous metabolism should be considered.",

These changes were of no toxicological significance. The only notable finding in rats of both sexes dosed at 180mg/kg bw/day was a reduction in food intake relative to the controls and a concomitant decrease in body weight. This decrease in body weight led to significant differences between the control and high-dose rats with respect to the absolute weights of certain organs.

Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group) and LA (10, 20 or 30mg/kg, i.p., LA10, LA20 and LA30 groups, respectively). After the treatments all groups were observed for 24h. In LA20 group only there was a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation level. However, no alteration was observed in SOD activity in groups treated with LA. The NE and DA levels were increased only in 20mg/kg dose of LA in rat hippocampus. Serotonin content and their metabolite 5-HIAA levels was decreased in same dose of LA. On the other hand, DOPAC and HVA levels did not show any significant change. The reduction in lipid peroxidation level and alterations in hippocampal monoamines can be suggested as a possible brain mechanism from this antioxidant. The outcome of the study may have therapeutic implications in the neurodegenerative diseases.",

		"abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatosis is an important hepatic complication of obesity linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Furthermore, lipoic acid has been reported to have beneficial effects on mitochondrial function. In this study, we analyzed the potential protective effect of lipoic acid supplementation against the development of nonalcoholic steatosis associated with a long-term high-fat diet feeding and the potential mechanism of this effect. Wistar rats were fed on a standard diet (n=10), a high-fat diet (n=10) and a high-fat diet supplemented with lipoic acid (n=10). A group pair-fed to the latter group (n=6) was also included. Lipoic acid prevented hepatic triglyceride accumulation and liver damage in rats fed a high-fat diet (−68%±11.3% vs. obese group) through the modulation of genes involved in lipogenesis and mitochondrial β-oxidation and by improving insulin sensitivity. Moreover, this molecule showed an inhibitory action on electron transport chain complexes activities (P<.01–P<.001) and adenosine triphosphate synthesis (P<.05), and reduced significantly energy efficiency. By contrast, lipoic acid induced an increase in mitochondrial copy number and in Ucp2 gene expression (P<.001 vs. obese). In summary, this investigation demonstrated the ability of lipoic acid to prevent nonalcoholic steatosis induced by a high-fat intake. Finally, the novelty and importance of this study are the finding of how lipoic acid modulates some of the mitochondrial processes involved in energy homeostasis. The reduction in mitochondrial energy efficiency could also explain, at least in part, the beneficial effects of lipoic acid not only in fatty liver but also in preventing excessive body weight gain.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol excites dopamine (DA) neurons in the posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). This effect is responsible for ethanol's motivational properties and may contribute to alcoholism. Evidence indicates that catalase-mediated conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde in pVTA plays a critical role in this effect. Acetaldehyde, in the presence of DA, condensates with it to generate salsolinol. Salsolinol, when administered in pVTA, excites pVTA DA cells, elicits DA transmission in nucleus accumbens and sustains its self-administration in pVTA. Here we show, by using ex vivo electrophysiology, that ethanol and acetaldehyde, but not salsolinol, failed to stimulate pVTA DA cell activity in mice administered α-methyl-p-tyrosine, a DA biosynthesis inhibitor that reduces somatodendritic DA release. This effect was specific for ethanol and acetaldehyde since morphine, similarly to salsolinol, was able to excite pVTA DA cells in α-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated mice. However, when DA was bath applied in slices from α-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated mice, ethanol-induced excitation of pVTA DA neurons was restored. This effect requires ethanol oxidation into acetaldehyde given that, when H2O2-catalase system was impaired by either 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or in vivo administration of α-lipoic acid, ethanol did not enhance DA cell activity. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of bath medium detected salsolinol only after co-application of ethanol and DA in α-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated mice. These results demonstrate the relationship between ethanol and salsolinol effects on pVTA DA neurons, help to untangle the mechanism(s) of action of ethanol in this area and contribute to an exciting research avenue prosperous of theoretical and practical consequences.",

		"abstract": "This purpose of this review will be to summarize the interactions between the endogenous amino acid taurine and ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in the central nervous system (CNS). Taurine is one of the most abundant amino acids in the CNS and plays an integral role in physiological processes such as osmoregulation, neuroprotection and neuromodulation. Both taurine and ethanol exert positive allosteric modulatory effects on neuronal ligand-gated chloride channels (i.e., GABA(A) and glycine receptors) as well as inhibitory effects on other ligand- and voltage-gated cation channels (i.e., NMDA and Ca(2+) channels). Behavioral evidence suggests that taurine can alter the locomotor stimulatory, sedating, and motivational effects of ethanol in a strongly dose-dependent manner. Microdialysis studies have revealed that ethanol elevates extracellular levels of taurine in numerous brain regions, although the functional consequences of this phenomenon are currently unknown. Finally, taurine and several related molecules including the homotaurine derivative acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) can reduce ethanol self-administration and relapse to drinking in both animals and humans. Taken together, these data suggest that the endogenous taurine system may be an important modulator of effects of ethanol on the nervous system, and may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the development of medications to treat alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol has deleterious effects on neuronal cells both in vivo and in vitro, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, treatment with increasing doses of ethanol (from 20 up to 600mM) decreased the viability of a mouse hippocampal neuroblastoma cell line, HT22. The glutathione concentration decreased and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in a dose-and time-dependent manner, suggesting that the neurotoxicity was due to oxidative stress. Expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a redox regulator and heat shock protein, increased with time after ethanol treatment, but HO-2 was expressed constitutively. The addition of 5μM zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX), a competitive HO inhibitor, with the ethanol further reduced cell viability and increased intracellular ROS, but these effects were reversed by co-treatment with 50nM bilirubin, a well-known antioxidant and a product of HO catalysis. These results suggest that HO has a protective role in hippocampal neurons as an intrinsic factor against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and the protection depends on the degree of oxidative stress.",

Ethanol itself and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by ethanol modulate intracellular signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. This study was conducted to examine the impact of ethanol on MAPK signaling in HT22 cells. Ethanol (100 and 400mM) caused activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK. ERK activation occurred in early time and p38 MAPK activation was evident when ERK activation was diminished. Specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) protected HT22 cells against ethanol, which was accompanied by an inhibition of ROS accumulation. However, inhibitors of ERK (U0126) and JNK (SP600125) had no effects on ethanol-induced neuronal cell death when they are treated with ethanol for 24h. These results suggest that p38 MAPK may have important roles in ROS accumulation during ethanol-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells.",

The FDD+MeOH and FDD+LPA+MeOH animals were injected intraperitoneally with methanol (3gm/kg). After 24h, the level of free radical scavengers such as, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione was estimated in six discrete regions of brain, retina and optic nerve. Level of protein thiol, protein carbonyl and lipid peroxidation was also estimated. Expression of heat shock protein 70 mRNA (hsp70) was studied in the cerebellum and hippocampus by reverse transcriptase PCR. All the samples showed elevation in the level of free radical scavenging enzymes and reduced level of glutathione in the FDD+MeOH group in relation to the other groups. hsp70 expression was more in FDD+MeOH group when compared to FDD+LPA+MeOH group. In conclusion, MeOH exposure leads to increased free radical generation and protein oxidative damages in the rat nervous tissue. Treatment with LPA prevents oxidative damage induced by MeOH exposure.",

		"abstract": "The effect of DL-α-lipoic acid on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes were evaluated in various brain regions of young and aged rats. Lipoate contents of discrete brain regions were also measured. In aged rats, the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were low whereas thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were found to be high. Catalase activity in various brain regions was little altered in aged rats. Lipoic acid an antioxidant was administered intraperitoneally (100mg/kg body weight per day) for 7 and 14 days. Lipoate administered aged rats showed a duration dependent reduction in the level of lipid peroxidation and elevation in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. There was a rise in the level of lipoate in aged rats after supplementation of lipoate in all the brain regions examined. From our results we conclude that lipoate supplementation had a beneficial effect in both preventing and reversing abnormalities in ageing brain. This beneficial effect was associated with normalization of lipid peroxidation and partial restoration in the activities of various enzymatic antioxidants suggesting that lipoate supplementation could improve brain antioxidant functions in the elderly.",

		"abstract": "Background\n\nOverproduction of reactive oxygen species is associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Plant polyphenols have been used as dietary interventions for multiple diseases including ALD. The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary supplementation with fisetin, a novel flavonoid, exerts beneficial effect on alcohol-induced liver injury.\n\n\nMethods\n\nC57BL/6J mice were pair-fed with the Lieber-DeCarli control or ethanol (EtOH) diet for 4 weeks with or without fisetin supplementation at 10 mg/kg/d.\n\n\nResults\n\nAlcohol feeding induced lipid accumulation in the liver and increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, which were attenuated by fisetin supplementation. The EtOH concentrations in the plasma and liver were significantly elevated by alcohol exposure but were reduced by fisetin supplementation. Although fisetin did not affect the protein expression of alcohol metabolism enzymes, the aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were significantly increased by fisetin compared to the alcohol alone group. In addition, fisetin supplementation remarkably reduced hepatic NADPH oxidase 4 levels along with decreased plasma hydrogen peroxide and hepatic superoxide and 4-hydroxynonenal levels after alcohol exposure. Alcohol-induced apoptosis and up-regulation of Fas and cleaved caspase-3 in the liver were prevented by fisetin. Moreover, fisetin supplementation attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis through increasing plasma adiponectin levels and hepatic protein levels of p-AMPK, ACOX1, CYP4A, and MTTP.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study demonstrated that the protective effect of fisetin on ALD is achieved by accelerating EtOH clearance and inhibition of oxidative stress. The data suggest that fisetin has a therapeutical potential for treating ALD.",

		"abstract": "Human red cell membranes (ghosts) were treated by 5 min of incubation with fasting or hypo- and hyperglycemic concentrations ofD-glucose. This simulation of nondiabetic or diabetic conditions revealed an influence on membrane fluidity and on protein -SH reactivity. Protein -SH groups, measured with Ellman's reagent, generally behave in the same way as membrane fluidity determined with diphenylhexatriene. Maximal values were obtained with 5 mM D-glucose, whereas decrease was observed above 10 mM D-glucose. Addition of α-lipoic acid (4 nmol/mg protein) resulted in a significant increase in membrane fluidity and titratable -SH groups at glucose concentrations of 10 mMand above. Dithiothreitol diminished titrable -SH groups and did not restore membrane fluidity. 2-Mercaptopropionylglycine was only effective in restoration of -SH groups. By contrast toD-glucose, other sugars such asL-glucose,D-fructose, or sucrose revealed no comparable changes on membrane fluidity and titratable membrane -SH groups between concentrations of 5 and 10 mM. The hyperglycemic effects ofD-glucose were corroborated with isolated, reconstituted membrane proteins and erythrocyte glucose carrier, indicating that, in general, the observed divergent biochemical/biophysical changes of the red cell membrane are influenced by the glucose transport protein GluT1. The naturalR-form and theS-form of α-lipoic acid were compared with racemicR-/S-forms for their efficiencies in alterations of red cell membrane fluidity. Decreased fluidities in presence of 10 mMglucose were found to be influenced in differentiated ways: theS-form was highly active in increasing fluidity at 4 nmol/mg and increasingly less active up to 20 nmol/mg protein. By contrast theR-form of lipoic acid was moderately efficient in increasing fluidity through a larger concentration range between 4 and 80 nmol/mg protein.",

		"abstract": "Recent evidence supports the influence of neuroimmune system activation on behavior. We have demonstrated that ethanol activates the innate immune system by stimulating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in glial cells, which triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and causes neuroinflammation. The present study aimed to evaluate whether the ethanol-induced up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines is associated with anxiety-related behavior, 24 h after ethanol removal, and if TLR4 or TLR2 is involved in these effects. We used WT, TLR4-KO and TLR2-KO mice treated with alcohol for 5 months to show that chronic ethanol consumption increases the levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-17, TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α, CX3CL1) in the striatum and serum (MCP-1, MIP-1α, CX3CL1) of WT mice. Alcohol deprivation for 24 h induces IFN-γ levels in the striatum and maintains high levels of some cytokines (IL-1β, IL-17) and chemokines (MIP-1α, CX3CL1) in this brain region. The latter events were associated with an increase in anxiogenic-related behavior, as evaluated by the dark and light box and the elevated plus maze tests. Notably, mice lacking TLR4 or TLR2 receptors are largely protected against ethanol-induced cytokine and chemokine release, and behavioral associated effects during alcohol abstinence. These data support the role of TLR4 and TLR2 responses in neuroinflammation and in anxiogenic-related behavior effects during ethanol deprivation, and also provide evidence that chemokines and cytokines can be biomarkers of ethanol-induced neuroimmune response.",

In addition, it has been suggested that the cAMP-PKA signaling transduction pathway plays an important role in the modulation of several ethanol-induced behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesized that acetaldehyde might be ultimately responsible for the activation of this intracellular pathway. We used three pharmacological agents that modify acetaldehyde activity (α-lipoic acid, aminotriazole, and d-penicillamine) to study the role of this metabolite on EtOH-induced PKA activation in mice. Our results show that the injection of α-lipoic acid, aminotriazole and d-penicillamine prior to acute EtOH administration effectively blocks the PKA-enhanced response to EtOH in the brain. These results strongly support the hypothesis of a selective release of acetaldehyde-dependent Ca2+ as the mechanism involved in the neurobehavioral effects elicited by EtOH.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: This investigation elucidates the role of free radicals in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal erosion and the protective effect of lipoic acid.\nMETHODS: After overnight fasting, Wistar albino rats were orally treated with 1 ml of absolute ethanol to induce gastric erosion. Lipoic acid (100 mg/kg) was given orally for 3 days before ethanol administration. Mucosal damage was evaluated 1 h after ethanol administration by macroscopic examination and histological analysis. Additional tissue samples were taken for measurement of malondialdehyde, glutathione (GSH), and myeloperoxidase activity. Production of reactive oxidants and oxidant-induced DNA fragmentation and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity were also assayed in the tissue samples.\nRESULTS: Generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation associated with neutrophil infiltration play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal damage induced by ethanol. Furthermore, oxidants depleted tissue GSH stores and impaired membrane structure as Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited. On the other hand, lipoic acid treatment reversed all these biochemical indices as well as the histopathological changes induced by ethanol.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that lipoic acid administration effectively counteracts the deleterious effect of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury and attenuates gastric damage through its antioxidant effects.",

Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to ALD, which is characterized by steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. Recent studies suggest that alcohol induces both cell death and adaptive cell survival pathways in the liver, and the balance of cell death and cell survival ultimately decides the pathogenesis of ALD. This review summarizes the recent progress on the role and mechanisms of apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in the pathogenesis of ALD.

By reacting with H2O2, brain catalase forms compound I (the catalase-H2O2 system), which is able to oxidize EtOH to acetaldehyde (ACD) in the brain. We have previously shown that ACD regulates EtOH motivational properties and possesses reinforcing effects by itself. In this study, we investigate the effects of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a scavenging agent for H2O2, on oral EtOH self-administration.\n\n\nMethods\n\nTo this end, we trained Wistar rats to orally self-administer EtOH (10%) by nose poking. The effect of intraperitoneal pretreatment with ALA was evaluated during (i) maintenance of EtOH self-administration, (ii) EtOH self-administration under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement, and (iii) oral EtOH priming to induce reinstatement of EtOH seeking behavior. Moreover, we tested the effect of ALA on saccharin (0.05%) reinforcement, as assessed by oral self-administration.\n\n\nResults\n\nThe results indicate that ALA dose-dependently reduced the maintenance, the break point of EtOH self-administration under a PR and the reinstatement of EtOH seeking behavior without suppressing saccharin self-administration.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThese results support that ALA may have a potential use in alcoholism treatment.",

		"abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can be attributed to the imbalance between lipogenesis and lipolysis in the liver. Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to activate the 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway and to effectively inhibit the lipogenesis pathway in liver. However, whether alpha-lipoic acid stimulates lipolysis remains unclear. Recently, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was shown to be responsible for triacylglycerol hydrolase activity in cells. In the present study, we established a fatty liver cell model by incubating HepG2 cells in a high glucose (30mM glucose) and high fat (0.1mM palmitate) medium. We found that the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway induced ATGL protein expression and enhanced lipid hydrolysis. Similarly, treatment of the fatty liver cell model with alpha-lipoic acid reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, increased AMPK phosphorylation, and induced ATGL expression. We showed that insulin phosphorylates the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), which regulates ATGL expression and inhibits FOXO1 translocation into the nucleus. In contrast, alpha-lipoic acid dephosphorylated FOXO1 and reversed the nuclear exclusion of FOXO1. These data suggest that alpha-lipoic acid can effectively ameliorate intracellular lipid accumulation and induce ATGL expression through the FOXO1/ATGL pathway in liver cells. Thus, alpha-lipoic acid may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating fatty liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Fatty liver is common in obese subjects with insulin resistance. Hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which plays a major role in hepatic steatosis, is regulated by multiple factors, including insulin, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK), liver X receptors (LXRs), and specificity protein 1. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring antioxidant, has been shown to decrease lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle by activating AMPK. Here we show that ALA decreases hepatic steatosis and SREBP-1c expression in rats on a high fat diet or given an LXR agonist. ALA increased AMPK phosphorylation in the liver and in cultured liver cells, and dominant-negative AMPK partially prevented ALA-induced suppression of insulin-stimulated SREBP-1c expression. ALA also inhibited DNA-binding activity and transcriptional activity of both specificity protein 1 and LXR. Conclusion: These results show that ALA prevents fatty liver disease through multiple mechanisms, and suggest that ALA can be used to prevent the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with insulin resistance.

		"abstract": "Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has become a common ingredient in multivitamin formulas, anti-aging supplements, and even pet food. It is well-defined as a therapy for preventing diabetic polyneuropathies, and scavenges free radicals, chelates metals, and restores intracellular glutathione levels which otherwise decline with age. How do the biochemical properties of LA relate to its biological effects? Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of LA discovered using cell and animal models, and the effects of LA on human subjects. Though LA has long been touted as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to improve glucose and ascorbate handling, increase eNOS activity, activate Phase II detoxification via the transcription factor Nrf2, and lower expression of MMP-9 and VCAM-1 through repression of NF-kappa B. LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides. Beneficial effects are achieved with low micromolar levels of LA, suggesting that some of its therapeutic potential extends beyond the strict definition of an antioxidant. Current trials are investigating whether these beneficial properties of LA make it an appropriate treatment not just for diabetes, but also for the prevention of vascular disease, hypertension, and inflammation.",

		"abstract": "Agmatine, a cationic amine formed by decarboxylation of l-arginine by the mitochondrial enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC), is widely but unevenly distributed in mammalian tissues. Agmatine in the tissues originates from cellular enzymatic de novo synthesis and from agmatine absorbed from the lumen of the gut. Absorption from the gut and accumulation in the tissues and cells must occur via a specific carrier mechanism because the compound is charged at physiologic pH and, hence, biological membranes are almost completely impermeable to the organic cation in the absence of an uptake system. Agmatine initially attracted attention as an endogenous ligand at imidazoline receptors and α(2)-adrenoceptors. However, independent of binding to those receptors, agmatine induces a variety of physiological and pharmacological effects exhibiting a great therapeutic potential of the compound. Although the precise function of endogenous agmatine is presently still unclear, this review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the physiological and pathophysiological function of agmatine.",

		"abstract": "Endothelial activation and monocyte adhesion are initiating steps in atherogenesis thought to be caused in part by oxidative stress. The metabolic thiol antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has been suggested to be of therapeutic value in pathologies associated with redox imbalances. We investigated the role of (R)-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) vs. glutathione and ascorbic acid in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) -induced adhesion molecule expression and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Preincubation of HAEC for 48 h with LA (0.05-1 mmol/l) dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha (10 U/ml) -induced adhesion of human monocytic THP-1 cells, as well as mRNA and protein expression of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. LA also strongly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 but did not affect expression of TNF-alpha receptor 1. Furthermore, LA dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activation, subsequent degradation of IkappaB, the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitor, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and adhesion molecule expression were not affected by ascorbic acid or by manipulating cellular glutathione status with l-2-oxo-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, or d,l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine. Our data show that clinically relevant concentrations of LA, but neither vitamin C nor glutathione, inhibit adhesion molecule expression in HAEC and monocyte adhesion by inhibiting the IkappaB/NF-kappaB signaling pathway at the level, or upstream, of IkappaB kinase.",

We investigated the interplay between lipoic acid and glutathione in microsomal Fe2+ (10 microM)/ascorbate (0.2 mM)-induced lipid peroxidation. Neither reduced nor oxidized lipoic acid (0.5 mM) displayed protection against microsomal lipid peroxidation, measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive material. Reduced lipoic acid even had a pro-oxidant activity, which is probably due to reduction of Fe3+. Notably, protection against lipid peroxidation was afforded by the combination of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced lipoic acid. It is shown that this effect can be ascribed completely to reduction of GSSG to GSH by reduced lipoic acid. This may provide a rationale for the therapeutic effectiveness of lipoic acid.",

In addition, an injection solution containing 200 mg of alpha-lipoic acid was administered. Plasma concentrations of alpha-lipoic acid were determined using a validated reversed-phase HPLC method with electrochemical detection having a lower limit of quantitation of 1 ng/ml. The areas under curve (AUC) were 46.82 +/- 21.46 and 157.97 +/- 35.05 microg x min/ml for the oral and intravenous administration of 200 mg, respectively.\nRESULTS: The AUC following oral administration of 600 mg was 157.83 +/- 35.82 microg x min/ml. The difference in mean t(1/2) for the two oral doses and the i.v. dose (in the range of 25.3-32.7 min) was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: The lack of a significant difference between values for apparent total plasma clearance for the 200 and 600 mg doses indicates non-saturable kinetics of alpha-lipoic acid in healthy volunteers in this dose range. The absolute bioavailability after the 200 mg dose was 29.1 +/- 10.3%.",

		"abstract": "It is well known that ethanol damages the developing nervous system by augmenting apoptosis. Previously, this laboratory reported that ethanol augments apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons, and that the increased apoptosis is associated with reduced activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3’kinase pathway and downstream expression of pro-survival genes. Other laboratories have shown that another mechanism by which ethanol induces apoptosis in developing neurons is through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the associated oxidative stress., The present study used an in vitro model to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of several antioxidants against ethanol-associated apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons. The investigated antioxidants included three phenolics: (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a flavanoid polyphenol found in green tea; curcumin, found in tumeric; and resveratrol (3,5,4’-trihydroxystilbene), a component of red wine. Additional antioxidants, including melatonin, a naturally occurring indole, and α-lipoic acid, a naturally occurring dithiol, were also investigated., These studies demonstrated that a 24-hour treatment of fetal rhombencephalic neurons with 75 mM ethanol caused a 3-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic neurons. However, co-treatment of these cultures with any of the five different antioxidants prevented ethanol-associated apoptosis. Antioxidant treatment did not alter the extent of apoptosis in control neurons, i.e., those cultured in the absence of ethanol. These studies showed that several classes of antioxidants can exert neuroprotection against ethanol-associated apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons.",

Recent studies have described a neuroprotective potential of α-lipoic acid (LC) in several models of neuronal cell death related to oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that LC could be effective in preventing ethanol-induced neurotoxicity employing the clonal hippocampa cell line HT22. A 24 h incubation with ethanol 100–600 mM caused a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and a significant increase of the overall intracellular protein oxidation. Coincubation with LC 0.1 mM resulted in a significant decrease of ethanol-related neurotoxicity and a complete prevention of the ethanol-induced intracellular protein oxidation. These results indicate that the radical scavenging properties of LC are effective to ameliorate ethanol-induced neurotoxicity.",

Alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA), a natural dithiol compound with antioxidant properties, has been reported to increase ALDH2 activity in cultured cells.  We analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of α-LA in 63 patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  These patients (52 men and 11 women, with age range 49-72 years) were randomized into two groups: untreated group (n = 30) and α-LA group (n = 33).  Patients in the α-LA group were given an intravenous injection of 600 mg α-LA every day for 5 days while the patients in the untreated group were given saline.  An isoprostane, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), one product of arachidonic acid metabolism, was measured as a marker for oxidative stress.  The serum levels of 8-iso-PGF2α and ALDH2 activity were determined at admission to the hospital (time 0), and at 24 hours and 1 week after treatment.  At 24 hours and 1 week after treatment, ALDH2 activity was significantly higher in the α-LA group than in the untreated group (P < 0.05), whereas the levels of 8-iso-PGF2α were significantly lower in the α-LA group than in the untreated group (all P < 0.05).  Importantly, the decrease of 8-iso-PGF2α levels correlated with the increased ALDH2 activity at both 24 hours (r = 0.6234, P < 0.001) and 1 week after treatment (r = −0.3941, P = 0.0014).  α-LA may ameliorate oxidative stress through up-regulating ALDH2 activity in patients with ACS.",

Compared with wild-type mice, ethanol-fed ALDH2(-/-) mice had higher levels of malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adduct and greater hepatic inflammation, with higher hepatic interleukin (IL)-6 expression but surprisingly lower levels of steatosis and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Higher IL-6 levels were also detected in ethanol-treated precision-cut liver slices from ALDH2(-/-) mice and in Kupffer cells isolated from ethanol-fed ALDH2(-/-) mice than those levels in wild-type mice. In vitro incubation with MAA enhanced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated stimulation of IL-6 production in Kupffer cells. In agreement with these findings, hepatic activation of the major IL-6 downstream signaling molecule signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was higher in ethanol-fed ALDH2(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. An additional deletion of hepatic STAT3 increased steatosis and hepatocellular damage in ALDH2(-/-) mice. Finally, ethanol-fed ALDH2(-/-) mice were more prone to CCl4-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis than ethanol-fed wild-type mice. Conclusion: ALDH2(-/-) mice are resistant to ethanol-induced steatosis but prone to inflammation and fibrosis by way of MAA-mediated paracrine activation of IL-6 in Kupffer cells. These findings suggest that alcohol, by way of acetaldehyde and its associated adducts, stimulates hepatic inflammation and fibrosis independent from causing hepatocyte death, and that ALDH2-deficient individuals may be resistant to steatosis and blood ALT elevation, but are prone to liver inflammation and fibrosis following alcohol consumption.",

In the present study, the antitumor effect of the total flavonoids of A. exilis (TFAE) against HepG2 cells was evaluated. The results showed that TFAE inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in a dosage-and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence staining results showed that TFAE could significantly increase the apoptosis ratio of HepG2 cells, which is accompanied with increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m). Western blotting indicated that TFAE downregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, increased cytochrome c release, and activated the caspases-3 and -9. Further analysis showed that TFAE stimulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, treatment with NAC (reactive oxygen species scavenger) and MAPK-specific inhibitors (SP600125 and SB203580) could reverse the changes of these apoptotic-related proteins. These results suggested that TFAE possessed potential anticancer activity in HepG2 cells through ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction involving MAPK pathway.",

Our previous results have found that oleanolic acid (OA), a liver protective agent, plays a potent antioxidant activity in hepatocyte. In the present study, the protective effects of OA co-administration on ethanol-induced oxidative injury in rats were investigated through detecting hepatic histopathology, antioxidant enzymes, ethanol metabolic enzymes and inflammatory factors. Preventions of ethanol-induced oxidative injury by OA were reflected by markedly decreased serum activities of AST, ALT and significantly increased the hepatic ATP level. In addition, the increase of the hepatic TG content, MDA level and the decrease of hepatic GSH level, SOD activity, CAT activity induced by ethanol were significantly inhibited by OA co-administration. Furthermore, OA could also elevate the protein expressions and nuclear translocation of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf-2 and then up-regulated antioxidant enzymes expressions of HO-1, SOD-1 and GR. Moreover, OA co-administration can significantly reduce the activity and expressions of CYP2E1 and ADH, which has characteristic of generation ROS mediated oxidative stress and acetaldehyde respectively. Furthermore, OA co-administration could inhibition of the generation of inflammatory factors TNE-alpha and IL-6. Those above results indicated that OA co-administration can protect rats against ethanol-induced liver injury by induction Nrf-2 related antioxidant to maintain redox balance and modulating the ethanolmetabolizing and inflammatory pathway.

Contradictory findings suggest a role for the outer BRB in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the mechanisms involved in these alterations are sensitive to nitrosative stress, and if cocoa or epicatechin (EC) protects from this damage under diabetic (DM) milieu conditions. METHODS. Cells of a human RPE line (ARPE-19) were exposed to high-glucose (HG) conditions for 24 hours in the presence or absence of cocoa powder containing 0.5% or 60.5% polyphenol (low-polyphenol cocoa [LPC] and high-polyphenol cocoa [HPC], respectively). RESULTS. Exposure to HG decreased claudin-1 and occludin TJ expressions and increased extracellular matrix accumulation (ECM), whereas levels of TNF-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were upregulated, accompanied by increased nitric oxide levels. This nitrosative stress resulted in S-nitrosylation of caveolin-1 (CAV-1), which in turn increased CAV-1 traffic and its interactions with claudin-1 and occludin. This cascade was inhibited by treatment with HPC or EC through delta-opioid receptor (DOR) binding and stimulation, thereby decreasing TNF-alpha-induced iNOS upregulation and CAV-1 endocytosis. The TJ functions were restored, leading to prevention of paracellular permeability, restoration of resistance of the ARPE-19 monolayer, and decreased ECM accumulation. CONCLUSIONS.

		"abstract": "Resveratrol is a strong antioxidant that exhibits blood glucose-lowering effects, which might contribute to its usefulness in preventing complications associated with diabetes. The present study aimed to investigate resveratrol effects on catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) gene and protein expression, their phosphorylation states and activities in rat liver of STZ-induced diabetes. Diabetes increased the levels of total protein phosphorylation and p-CAT, while mRNA expression, protein levels, and activity were reduced. Although diabetes induced transcriptional repression over GPx, it did not affect the protein levels and activity. When resveratrol was administered to diabetic rats, an increase in activity was associated with an increase in p-GPx levels. Decrease in Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and increase in nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) gene expression in diabetes were associated with a decrease in CAT and GPx mRNA expression. A possible compensatory mechanism for reduced gene expression of antioxidant enzymes is proved to be nuclear translocation of redox-sensitive Nrf2 and NF kappa B in diabetes which is confirmed by the increase in nuclear and decrease in cytoplasmic protein levels of Nrf2 and NF kappa B. Taken together, these findings revealed that an increase in the oxidized state in diabetes intricately modified the cellular phosphorylation status and regulation of antioxidant enzymes. Gene regulation of antioxidant enzymes was accompanied by nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and NF kappa B. Resveratrol administration also activated a coordinated cytoprotective response against diabetes-induced changes in liver tissues.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) spectrum, which progresses to the end stage liver disease. A common denominator in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is increased oxidative stress. Hepatic induction of the pro-oxidant enzyme Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) occurs in both NAFLD and type-2 diabetes. In this study, the comparative effect of pioglitazone, quercetin and hydroxy citric acid on liver CYP2E1 enzyme levels in experimentally induced NASH has been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental protocol consists of 5 groups viz. Control (n = 6); NASH Induced (n=6); NASH + Pioglitazone (n= 6); NASH + Quercetin (n=6); NASH + Hydroxy Citric Acid (n=6). CYP2E1 enzyme levels were detected in liver by immunoblot analysis in all the groups. RESULTS: CYP2E1 catalytic activity was increased in experimentally induced NASH group compared to control group as evidenced by the Immunoblot analysis. It revealed low CYP2E1 in the experimentally induced NASH, treated with pioglitazone, quercetin and hydroxy citric acid. Mild decrease in the CYP2E1 level was observed in experimental NASH treated with pioglitazone compared to NASH group. Treatment with hydroxy citric acid also showed mild decrease in the levels of CYP2E1. On contrary to the action of pioglitazone and hydroxy citric acid, quercetin showed an approximate 2-fold decrease in the level of CYP2E1 in experimental NASH treated with quercetin compared to NASH group. CONCLUSIONS: Being a powerful antioxidant, quercetin offers absolute protection to liver against NASH by reducing the levels of CYP2E1 and, thereby, reducing CYP2E1 mediated oxidative stress, which is believed to be the one of the key factor in the pathogenesis of NASH. On the other hand, pioglitazone and hydroxy citric acid exerted limited effect on the levels of CYP2E1. This study showed the therapeutic value of quercetin, pioglitazone and hydroxy citric acid in treating NASH.",

		"abstract": "Emerging evidence has displayed that oxygen free radicals especially ones promoted by \"free\" iron play an important role in the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Naturally-occurring quercetin has been reported to prevent ALD and iron overload-induced damage aside from the \"free\" iron. The purpose was to explore the potential mechanisms by which quercetin arrests alcohol-induced \"free\" iron disorder. Chronic alcohol (30% of total calories) or iron (0.2%)-fed adult male C57BL/J mice for 15 weeks resulted in significantly elevated levels of hepatic iron, labile iron pool-Fe and serum non-transferrin bound iron, accompanied with sustained oxidative damage. The hepatotoxicity was further exacerbated by ethanol and iron. Quercetin (100 mg/kg. body weight) alleviated the detrimental effects induced by ethanol and/or iron. The expressions of divalent metal transporter 1, zinc transporter member 14, mucolipin 1, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin were up-regulated by ethanol and/or iron, which were partially normalized by quercetin. Quercetin prevented ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, which may be partially attributed to the alleviated disorder of bound iron and \"free\" iron. The significant suppression of ethanol-stimulated molecules for \"free\" iron uptake and release may contribute to the hepatoprotective effect of quercetin, although TfR1-mediated physiological pathway of iron uptake also played a role.

		"abstract": "The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been identified as a major, druggable regulator of melanoma. Mutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human melanoma, resulting in constitutive melanoma hyperproliferation. A selective BRAF inhibitor showed remarkable clinical activity in patients with mutated BRAF. Unfortunately, most patients acquire resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, highlighting the urgent need for new melanoma treatment strategies. Green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cell proliferation independently of BRAF inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that increased understanding of the anti-melanoma activity of EGCG may provide a novel therapeutic target. Here, by performing functional genetic screening, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a critical factor in the suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. We demonstrated that tumor-overexpressed 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) activates PP2A through adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway eliciting inhibitions of oncoproteins and activation of tumor suppressor Merlin. Activating 67LR/PP2A pathway leading to melanoma-specific mTOR inhibition shows strong synergy with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in the drug-resistant melanoma. Moreover, SET, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, is overexpressed on malignant melanoma. Silencing of SET enhances 67LR/PP2A signaling. Collectively, activation of 67LR/PP2A signaling may thus be a novel rational strategy for melanoma-specific treatment.",

		"abstract": "We present a useful ammonia gas sensor based on chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets by self-assembly technique to create conductive networks between parallel Au electrodes. Negative graphene oxide (GO) sheets with large sizes (> 10 mu m) can be easily electrostatically attracted onto positive Au electrodes modified with cysteamine hydrochloride in aqueous solution. The assembled GO sheets on Au electrodes can be directly reduced into rGO sheets by hydrazine or pyrrole vapor and consequently provide the sensing devices based on self-assembled rGO sheets. Preliminary results, which have been presented on the detection of ammonia (NH3) gas using this facile and scalable fabrication method for practical devices, suggest that pyrrole-vapor-reduced rGO exhibits much better (more than 2.7 times with the concentration of NH3 at 50 ppm) response to NH3 than that of rGO reduced from hydrazine vapor. Furthermore, this novel gas sensor based on rGO reduced from pyrrole shows excellent responsive repeatability to NH3. Overall, the facile electrostatic self-assembly technique in aqueous solution facilitates device fabrication, the resultant self-assembled rGO-based sensing devices, with miniature, low-cost portable characteristics and outstanding sensing performances, which can ensure potential application in gas sensing fields.",

MA pre-intake decreased subsequent alcohol-induced reactive oxygen species, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, nitric oxide and prostaglandin E-2 production; retained glutathione content; maintained catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities; and declined cyclooxygenase-2 and total nitric oxide synthase activities in the liver (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MA pre-intake suppressed 17.3-51.7% nuclear factor kappa (NF-kappa)B p50, 23.5-58.8% NF-kappa B p65, 25.6-62.4% p-p38 and 24.1-63.0% p-JNK expression in the liver (P < 0.05).

		"abstract": "Alcohol consumption is customary in many cultures and it is a common human behavior worldwide. Binge ethanol and chronic alcohol consumption, two usual drinking patterns of human beings, produce a state of oxidative stress in liver and disturb the liver function. However, a safe and effective therapy for alcoholic liver disease in humans is still elusive. This study identified the natural product berberine as a potential agent for treating or preventing ethanol-induced liver injury. We demonstrated that berberine attenuated oxidative stress resulted from binge drinking in liver by reducing hepatic lipid peroxidation, glutathione exhaust and mitochondrial oxidative damage. Furthermore, berberine also prevented the oxidative stress and macrosteatosis in response to chronic ethanol exposure in mice. Either the total cytochrome P450 2E1 or the mitochondria-located cytochrome P450 2E1, which is implicated in ethanol-mediated oxidative stress, was suppressed by berberine. On the other hand, berberine significantly blunted the lipid accumulation in liver due to chronic alcohol consumption, at least partially, through restoring peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma Co-activator-1 alpha and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha/microsomal triglyceride transfer protein pathways. These findings suggested that berberine could serve as a potential agent for preventing or treating human alcoholic liver disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "The cytochrome P450 mixed function oxiclase enzymes play a major role in the metabolism of important endogenous substrates as well as in the biotransformation of xenobiotics. The liver P450 system is the most active in metabolism of exogenous substrates. This review briefly describes the liver P450 (CYP) mixed function oxidase system with respect to its enzymatic components and functions. Electron transfer by the NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase is required for reduction of the heme of P450, necessary for binding of molecular oxygen. Binding of substrates to P450 produce substrate binding spectra. The P450 catalytic cycle is complex and rate-limiting steps are not clear. Many types of chemical reactions can be catalyzed by P450 enzymes, making this family among the most diverse catalysts known. There are multiple forms of P450s arranged into families based on structural homology. The major drug metabolizing CYPs are discussed with respect to typical substrates, inducers and inhibitors and their polymorphic forms. The composition of CYPs in humans varies considerably among individuals because of sex and age differences, the influence of diet, liver disease, presence of potential inducers and/or inhibitors. Because of such factors and CYP polymorphisms, and overlapping drug specificity, there is a large variability in the content and composition of P450 enzymes among individuals. This can result in large variations in drug metabolism by humans and often can contribute to drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. Because of many of the above factors, especially CYP polymorphisms, there has been much interest in personalized medicine especially with respect to which CYPs and which of their polymorphic forms are present in order to attempt to determine what drug therapy and what dosage would reflect the best therapeutic strategy in treating individual patients. 2014 The Author.

Our previous study demonstrated that PD markedly resists the progression of diabetic renal fibrosis and thus, inhibits the development of DN. Whereas, whether PD could resist DN through regulating Sirt1 and consequently promoting Nrf2-ARE pathway needs further investigation. Here, we found that concomitant with decreasing RAGE (the specific receptor for AGEs) expression, PD significantly reversed the downregulation of Sirtl in terms of protein expression and deacetylase activity and attenuated FN and TGF-beta 1 expression in GMCs exposed to AGEs. Under AGEs-treatment condition, PD could decrease Keap1 expression and promote the nuclear content, ARE-binding ability, and transcriptional activity of Nrf2. In addition,",

		"abstract": "Background: Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial transcription factor mediating protection against oxidants. Nrf2 is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) thereby providing inducible antioxidant defence. Antioxidant properties of Nrf2 are thought to be mainly exerted by stimulating transcription of antioxidant proteins, whereas its effects on ROS production within the cell are uncertain. Methods: Live cell imaging and qPCR in brain hippocampal glio-neuronal cultures and explants slice cultures with graded expression of Nrf2, i.e. Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2-KO), wild-type (WT), and Keap1-knockdown (Keap1-KD). Results: We here show that ROS production in Nrf2-KO cells and tissues is increased compared to their WT counterparts. Mitochondrial ROS production is regulated by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by controlling mitochondrial bioenergetics. Surprisingly, Keap1-KD cells and tissues also showed higher rates of ROS production when compared to WT, although with a smaller magnitude. Analysis of the mRNA expression levels of the two NOX isoforms implicated in brain pathology showed, that NOX2 is dramatically upregulated under conditions of Nrf2 deficiency, whereas NOX4 is upregulated when Nrf2 is constitutively activated (Keap1-KD) to a degree which paralleled the increases in ROS production. Conclusions: These observations suggest that the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway regulates both mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS production through NADPH oxidase. General significance:",

The metabolism of ethanol generates reactive oxygen species, which play a significant role in the deterioration of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Antioxidant phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, regulate the expression of ALD-associated proteins and peptides, namely, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. These plant antioxidants have electrophilic activity and may induce antioxidant enzymes via the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-NF-E2-related factor-2 pathway and antioxidant responsive elements. Furthermore, these antioxidants are reported to alleviate cell injury caused by oxidants or inflammatory cytokines. These phenomena are likely induced via the regulation of mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathways by plant antioxidants, similar to preconditioning in ischemia-reperfusion models. Although the relationship between plant antioxidants and ALD has not been adequately investigated, plant antioxidants may be preventive for ALD because of their electrophilic and regulatory activities in the MAPK pathway.",

Alcohol exposure can promote the growth of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine which may result in accumulation of endotoxin. In addition, alcohol metabolism by Gram negative bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells can result in accumulation of acetaldehyde, which in turn can increase intestinal permeability to endotoxin by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. Alcohol-induced generation of nitric oxide may also contribute to increased permeability to endotoxin by reacting with tubulin, which may cause damage to microtubule cytoskeleton and subsequent disruption of intestinal barrier function. Increased intestinal permeability can lead to increased transfer of endotoxin from the intestine to the liver and general circulation where endotoxin may trigger inflammatory changes in the liver and other organs. Alcohol may also increase intestinal permeability to peptidoglycan which can initiate inflammatory response in liver and other organs. In addition, acute alcohol exposure may potentiate the effect of burn injury on intestinal bacterial growth and permeability. Decreasing the number of Gram negative bacteria in the intestine can result in decreased production of endotoxin as well as acetaldehyde which is expected to decrease intestinal permeability to endotoxin. In addition, intestinal permeability may be preserved by administering epidermal growth factor, L-glutamine, oats supplementation, or zinc thereby preventing the transfer of endotoxin to the general circulation. Thus reducing the number of intestinal Gram negative bacteria and preserving intestinal permeability to endotoxin may attenuate alcoholic liver and other organ injuries.",

For example, the Veterans Administration Cooperative Studies reported that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had a 4-year mortality of >60%. The poor prognosis of ALD implies that preventing disease progression would be more effective than treating end-stage liver disease. An obvious avenue of prevention would be to remove the damaging agent; however, the infamously high rate of recidivism in alcoholics makes maintaining abstinence a difficult treatment goal to prevent ALD. Indeed, although the progression of ALD is well-characterized, there is no universally accepted therapy available to halt or reverse this process in humans. With better understanding of the mechanism(s) and risk factors that mediate the initiation and progression of ALD, rational targeted therapy can be developed to treat or prevent ALD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the established and proposed mechanisms by which chronic alcohol abuse damages the liver and to highlight key signaling events known or hypothesized to mediate these effects.",

We hypothesized that the protective action of methyl donors is mediated by an effect on the oxidative metabolism of alcohol in the liver. Male C57BL/6J mice were administered a control high-fat diet or diet enriched in methyl donors with or without alcohol for 4 weeks using the enteral alcohol feeding model. As expected, attenuation of ALI and an increase in reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione ratio were achieved with methyl donor supplementation. Interestingly, methyl donors led to a 35% increase in blood alcohol elimination rate, and while there was no effect on alcohol metabolism in the stomach, a profound effect on liver alcohol metabolism was observed. The catalase-dependent pathway of alcohol metabolism was induced, yet the increase in CYP2E1 activity by alcohol was blunted, which may be mitigating production of oxidants. Additional factors contributing to the protective effects of methyl donors in ALI were increased activity of low- and high-Km aldehyde dehydrogenases leading to lower hepatic acetaldehyde, maintenance of the efficient mitochondrial energy metabolism, and promotion of peroxisomal β-oxidation. Profound changes in alcohol metabolism represent additional important mechanism of the protective effect of methyl donors in ALI.",

		"abstract": "Background Intestinal barrier dysfunction and translocation of endotoxins are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Exposure to ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde at relatively high concentrations have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelial tight junctions in the conventional two dimensional cell culture models. The present study investigated quantitatively and qualitatively the effects of ethanol at concentrations detected in the blood after moderate ethanol consumption, of its metabolite acetaldehyde and of the combination of both compounds on intestinal barrier function in a three-dimensional cell culture model.   Methods and Findings Caco-2 cells were grown in a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel™) to induce spheroid formation and were then exposed to the compounds at the basolateral side. Morphological differentiation of the spheroids was assessed by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. The barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-labeled dextran from the basal side into the spheroids' luminal compartment using confocal microscopy. Caco-2 cells grown on Matrigel assembled into fully differentiated and polarized spheroids with a central lumen, closely resembling enterocytes in vivo and provide an excellent model to study epithelial barrier functionality. Exposure to ethanol (10–40 mM) or acetaldehyde (25–200 µM) for 3 h, dose-dependently and additively increased the paracellular permeability and induced redistribution of ZO-1 and occludin without affecting cell viability or tight junction-encoding gene expression. Furthermore, ethanol and acetaldehyde induced lysine residue and microtubules hyperacetylation.   Conclusions These results indicate that ethanol at concentrations found in the blood after moderate drinking and acetaldehyde, alone and in combination, can increase the intestinal epithelial permeability. The data also point to the involvement of protein hyperacetylation in ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced loss of tight junctions integrity.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoids possessing both antioxidant and hypolipidemic effect, on ethanol-induced dyslipidemia and oxidative damage focused on mitochondria. Chronic alcohol administration for adult male rats (4.0 g/kg for 90 days) resulted in the leakage of alanine and especially aspartate aminotransferases, and morphological malformation mainly evidenced by sustained lipid infiltration and degenerative changes on mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly alleviated by quercetin (100 mg/kg.bw.) pretreatment. Furthermore, quercetin prophylaxis evidently ameliorated ethanol-stimulated mitochondrial dysfunction manifested by decreased membrane potential and induced permeability transition though suppressing glutathione depletion, enzymatic inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, ROS over-generation, and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. Quercetin, thus, may protect rat, especially hepatic mitochondria, from chronic ethanol toxicity through its hypolipidemic effect and antioxidative role, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for ALD by naturally occurring phytochemicals.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) contributes to increased oxidative stress and steatosis in chronic alcohol-exposure models. However, its role in binge ethanol-induced gut leakiness and hepatic injury is unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the role of CYP2E1 in binge alcohol-induced gut leakiness and the mechanisms of steatohepatitis. Female wild-type (WT) and Cyp2e1-null mice were treated with three doses of binge ethanol (WT-EtOH or Cyp2e1-null-EtOH) (6 g/kg oral gavage at 12-h intervals) or dextrose (negative control). Intestinal histology of only WT-EtOH exhibited epithelial alteration and blebbing of lamina propria while liver histology obtained at 6 h after the last ethanol dose showed elevated steatosis with scattered inflammatory foci. These were accompanied by increased levels of serum endotoxin, hepatic enterobacteria and triglycerides. All these changes including the intestinal histology and hepatic apoptosis, determined by TUNEL assay, were significantly reversed when WT-EtOH mice were treated with the specific inhibitor of CYP2E1 chlormethiazole and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, both of which suppressed the oxidative markers including intestinal CYP2E1. WT-EtOH also exhibited elevated amounts of serum TNF-α, hepatic cytokines, CYP2E1 and lipid peroxidation with decreased levels of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and suppressed aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity. Increased hepatocyte apoptosis with elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and decreased levels of active (phosphorylated) p-AKT, p-AMPK and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), all of which are involved in fat metabolism and inflammation, were observed in WT-EtOH. These changes were significantly attenuated in the corresponding Cyp2e1-null-EtOH mice. These data indicate that both intestinal and hepatic CYP2E1 induced by binge alcohol seem critical in the binge alcohol-mediated increased nitroxidative stress, gut leakage, endotoxemia, and altered fat metabolism, and inflammation, contributing to hepatic apoptosis and steatohepatitis.",

		"abstract": "Previous studies suggested that the hepatoprotective activity of betaine is associated with its effects on sulfur amino acid metabolism. We examined the mechanism by which betaine prevents the progression of alcoholic liver injury and its therapeutic potential. Rats received a liquid ethanol diet for 6 wk. Ethanol consumption elevated serum triglyceride and TNFα levels, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and lipid accumulation in liver. The oxyradical scavenging capacity of liver was reduced, and expression of CD14, TNFα, COX-2, and iNOS mRNAs was induced markedly. These ethanol-induced changes were all inhibited effectively by betaine supplementation. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and glutathione levels, reduced in the ethanol-fed rats, were increased by betaine supplementation. Methionine adenosyltransferase and cystathionine γ-lyase were induced, but cysteine dioxygenase was down-regulated, which appeared to account for the increment in cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis in the rats supplemented with betaine. Betaine supplementation for the final 2 wk of ethanol intake resulted in a similar degree of hepatoprotection, revealing its potential therapeutic value in alcoholic liver. It is concluded that the protective effects of betaine against alcoholic liver injury may be attributed to the fortification of antioxidant defense via improvement of impaired sulfur amino acid metabolism.",

CYP2E1-generated ROS contributes to the ethanol-induced oxidant stress and inhibition of CYP2E1 activity decreases ethanol-induced fatty liver. The transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the expression of many cytoprotective enzymes which results in cellular protection against a variety of toxins.\n\nMethod\nThe current study was designed to evaluate the ability of sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, to blunt CYP2E1-dependent, ethanol-induced steatosis in vivo and in vitro.\n\nResults\nThe sulforaphane treatment activated Nrf2, increased levels of the Nrf2 target heme oxygenase -1 and subsequently lowered oxidant stress as shown by the decline in lipid peroxidation and 3-Nitrotyrosine protein adducts and an increase in GSH levels after the acute ethanol treatment. It decreased ethanol-elevated liver levels of triglycerides and cholesterol and Oil Red O staining. Similar results were found in vitro as addition of sulforaphane to HepG2 E47 cells, which express CYP2E1, elevated Nrf2 levels and decreased the accumulation of lipid in cells cultured with ethanol. Sulforaphane treatment had no effect on levels of or activity of CYP2E1.\n\nConclusions\nSulforaphane proved to be an effective in vivo inhibitor of acute ethanol–induced fatty liver in mice.\n\nGeneral significance\nThe possible amelioration of liver injury which occurs under these conditions by chemical activators of Nrf2 is of clinical relevance and worthy of further study.",

The aims of this study were to explore the mechanisms mediating the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic actions of betaine in fructose-fed rats. In this study, betaine improved insulin resistance, reduced body weight gain and serum lipid levels, and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation in fructose-fed rats. It up-regulated hepatic expression of liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), with the attenuation of the changes of their target genes, including hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1α, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1, apolipoprotein B, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and adipocyte differentiation-related protein, involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipid storage in these model rats. Furthermore, betaine alleviated ER stress and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, CPT II, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase expression involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Betaine suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis in fructose-fed rats by moderating protein kinase B -forkhead box protein O1 pathway, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Moreover, betaine inhibited hepatic nuclear factor kappa B /nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome activation-mediated inflammation in this animal model. These results demonstrated that betaine ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation, gluconeogenesis, and inflammation through restoring LXRα and PPARα expression and alleviating ER stress in fructose-fed rats. This study provides the potential mechanisms of betaine involved in the treatment of NAFLD.",

		"abstract": "We previously showed that theanine, is a major amino acid in green tea, enhanced doxorubicin (DOX) induced antitumor activity. Besides, theanine induced the elevation of glutathione (GSH) level attributable to the increase of glutamate in the liver of mice, namely theanine would reduce the adverse reaction of DOX. Consequently, theanine was thought to be effective against the tissue changes with GSH level reduction. On the other hand, it is suggested excessive uptake of alcohol causes a production of free radicals, a decrease of GSH level, and an increase in the amount of lipid peroxide (LPO) in liver, and shifting to an alcoholic liver injury. Then, aiming at the prevention and medical treatment of a hepatic toxicity by the food components with little toxicity, we have studied the effect of theanine (i.p.) on ethanol metabolism and hepatic toxicity using ethanol (p.o.) single-administered mice. On the 1st hour after ethanol administration, the ethanol concentrations in blood of the theanine combined groups decreased compared with the ethanol-alone group. The alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities in the liver increased by combined theanine. Since the elevation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 activity was controlled in the theanine-combined groups, it was considered that these disorders attributable to CYP2E1 in ethanol long-term uptake might be avoidable by theanine. Although LPO increased in 3 h after by single-administration of ethanol, the increase was controlled by theanine-administration and was improved until the normal level. In conclusion, it was indicated that theanine was effective against alcoholic liver injury.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol (ethanol) was administered chronically to female Sprague–Dawley rats in a nutritionally adequate, totally liquid diet for 28 days. This resulted in significant hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation. When taurine was administered for 2 days following alcohol withdrawal it was found to reduce alcohol-induced lipid peroxidation and completely reversed hepatic steatosis. The reversal of hepatic steatosis was demonstrated both biochemically and histologically. Two days following alcohol withdrawal, the apparent activity of the alcohol-inducible form of cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) was unchanged although total cytochrome P450 content was increased. In addition, alcohol significantly inhibited hepatic methionine synthase activity and increased homocysteine excretion in urine. Although alcohol did not affect the urinary excretion of taurine (a non-invasive marker of liver damage), levels of serum and hepatic taurine were markedly raised in animals given taurine following their treatment with alcohol, compared to animals given taurine alone. There was evidence of slight bile duct injury in animals treated with alcohol and with alcohol followed by taurine, as indicated by raised serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholesterol. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also slightly raised. The effects of taurine on reversing hepatic steatosis may be due to the enhanced secretion of hepatic triglycerides. It is suggested that increased bile flow as a result of taurine treatment may have contributed to the removal of lipid peroxides. These in-vivo findings demonstrate for the first time that hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation, occurring as a result of chronic alcohol consumption, can be reversed by administration of taurine to rats for 2 days.",

Hypotaurine and taurine were found to reside within the cytosolic compartment of the cell. The ratio of taurine to hypotaurine is approx 50:1. The cytosolic concentration of taurine is approx. 50 mM. The concentration of hypotaurine decreased by 80% when resting neutrophils were converted into actively respiring cells by exposure to opsonized zymosan. These results prompted in vitro studies on the antioxidant properties of hypotaurine. We demonstrate by EPR spectroscopy that hypotaurine competes with 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) (DMPO) for hydroxyl radicals, and that it is the sulfinyl group which confers hydroxyl radical scavenging activity to it. Following its exposure to hydroxyl radicals, two oxidation products were isolated by HPLC, one of which has been identified as taurine. The biological roles of hypotaurine and taurine in the neutrophil are discussed with respect to their antioxidant properties and subcellular location within the cell.",

		"abstract": "Lipoic acid (thiotic acid) is being used as a dietary supplement, and as a therapeutic agent, and is reported to have beneficial effects in disorders associated with oxidative stress, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. We present evidence that lipoic acid induces a substantial increase in cellular reduced glutathione in cultured human Jurkat T cells, human erythrocytes, C6 glial cells, NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The effect depends on metabolic reduction of lipoic acid to dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid is released into the culture medium where it reduces cystine. Cysteine thus formed is readily taken up by the neutral amino acid transport system and utilized for glutathione synthesis. By this mechanism lipoic acid enables cystine to bypass the χ-c transport system, which is weakly expressed in lymphocytes and inhibited by glutamate. Thereby lipoic acid enables the key enzyme of glutathione synthesis, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which is regulated by uptake-limited cysteine supply, to work at optimum conditions. Flow cytometric analysis of freshly prepared human peripheral blood lymphocytes, using monobromobimane labeling of cellular thiols, reveals that lipoic acid acts mainly to normalize a subpopulation of cells severely compromised in thiol status rather than to increase thiol content beyond physiological levels. Hence lipoic acid may have clinical relevance in restoration of severely glutathione deficient cells.",

In this work, we hypothesized that oxidative stress is a factor that triggers mitochondrial biogenesis after chronic EtOH feeding. If our hypothesis is correct, co-administration of antioxidants should prevent up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes.\n\n\nMethods\n\nRats were fed an EtOH-containing diet intragastrically by total enteral nutrition for 150 days, in the absence or presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 1.7 g/kg/d; control rats were administered isocaloric diets where carbohydrates substituted for EtOH calories.\n\n\nResults\n\nEtOH administration significantly increased hepatic oxidative stress, evidenced as decreased liver total glutathione and reduced glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio. These effects were inhibited by co-administration of EtOH and NAC. Chronic EtOH increased the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator-1 alpha and mitochondrial transcription factor A, and mitochondrial DNA; co-administration of EtOH and NAC prevented these effects. Chronic EtOH administration was associated with decreased mitochondrial mass, inactivation and depletion of mitochondrial complex I and complex IV, and increased hepatic mitochondrial oxidative damage, effects that were not prevented by NAC.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThese results suggest that oxidative stress caused by chronic EtOH triggered the up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in rat liver, because an antioxidant such as NAC prevented both effects. Because NAC did not prevent liver mitochondrial oxidative damage, extra-mitochondrial effects of reactive oxygen species may regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. In spite of the induction of hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis genes by chronic EtOH, mitochondrial mass and function decreased probably in association with mitochondrial oxidative damage. These results also predict that the effectiveness of NAC as an antioxidant therapy for chronic alcoholism will be limited by its limited antioxidant effects in mitochondria, and its inhibitory effect on mitochondrial biogenesis.",

This study reports the effect of TUDCA and UDCA on an in vitro model for ethanol-induced liver damage. Methods: Hep G2 cells were incubated for 24 hours with 80 mmol/L ethanol in the presence or absence of 50 μmol/L TUDCA or UDCA. Cells were also pretreated with 80 mmol/L EtOH and then exposed to 50 μmol/L bile acids. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the metabolism of formazan (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and sodium 3,3′-(phenylamino) carbonyl-3,4-tetrazolium-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrase and by the release into the culture medium of different enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, γ-glutamyl transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results: The incubation of Hep G2 with EtOH significantly (P < 0.001) increased cytotoxicity. Both TUDCA or UDCA reduced cytoxicity to a similar extent (P < 0.001). Cells pretreated with EtOH and then added with TUDCA or UDCA responded differently because TUDCA was significantly more effective (P < 0.05) than an equimolar dose of UDCA in reversing the damage. Electron microscopic examination revealed that TUDCA and UDCA were both able to prevent mitochondrial damage and to reduce steatosis induced by EtOH. Conclusions: Low doses of TUDCA and UDCA protect Hep G2 cells from EtOH-induced cytotoxicity. However, TUDCA seems to be more effective than UDCA in reversing the damage.",

		"abstract": "In hepatocytes ethanol (EtOH) is metabolized to acetaldehyde and to acetate. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) are said to protect the liver against alcohol. We investigated the influence of ethanol and acetaldehyde on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-containing human hepatoma cells (SK-Hep-1) and the protective effects of UDCA and TUDCA (0.01 and 0.1 mM). Cells were incubated with 100 and 200 mM ethanol, concentrations in a heavy drinker, or acetaldehyde. Treatment with acetaldehyde or ethanol resulted in a decrease of metabolic activity and viability of hepatocytes and an increase of cell membrane permeability. During simultaneous incubation with bile acids, the metabolic activity was better preserved by UDCA than by TUDCA. Due to its more polar character, acetaldehyde mostly damaged the superficial, more polar domain of the membrane. TUDCA reduced this effect, UDCA was less effective. Damage caused by ethanol was smaller and predominantly at the more apolar site of the cell membrane. In contrast, preincubation with TUDCA or UDCA strongly decreased metabolic activity and cell viability and led to an appreciable increase of membrane permeability. TUDCA and UDCA only in rather high concentrations reduce ethanol and acetaldehyde-induced toxicity in a different way, when incubated simultaneously with hepatocytes. In contrast, preincubation with bile acids intensified cell damage. Therefore, the protective effect of UDCA or TUDCA in alcohol- or acetaldehyde-treated SK-Hep-1 cells remains dubious.",

Previous data indicate that the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is essential for ethanol-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which ethanol induces the MPT remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, in acute ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. We found that Bax translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria before mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Bax translocation was oxidative stress dependent. Mitochondrial Bax formed a protein complex with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Prevention of Bax-VDAC interactions by a microinjection of anti-VDAC antibody effectively prevented hepatocyte apoptosis by ethanol. In conclusion, these data suggest that Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria leads to the subsequent formation of a Bax-VDAC complex that plays a crucial role in acute ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The precise pathogenic significance of oxidative injury in the evolution of alcohol-induced liver disease is still obscure. The present report was designed to investigate whether ethanol alters the production of active oxidants and biological activities of hepatocytes. METHODS: The following parameters in rat hepatocytes were investigated by using fluorescence probes in vitro and ex vivo: (1) mitochondrial membrane potential and membrane permeability transition, (2) oxygen radicals generation, (3) membrane barrier function, and (4) glutathione level. RESULTS: Ethanol (50 mmol/L) increased oxidative stress in hepatocytes and subsequently induced an increased mitochondrial permeability transition and a decreased membrane potential. These ethanol-induced alterations were attenuated by an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and an intracellular oxidant scavenger, whereas they were enhanced by diethyl maleic acid, a glutathione depletor. Ethanol plus diethyl maleic acid but not ethanol alone increased the number of hepatocytes with membrane barrier dysfunction. A continuous infusion of ethanol (50 mmol/L) increased oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in the pericentral area of isolated perfused rat liver. CONCLUSIONS: Active oxidants generated during ethanol metabolism increase mitochondrial permeability transition and modulate mitochondrial energy synthesis in hepatocytes. Reduction of glutathione level enhances mitochondrial dysfunction and impairs membrane barrier function of hepatocytes. (Gastroenterology 1997 Apr;112(4):1331-43)",

The experimental animals (male Wistar rats) were divided into 5 rats/group and were fed the following diets for 1 month: corn oil and ethanol (CO+E) or corn oil and dextrose (CO+D), and fish oil and ethanol (FO+E) or fish oil and dextrose (FO+D). For each animal, microsomal analysis of CYP 2E1 protein, aniline hydroxylase activity, fatty acid composition, and conjugated dienes was conducted. Also, evaluation of severity of pathology was done for each rat. The mean ± SD of the pathology score was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the FO+E (6.0 ± 1.3) group than in the CO+E group (3.0 ± 0.5). No pathological changes were evident in the dextrose-fed controls. The CYP 2E1 protein levels (mean ± SD) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the FO+E group (13.1 ± 2.0) compared with the CO+E (4.7 ± 1.2) and FO+D (1.8 ± 0.5) groups. Higher levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosa-hexaenoic acids and lower levels of arachidonic acid were detected in liver microsomes from rats fed fish oil compared with corn oil. A significant correlation was obtained between CYP 2E1 protein and conjugated diene levels (r= 0.78, p < 0.01). Our results showing markedly increased CYP 2E1 induction and lipid peroxidation in the FO+E group provides one possible explanation for the greater severity of liver injury in this group.",

		"abstract": "1. The monooxygenase and oxidase activities of liver microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)-treated rabbits were investigated for their dependence on the high spin shift (Δα) of the ferric cytochrome P-450 induced by a series of benzphetamine analogues.2. The spin shift activity of the substrate determines, via the first electron transfer kinetics, the steady-state level of the reaction intermediate oxycytochrome P-450. Correlation of the amount or oxycytochrome P-450 with Δα can be experimentally proved.3. The spin-state-dependent formation of oxycytochrome P-450 regulates quantitatively the rates of NADPH oxidation and substrate N-demethylation. Both activities correlate with Δα. Oxycytochrome P-450 is substrate-stabilized towards decay with the formation of O2− which, upon dismutation, gives rise to H2O2.4. The ratio of N-demethylase to NADPH oxidase activity (coupling ratio) also increases with the spin shift, Δα. Concomitantly, the proportion of NADPH accounted for by H2O2 and H2O formation via two- and four-electron reduction of dioxygen decreases. This indicates that the substrate-induced structural changes in the enzyme active centre which give rise to spin transition may likewise modify the coupling properties.5. Perfluorinated compounds, which fail to undergo monooxygenation, fall in line with the benzphetamine derivatives with respect to the dependence of NADPH oxidation rate and steady-state oxycytochrome P-450 level on Δα. The increased oxidase activity results mostly in H2O formation.6. The leakiness of the PB-induccd monooxygenase pathway in the biotransformation of oxygen in the presence of the benzphetamines and perfluorinated compounds does not result in marked increases in H2O2 formation. Therefore, the increase of NADPH oxidase activity by these substrates does not significantly enhance H2O2-mediated oxygen tissue toxicity.",

We always associate the liver as the major organ responsible for detoxification of the body; however this process occurs in many tissues. In the same way, as in the liver, the brain expresses metabolic pathways associated with the elimination of xenobiotics. Besides the detoxifying role of CYP2E1 for compounds such as electrophilic agents, reactive oxygen species, free radical products, and the bioactivation of xenobiotics, CYP2E1 is also related in several diseases and pathophysiological conditions. In this review, we describe the presence of phase I monooxygenase CYP2E1 in regions of the brain. We also explore the conditions where protein, mRNA, and the activity of CYP2E1 are induced. Finally, we describe the relation of CYP2E1 in brain disorders, including the behavioral relations for alcohol consumption via CYP2E1 metabolism.",

		"abstract": "Controversy exists as to whether the induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol occurs via increased protein synthesis or protein stabilization. To address these issues in vivo, we chronically administered ethanol to rats and determined levels of immunoreactive CYP2E1 in liver, kidney, brain and upper gastro-intestinal tract (GI). Our data shows that chronic ethanol administration induces hepatic (5-6-foId over pair-fed controls) and extra-hepatic CYP2E1, an effect which is strikingly absent 12 hours after ethanol withdrawal. No changes in CYP2E1 mRNA were observed at any time, suggesting these changes are mainly post-translational at a blood ethanol concentration of 0.15% w/v. Our experimental data indicates that CYP2E1 possesses a half-life of 6 hours or less in the liver and is rapidly degraded following the removal of ethanol. This pattern of CYP2E1 turnover was also observed in other tissues, suggestive of a similar mode of regulation.",

		"abstract": "The hepatic microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) has been well characterized as an important pathway in ethanol metabolism. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1), the principal components of MEOS, is ethanol inducible and has been implicated in hepatotoxicity associated with alcohol abuse and exposure to organic solvents. Results of chronic in vivo experiments have shown that ethanol induction of hepatic CYP 2E1 occurs by a two-step mechanism. The first step of induction is associated with low blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and appears to be post-transcriptional, whereas high BACs observed in step-two induction are associated with increased CYP 2E1 gene transcription. The mechanisms underlying these induction steps under intense investigation. Progress in this area has been limited due to lack of hepatic cell culture models that express CYP 2E1. We report here an in vitro tissue culture cell model, the FGC-4 hepatoma cell line, that exhibits basal levels of CYP 2E1 apoprotein that are inducible by ethanol treatment. Total cellular RNA and microsomal fraction were isolated from control or ethanol-treated confluent cells, and CYP 2E1 mRNA and apoprotein levels were characterized by northern blot or immunoblot analysis, respectively. Initial experiments on isolated microsomes revealed detectable levels of CYP 2E1 apoprotein in control cells that were induced 5-fold in cells treated with 100mmM ethanol for 24hr. Concentration-response experiments demonstrated that the maximal 24-hr induction in CYP 2E1 apoprotein level was 5-fold and was attained at a concentration of 10 mM ethanol. Interestingly, while the steady-state mRNA levels encoding CYP 2E1 were detectable, they remained unchanged in identically treated cells. Furthermore, there was no observed increase in CYP 2E1 mRNA levels in an extended time course to 72 hr or at higher alcohol concentrations (up to 1500 mM), providing preliminary evidence that the induction is post-transcriptional. The time course of CYP 2E1 apoprotein induction by exposure to 100 mM ethanol demonstrated maximal induction at 8 hr. Measurement of CYP 2E1 apoprotein levels after removal of ethanol from pretreated cells demonstrated the half-life of the apoprotein to be 12.7 hr, in good agreement with previous reports using primary hepatocytes. The half-life of the induced protein after ethanol removal in the presence of cyclohexamide (10 μg/mL) was biphasic with a rapid 1.8 hr first phase followed by a slower 44.7 hr second phase. However, if the pre-induced cells were allowed to remain in the presence of ethanol and cyclohexamide, the half-life was monophasic, consisting of only the slow phase. These data provide preliminary evidence that the mechanism of stabilization of the ethanol-induced CYP 2E1 apoprotein is post-translational. Combined, these experiments demonstrate that the FGC-4 hepatoma cell line expresses CYP 2E1 and that the apoprotein is inducible by ethanol by post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

		"abstract": "Background:  Chronic alcohol consumption is known to induce cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) leading to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatotoxicity. We showed that replacement of dietary long-chain triglycerides (LCT) by medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) could be protective. We now wondered whether the induction of mitochondrial CYP2E1 plays a role and whether liver injury could be avoided through mitochondrial intervention. Methods:  Rats were fed 4 different isocaloric liquid diets. The control group received our standard dextrin-maltose diet with intake limited to the average consumption of the 3 alcohol groups fed ad libitum the alcohol containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. The fat was either 32% of calories as LCT (alcohol), or 16% as LCT + 16% as MCT (alcohol-MCT 16%), or 32% as MCT only (alcohol-MCT 32%). Results:  After 21 days, compared to the controls, the alcohol and both alcohol-MCT groups had a significant increase in mitochondrial CYP2E1 (p < 0.05 for both). As shown before, the same was found for the microsomal CYP2E1. When MCT replaced all the fat, like in the alcohol-MCT 32% group, CYP2E1 was significantly reduced by 40% in mitochondria (p < 0.05) and 30% in microsomes (p < 0.01). In mitochondria, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a parameter of oxidative stress, paralleled CYP2E1. Compared to controls, alcohol and alcohol-MCT 16% significantly raised mitochondrial 4-HNE (p < 0.001), whereas the alcohol-MCT 32% diet brought it down to control levels (p < 0.001). Mitochondrial reduced glutathione (GSH) was also significantly lowered by alcohol consumption (p < 0.05), and it increased to almost normal levels with alcohol-MCT 32% (p = 0.006). These changes in the mitochondria reflected the reduction observed in total liver in which alcohol-MCT 32% decreased the alcohol-induced steatosis with a diminution of triglycerides (p < 0.001) and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (p < 0.001). Conclusion:  Mitochondria participate in the induction of CYP2E1 by alcohol and contribute to lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion. Thus, lipid composition of the diet is an important determinant for the beneficial effect of MCT, with a diet containing a mixture of LCT/MCT being ineffective.",

		"abstract": "Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1, the alcohol-inducible form of CYP, metabolizes a wide variety of endogenous substrates, therapeutic agents, protoxicants, and procarcinogens. CYP2E1 levels are post-transcriptionally elevated in response to certain xenobiotic inducers (e.g., pyridine), and proposed mechanisms include increased translational efficiency and protection of the enzyme from ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Molecular modeling of a predicted cytosolic domain of CYP2E1 resulted in identification of a putative ubiquitination-target/substrate-interaction structure (residues 317–340). An affinity-purified antibody reactive to this domain quenched CYP2E1 ubiquitination in a concentration-dependent manner in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based ubiquitination assay. The same antibody also inhibited rat liver microsomal chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP2E1 catalytic activity, in an equivalent concentration-dependent manner. These two observations suggest an association between the CYP2E1 cytosolic domain involved in catalysis and its serving as a target for ubiquitination. Thus, these results provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for the observation that substrate binding shields the CYP2E1 protein from turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent machinery.",

A steady-state pulse-chase analysis was used to determine a half-life of 3.8 h for CYP2E1 while the half-life of CYP2B1 was 2.3-fold greater in the same cell line. In contrast, NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase which is constitutively expressed in Tc-HeLa cells had a half-life of about 30 h. Lactacystin and other selective proteasome inhibitors including N-benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (MG132) and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norvalinal (MG115) significantly inhibited both CYP2E1 and CYP2B1 degradation. The turnover of CYP2E1 was slightly inhibited by calpain inhibitors while CYP2B1 turnover was not altered. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis had no effect on the degradation of either protein. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A did not alter the degradation of either P450 which suggested the degradation occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates were not observed. Mutagenesis of two putative ubiquitination sites (Lys 317 and 324) did not alter the degradation of CYP2E1. The role of ubiquitination in the degradation of CYP2E1 was also examined in a Chinese hamster mutant cell line E36ts20 that contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). The turnover of CYP2E1 was not significantly different at the nonpermissive temperature in the ts20 when compared to the control E36 cells. Furthermore, the addition of the hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin, herbimycin, and radicicol had no effect on the turnover of CYP2E1, differentiating the degradation of CYP2E1 from other substrates for proteasome-dependent degradation.",

SAM (but not SAH, MTA or methionine) produced a type II binding spectrum with liver microsomal cytochrome P450 from rats treated with acetone or isoniazid to induce CYP2E1. Binding was less effective for control microsomes. SAM did not alter the carbon monoxide binding spectrum of P450, nor denature P450 to P420, nor inhibit the activity of NADPH-P450 reductase. However, SAM inhibited the catalytic activity of CYP2E1 with typical substrates such as p-nitrophenol, ethanol, and dimethylnitrosamine, with an IC50 around 1.5–5mM. SAM was a non-competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1 catalytic activity and its inhibitory actions could not be mimicked by methionine, SAH or MTA. However, SAM did not inhibit the oxidation of ethanol to α-hydroxyethyl radical, an assay for hydroxyl radical generation. In microsomes engineered to express individual human P450s, SAM produced a type II binding spectrum with CYP2E1-, but not with CYP3A4-expressing microsomes, and SAM was a weaker inhibitor against the metabolism of a specific CYP3A4 substrate than a specific CYP2E1 substrate. SAM also inhibited CYP2E1 catalytic activity in intact HepG2 cells engineered to express CYP2E1. These results suggest that SAM interacts with cytochrome P450s, especially CYP2E1, and inhibits the catalytic activity of CYP2E1 in a reversible and non competitive manner. However, SAM is a weak inhibitor of CYP2E1. Since the Ki for SAM inhibition of CYP2E1 activity is relatively high, inhibition of CYP2E1 activity is not likely to play a major role in the ability of SAM to protect against the hepatotoxicity produced by toxins requiring metabolic activation by CYP2E1 such as acetaminophen, ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, thioacetamide and carcinogens.",

		"abstract": "This study describes the effects of chronic ethanol (ETOH) treatment and withdrawal on the rat hepatic mixed-function mono-oxygenase system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g, 10 per group) were administered ETOH as part of the Lieber-deCarli liquid diet for 3 weeks. Ethanol was removed, and the animals were euthanized at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hr post-withdrawal. Microsomes were prepared, and ethanol-inducible cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) activity was measured using the enzyme markers N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMAd), p-nitrophenol hydroxylase (PNPH) and aniline hydroxylase (AH). Activities were found to be induced significantly after chronic ETOH feeding using all three assays (NDMAd, 5-fold; PNPH, 3.5-fold; AH, 9-fold). Upon ETOH withdrawal, all three activities dropped markedly, with NDMAd and PNPH at control values at 24 hr and all subsequent time points. AH activity remained 3-fold higher than controls at 24, 48 and 72 hr. Western blot analyses showed that immunoreactive CYP2E1 returned to control at 24 hr, consonant with NDMAd and PNPH activities. The prolonged induction of AH activity following ETOH withdrawal indicates that it is not a specific marker of CYP2E1-catalyzed reactions. Collectively, these data are suggestive of a rapid mechanism of CYP2E1 degradation in the rat liver. Of the other parameters investigated in this study, total cytochrome P450 content was increased 2.5-fold after ETOH feeding, with levels dropping markedly 24 hr post-withdrawal. NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity was unchanged throughout the course of the study. CYP1A1, CYP2B1 and CYP3A activities were assessed by the substrate probes ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD), pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) and erythromycin N-demethylase (ERNd). EROD and PROD were induced significantly by ETOH administration (2-fold) at 0 hr, with EROD remaining elevated over controls 24 hr post-withdrawal. Quantitative western blot analysis of CYP1A1 and CYP2B1 revealed a pattern of immunostaining generally consistent with but less variable than levels predicted by the respective substrate markers. Both proteins were induced significantly by chronic ethanol administration (CYP1A1, 1.9-fold; CYP2B1, 4-fold). Induction of these P450 isoforms persisted for several days following withdrawal. In contrast, immunoreactive CYP1A2 was found to decrease significantly (by 30–40%) during ethanol withdrawal (24, 48, 72, 168 hr). ERNd activity was induced significantly by chronic ETOH feeding (2.5-fold) and remained so for 24 hr into the withdrawal period (2-fold). Immunoreactive CYP3A1 was also induced significantly following ETOH administration (0 hr) and 24 hr following withdrawal. Collectively, the data presented suggest that chronic ethanol feeding induces in vivo at least four distinct P450 isoforms: CYP2E1, CYP1A1, CYP2B1 and CYP3A1. Ethanol withdrawal resulted in a 30–40% loss of CYP1A2. CYP1A1, CYP2B1 and CYP3A1 were elevated during ethanol withdrawal, unlike CYP2E1, a protein that undergoes rapid degradation following the removal of ethanol. Such findings are consistent with several distinct mechanisms of P450 isoform induction/ degradation by ethanol.",

		"abstract": "Increased levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) produced by low-molecular-weight compounds is mostly due to stabilization of the enzyme against proteolytic degradation. CYP2E1, in the absence of substrate or ligand, normally has a short half-life, but the factors which regulate CYP2E1 turnover or trigger its rapid degradation are not known. Since CYP2E1 is active in producing reactive oxygen species, experiments were carried out to evaluate whether reactive oxygen species modulated the degradation of CYP2E1. CYP2E1 present in human liver microsomes was very stable. Addition of the cytosol fraction produced degradation of CYP2E1, and this was enhanced when NADPH was present in the reaction system. Antioxidants or iron chelators which prevent lipid peroxidation, prevented the degradation of CYP2E1 by the cytosolic fraction. Similarly, diphenyleneiodonium chloride, which inhibits NADPH-dependent electron transfer, prevented the degradation of CYP2E1, as did 4-methylpyrazole, a ligand which increases the level of CYP2E1. If microsomes were first incubated with NADPH for 30 min, followed by the addition of these agents, there was no protection against CYP2E1 degradation. Lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome, decreased the degradation of CYP2E1. In intact HepG2 cells transduced to express CYP2E1, proteasome inhibitors elevated steady-state levels of CYP2E1. Steady-state levels of CYP2E1 were increased by about 50% when the cells were incubated with trolox. Trolox decreased the rate of loss of CYP2E1 protein when the cells were treated with cycloheximide. These results suggest that NADPH-dependent production of reactive oxygen species may result in oxidative modification of CYP2E1, followed by rapid degradation of the labilized CYP2E1 by the proteasome complex. It is interesting to speculate that one consequence of the high rates of production of reactive oxygen species by CYP2E1 is its own labilization and subsequent rapid degradation, and this may be a regulatory mechanism to prevent high levels of the enzyme from accumulating within the cell.",

		"abstract": "One major mode of regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is at the posttranscriptional level, since many low-molecular-weight compounds stabilize the enzyme against proteolysis by the proteasome complex. In an in vitro system containing human liver microsomes, degradation of CYP2E1 in the microsomes required addition of the human liver cytosol fraction in a reaction sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome complex. It is not clear how CYP2E1 in the microsomal membrane becomes accessible to the cytosolic proteasome. Since molecular chaperones play a role in protein folding and degradation, the possible role of heat shock proteins in CYP2E1 degradation by this reconstituted system was evaluated. Degradation of CYP2E1 required ATP; ATP-γS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, did not catalyze CYP2E1 degradation by the cytosol fraction, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required. Geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of hsp90, inhibited the degradation of microsomal CYP2E1 by the cytosol fraction. Control experiments indicated that geldanamycin was not a substrate/ligand of CYP2E1 nor did it prevent microsomal lipid peroxidation, a process which increases CYP2E1 turnover. Inhibition by geldanamycin was prevented by molybdate. Both of these compounds have been shown to promote alterations in hsp90 structure and to modulate hsp90–protein interactions. The proteasome activity in the cytosol, as assayed by the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide, was enhanced when ATP was added and inhibited by 30–40% by geldanamycin, effects that are similar, although less pronounced, to the degradation of CYP2E1 by the cytosol. Purified 20S proteasome could catalyze degradation of CYP2E1; however, in an assay using equal peptidase activity, the cytosol fraction was much more effective than the 20S proteasome in promoting CYP2E1 degradation. Immunodepletion of hsp90 from the cytosol resulted in prevention of the degradation of CYP2E1, a reaction that was reversed by the addition of pure hsp90 to this cytosol. These results suggest that in addition to the proteasome, the cytosol fraction contains other factors that modulate the efficiency of CYP2E1 degradation. The sensitivity to geldanamycin and molybdate and the immunodepletion experiments suggest that hsp90 is one of these factors that interact with CYP2E1 and/or with the proteasome to promote the degradation of this microsomal P450.",

		"abstract": "Free radical products have previously been detected in rodents after chronic feeding with an ethanol-containing, high-fat diet. The significance of reactive free radical formation in ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity has been difficult to assess because most rodent models exhibit only fatty liver. However, serious hepatic damage resembling clinical alcoholic liver injury (e.g., steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis) occurs in rats after continuous intragastric administration of an ethanol-containing, high-fat diet developed by Tsukamoto and French. Accordingly, rats treated with ethanol for at least 2 weeks using this protocol were administered the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone, and bile samples were collected. A six-line radical adduct spectrum was detected in the bile of ethanol-treated rats. A similar spectrum of lower intensity was detected with rats fed a high-fat diet without ethanol, but little or no radical adduct signal was detected with chow-fed animals. For both treatment groups, alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone and extra ethanol were given acutely. Destruction of Kupffer cells by chronic treatment with GdCl3 decreased by about 50% the radical adduct formation in rats fed the ethanol-containing, high-fat diet. This radical species was largely ethanol derived, because addition of [13C]ethanol produced a 12-line spectrum, indicating the formation of alpha-hydroxyethyl radical. Ethanol treatment also caused hypoxia (detected on the liver surface in vivo with oxygen electrodes), which was reflected in a dose-dependent decrease in oxygen tension with ethanol. The effect was blocked by GdCl3. Hepatic damage detected by histology was prevalent in ethanol-treated rats but only mild fatty liver was observed in high-fat diet-fed controls. GdCl3 treatment eliminated hepatic damage due to high-fat and ethanol diets, and when all groups were compared a significant correlation between liver injury and radical adduct signal was observed. Thus, free radical formation in ethanol-treated rats has been detected for the first time in a model that exhibits injury characteristic of human alcoholic injury, and signal intensity correlates with hepatotoxicity. Moreover, the decrease in both free radical formation and hepatic damage produced by GdCl3 implicates Kupffer cells in the development of alcoholic liver injury. This important pathophysiological process may involve direct production of reactive oxygen species or indirect actions of mediators on parenchymal cells.",

		"abstract": "Hepatic CYP2E1 is induced in several models of alcohol administration, but clinically relevant pathology is only observed in rats in a model involving the continuous intragastric administration of an ethanol-containing, corn oil-based, high-fat diet. The level of CYP2E1 correlates with the degree of liver pathology in the intragastric feeding model, which leads to the hypothesis that radical production by CYP2E1 is responsible for the pathology. Destruction of the Kupffer cells with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) prevented the development of ethanol-dependent pathology and decreased the production of radicals that appeared in the bile of intragastrically alcohol-fed rats. If the induction of CYP2E1 and subsequent formation of oxidant species by the enzyme is causative in the ethanol-dependent hepatic pathology, then protection by GdCl3 could be due an inhibition of CYP2E1 induction. In the current study, ethanol-administration for 4 wk produced marked steatosis, necrosis, and inflammation not seen in control rats. Immunochemically, CYP2E1 was induced 5- to 6-fold in microsomes from the ethanol-treated animals. Rates of p-nitrophenol and chlorzoxazone hydroxylation were elevated approximately 3-fold, consistent with CYP2E1 induction. When GdCl3 was administered with ethanol, there was a decrease of approximately 80% in Kupffer cell receptor expression, and there was a significant decrease in hepatic pathology, which confirms previous studies. However, in the ethanol and GdCl3-treated animals, there was no significant decrease in the induction of CYP2E1. CYP2E1 was elevated approximately 5-fold, as estimated by immunoblot analysis, and rates of p-nitrophenol and chlorzoxazone hydroxylation were elevated 3- to 4-fold in ethanol + GdCl3-treated rats. Thus, these results clearly dissociate the induction of CYP2E1 by intragastric infusion of ethanol from the generation of early alcohol-induced liver disease. It is concluded that Kupffer cells rather than CYP2E1 play the major role in the initiation of hepatocyte damage caused by alcohol.",

Here, its effect on alcohol-induced liver injury in an enteral alcohol feeding model was investigated. Male Wistar rats were given control high-fat or ethanol containing diets enterally for 4 weeks. Treated rats received 500 mg/kg/d of dietary OTC. Ethanol delivery, weight gain, and the cyclic pattern of ethanol in the urine were not different between the OTC-ethanol and ethanol groups. After 4 weeks, serum aspartate transaminase (AST), necrosis and inflammation were elevated significantly by ethanol compared with appropriate high-fat controls, effects blocked by OTC. Moreover, ethanol elevated hepatic tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) messenger RNA (mRNA) and the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) 2-3 fold. NFκB in isolated Kupffer cells was also increased by ethanol. These effects were all blocked by OTC treatment. Additionally, superoxide production was higher in Kupffer cells isolated from ethanol-treated rats, an effect blunted by OTC. OTC also increased circulating glutathione (GSH) levels about 2-fold; however, GSH levels were not affected by ethanol or OTC in livers from the groups studied. Surprisingly, GSH was elevated by ethanol and OTC treatment in isolated Kupffer cells about 2-fold. Moreover, GSH (Ki-10 μmol/L) and cysteinyl-glycine, but not oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or OTC, blunted the LPS-induced increase in calcium in isolated Kupffer cells, possibly by activating a glycine-gated chloride channel due to their structural similarity with glycine. Collectively, it is concluded that GSH is protective, in part, by increasing circulating GSH, which blunts activation of Kupffer cells via the glycine-gated chloride channel.",

NADPH oxidase (mainly in liver Kupffer cells and infiltrating neutrophils) could be a potential free radical source. We aimed to determine if NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium sulfate (DPI) affects nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, liver tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression, and early alcohol-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed high-fat liquid diets with or without ethanol (10–16 g · kg−1 · day−1) continuously for up to 4 wk, using the Tsukamoto-French intragastric enteral feeding protocol. DPI or saline vehicle was administered by subcutaneous injection for 4 wk. Mean urine ethanol concentrations were similar between the ethanol- and ethanol plus DPI-treated groups. Enteral ethanol feeding caused severe fat accumulation, mild inflammation, and necrosis in the liver (pathology score, 4.3 ± 0.3). In contrast, DPI significantly blunted these changes (pathology score, 0.8 ± 0.4). Enteral ethanol administration for 4 wk also significantly increased free radical adduct formation, NF-κB activity, and TNF-α expression in the liver. DPI almost completely blunted these parameters. These results indicate that DPI prevents early alcohol-induced liver injury, most likely by inhibiting free radical formation via NADPH oxidase, thereby preventing NF-κB activation and TNF-α mRNA expression in the liver.",

		"abstract": "In a previous study (Wu and Cederbaum, J. Biol. Chem. 271:23914-23919, 1996), ethanol was shown to be cytotoxic to HepG2 cells, which were transduced to express human cytochrome P-4502E1 (CYPPE1) but not to control HepG2 cells. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether this toxicity was apoptotic in nature. Incubation of CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells with 100 mM ethanol for 2 days produced morphological changes and DNA fragmentation (in situ labeling, flow cytometry, and DNA ladder formation) indicative of apoptosis. No changes were observed in the control HepG2 cells that do not express CYPPE1. Ethanol-induced apoptosis was also observed in HepG2 cells transiently transfected to express CYPPE1. The ethanol-induced apoptosis was prevented by 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of ethanol oxidation by CYPPE1, and by trolox, an anti-oxidant that prevents lipid peroxidation. Ethanol treatment of the cells expressing CYP2E1 resulted in increased activities of caspases 1 and 3. An inhibitor of these caspases prevented the ethanol-induced apoptosis in the stable cell lines and the transiently transfected cell lines. Ethanol did not cause apoptosis in a HepG2 cell line overexpressing bcl-2 plus CYPPE1, but did cause apoptosis in cell lines expressing CYPPE1 in the absence of bcl-2. These experiments demonstrate that ethanol can produce apoptosis in HepG2 cells that express CYPPE1. Increased production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation can be associated with apoptotic cell death. The prevention of the ethanol-induced apoptosis by 4-methylpyrazole and by trolox suggests that production of a prooxidative state as a consequence of ethanol oxidation by CYP2E1 results in eventual activation of caspases such as caspases 1 and 3, which can trigger the apoptotic process.",

		"abstract": "The effect of ethanol on the viability of a HepG2 cell model which was developed to constitutively express human CYP2E1 was studied in an attempt to establish a linkage between CYP2E1, reactive oxygen intermediates, and ethanol toxicity. Assays of toxicity included leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, trypan blue uptake, morphology, and formazan production. Ethanol was toxic to HepG2 E9 cells, which express CYP2E1, but not to HepG2 MV5 cells, which do not express CYP2E1. The ethanol toxicity was dependent on the concentration of ethanol, starting with 10 mM ethanol, and on the time of incubation with ethanol. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which increases the expression of CYP2E1 in this model, increased the toxicity by ethanol. Ethanol toxicity was prevented by 4-methylpyrazole and by diallyl sulfide, inhibitors of CYP2E1. The ethanol toxicity was also prevented by radical trapping agents such as N-acetylcysteine and N-t-butyl-α-phenylnitrone, antioxidative agents such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, thiourea, and uric acid, and inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, such as vitamin E phosphate, Trolox, and diphenylphenylenediamine. Besides ethanol, other substrates such as Me2SO, CCl4, isoniazid, and N,N-dimethylnitrosamine were cytotoxic to cells expressing CYP2E1 but not to control cells. These results indicate that ethanol was toxic to HepG2 cells which express human CYP2E1 by a pathway sensitive to inhibitors of CYP2E1 and to a variety of antioxidative agents. This model appears to be useful in efforts to establish a CYP2E1-dependent ethanol hepatotoxicity system and to evaluate the role of oxidative stress and reactive radical species in the toxicity by ethanol.",

The presence of CYPs in these organelles raises questions regarding their metabolic role and their possible deleterious effects on the respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial DNA. This review will focus on one particular CYP, CYP2E1, which represents a significant source of reactive oxygen species and is involved in the metabolism of small molecule substrates including ethanol, drugs and carcinogens. Since hepatic CYP2E1 expression is increased in different physiopathological situations such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and ethanol intoxication, the presence of significant levels of this CYP within the mitochondria could have major deleterious effects. This review recalls the main data that brought to the fore the presence of CYP2E1 in mitochondria and the mechanism of its targeting in this organelle. The potential pathological consequences linked to the presence of CYP2E1 in mitochondria will be subsequently discussed.",

		"abstract": "The liver microsomal ethanol-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P-450IIE1) form is known to exhibit a high rate of oxidase activity in the absence of substrate and it was therefore of interest to evaluate whether this form of P-450 could contribute to microsomal and liposomal NADPH-dependent oxidase activity and lipid peroxidation. The rate of microsomal NADPH-consumption, O2--formation, H2O2-production and generation of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive substances correlated to the amount of P-450IIE1 in 28 microsomal samples from variously treated rats. Anti-P-450IIE1 IgG inhibited, compared to control IgG, microsomal H2O2-formation by 45% in microsomes from acetone-treated rats and by 22% in control microsomes. NADPH-dependent generation of TBA-reactive products was completely inhibited by these antibodies, whereas preimmune IgG was essentially without effect. Liposomes containing reductase and P-450IIE1 were peroxidized in a superoxide dismutase (SOD) sensitive reaction at a 5-10-fold higher rate than membranes containing 3 other forms of cytochrome P-450. Lipid peroxidation in reconstituted vesicles dependent on the presence of P-450IIB1 was by contrast not inhibited by SOD. Microsomal peroxidase activities, using 15-(S)-hydroperoxy-5-cis-8,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid as a substrate were high in microsomes from phenobarbital- or ethanol-treated rats but low in membranes from isoniazid-treated rats, having the highest relative level of P-450IIE1. It is suggested that the oxidase activity of P-450IIE1 contributes to microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation. The combined action of the oxidase activity by P-450IIE1 and the peroxidase activities by P-450IIB1 and other forms of P-450 may be important for the high rate of lipid peroxidation observed in e.g. microsomes from ethanol- or acetone-treated rats. The possible importance of cytochrome P-450IIE1-dependent lipid peroxidation in vivo after ethanol abuse is discussed.",

Our results show a slight decrease in liver cytochrome aa3 content, the mitochondrial alteration which is most consistently observed during chronic ethanol feeding. In liver and heart mitochondria, ethanol consumption led to an increase in state 3 respiration with NAD+-linked substrates, whereas no changes were apparent in respiration rates with succinate as substrate. However a decrease was found in state 3 respiration with succinate in brain mitochondria isolated from ethanol-fed rats. Submitochondrial particles (SMP) were used to study the superoxide radical (O2fx1827-1) production at the level of antimycin-inhibited regions of the respiratory chain. It appears that there is no clear correlation between ethanol effects on respiration and O2fx1827-2 production. Whereas O2fx1827-3 generation remained unchanged in heart mitochondria, an elevation of O2fx1827-4 generation was observed in brain mitochondria, and in contrast, the rate of O2fx1827-5 production was decreased in liver mitochondria of the ethanol-group in comparison to the control-group. Our findings support a tissue specificity for the toxic effects of ethanol towards the mitochondria and indicate that mitochondrial free radical mechanisms are involved in ethanol-induced toxicity in the brain.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one the most serious consequences of chronic alcohol abuse. Liver cirrhosis, the culmination of the illness, is one of the leading causes of death in Western countries. Mitochondria are a target of ethanol intoxication mainly due to the toxic effects of acetaldehyde, a byproduct of ethanol metabolism. Morphological and functional changes in mitochondria are one of the key hallmarks of chronic ethanol exposure in both chronic alcoholics and experimental models of alcoholism. The functional changes observed in mitochondria from ethanol-treated animals are translated in an overall decrease in ATP levels resulting from a lower rate of ATP synthesis as a consequence of impaired processing at the translational level of some components of oxidative phosphorylation encoded by mitochondrial DNA genome. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in the maintenance of cell functions and viability and in mitochondrial physiology by metabolism of oxygen free radicals generated in the respiratory chain. GSH in mitochondria originates from cytosol by a transport system which translocates GSH into the matrix. This transport system is impaired in chronic ethanol-fed rats, which translates in a selective and significant depletion of the mitochondrial GSH content resulting in the development of an increased susceptibility to oxidant stress. Using the intragastric infusion model of experimental ALD in rats, the profound and selective mitochondrial GSH depletion precedes the onset of alcoholic liver disease, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, and progression of liver damage. These results suggest that depletion of mitochondrial GSH by impairment of its transport from cytosol into mitochondria could be an additional contributing factor in the development of ALD by favoring pro-oxidant production and oxidant stress in mitochondria.",

Forty-two male rats were fed the following liquid diets for 8 weeks: Control; Control with DLPC (1.5 g/1000 Calories (Cal); Alcohol (36% of Cal); Alcohol with DLPC (1.5 g/1000 Cal) and Alcohol with PPC (3 g/1000 Cal). As expected, ethanol feeding diminished the capacity of hepatic mitochondria to oxidize glutamate and palmitoyl-1-carnitine, and also decreased the activity of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. These effects were equally prevented by either PPC or DLPC. In conclusion, DLPC fully reproduced PPC's protective action and may be effective in the prevention or delay of more severe liver damage.",

B. aristata stem bark extract was prepared and was characterised using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The antimicrobial efficacy of the extract against carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli was assessed in vivo in an animal model using Sprague Dawley rats. Microbial counts in blood and urine, physical health status, haematological and biochemical analysis of blood, and histopathology of the kidney were assessed as the study endpoints. An aquo-alcoholic extract of B. aristata (PTRC-2111-A) was found to effectively manage peritonitis induced by carbapenem-resistant E. coli in a rat model at a single post-exposure prophylactic dose of 0.5mg/kg body weight (BW). The extract was also found to show a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) up to a dose of 2000mg/kg BW. Physical, immunological, haematological, biochemical and histopathological aberrations were found to be restored to normal in the herbal-treated group at a dose of 0.5mg/kg BW. The antimicrobial and hepatorenal protective ability of PTRC-2111-A could be attributed to the presence of isoquinoline alkaloids.",

		"abstract": "Chronic ethanol consumption decreases the synthesis of all 13 polypeptides encoded by the hepatic mitochondrial genome. This alteration in mitochondrial protein synthesis is due to modifications in mitochondrial ribosomes. In the current study, the nature of these alterations was investigated by determining some of the hydrodynamic properties, namely sedimentation coefficient, shape, and mass of mitochondrial ribosomes. The effect of ethanol consumption on the capacity for mitochondrial ribosomes to translate proteins was also determined using an in vitro Poly (U) assay system. Rats were fed the Lieber–DeCarli diet for 31 days with ethanol as 36% of total calories. The sedimentation coefficient, measured by sedimentation velocity analyses, was slightly, but significantly lower in ethanol mitochondrial ribosomes (53.2 ± 0.5S) when compared with pair-fed controls (54.1 ± 0.5S) (P = 0.04). Mitochondrial ribosomes from ethanol-fed animals also had a greater tendency to dissociate into subunits. The diffusion coefficient, determined by dynamic light scattering, was lower in mitochondrial ribosomes from ethanol-fed rats than pair-fed controls and this indicated a significantly greater diameter for ethanol ribosomes (42.1 ± 0.2 nm) than for preparations from pair-fed controls (39.1 ± 0.5 nm; P = 0.008). These alterations to ethanol mitochondrial ribosomes occurred despite no change in molecular mass, which suggested a significant ethanol-related shape change in the ribosomes. The translation capacity of mitochondrial ribosome preparations from ethanol-fed animals was markedly reduced due to dissociation of the monosome into light and heavy subunits. In summary, these observations demonstrate that chronic ethanol consumption causes significant structural and functional alterations to mitochondrial ribosomes. The loss in ribosome function leads to impaired mitochondrial polypeptide synthesis and is an example of a pathology giving rise to an alteration in the mitochondrial ribosome structure.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol treatment induces oxidative stress by a combination of increased production of partially reduced oxygen species and decreased cellular antioxidant pool, including GSH. Recently, we showed that mitochondrion-targeted CYP2E1 augments alcohol-mediated toxicity, causing an increase in reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress. Here, we show that cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal oxidase of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a critical target of CYP2E1-mediated alcohol toxicity. COS-7 and Hep G2 cell lines expressing predominantly mitochondrion-targeted (Mt++) CYP2E1 and livers from alcohol-treated rats showed loss of CcO activity and increased protein carbonylation, which was accompanied by a decline in the steady state levels of subunits I, IVI1, and Vb of the CcO complex. This was also accompanied by reduced mitochondrial DNA content and reduced mitochondrial mRNA. These changes were more prominent in Mt++ cells in comparison with wild type (WT) CYP2E1-expressing or ER+ (mostly microsome-targeted) cells. In addition, mitochondrion-specific antioxidants, ubiquinol conjugated to triphenyl phosphonium, triphenylphosphonium conjugated carboxyl proxyl, and the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide prevented the loss of CcO activity and the CcO subunits, most likely through reduced oxidative damage to the enzyme complex. Our results suggest that damage to CcO and dissociation of respirosome complexes are critical factors in alcohol-induced toxicity, which is augmented by mitochondrion-targeted CYP2E1. We propose that CcO is one of the direct and immediate targets of alcohol-induced toxicity causing respiratory dysfunction.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The latest surveillance report published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism showed that liver cirrhosis was the 12th leading cause of death in the United States, with a total of 29,925 deaths in 2007, 48% of which were alcohol related. The spectrum of ALD includes simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and superimposed hepatocellular carcinoma. Early work on the pathogenesis of the disease focused on ethanol metabolism–associated oxidative stress and glutathione depletion, abnormal methionine metabolism, malnutrition, and production of endotoxins that activate Kupffer cells. We review findings from recent studies that have characterized specific intracellular signaling pathways, transcriptional factors, aspects of innate immunity, chemokines, epigenetic features, microRNAs, and stem cells that are associated with ALD, improving our understanding of its pathogenesis. Despite this progress, no targeted therapies are available. The cornerstone of treatment for alcoholic hepatitis remains as it was 40 years ago: abstinence, nutritional support, and corticosteroids. There is an urgent need to develop new pathophysiology-oriented therapies. Recent translational studies of human samples and animal models have identified promising therapeutic targets.",

		"abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a primary consequence of heavy and prolonged drinking. ALD contributes to the bulk of liver disease burden worldwide. Progression of ALD is a multifactorial and multistep process that includes many genetic and environmental risk factors. The molecular pathogenesis of ALD involves alcohol metabolism and secondary mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endotoxin, cytokines and immune regulators. The histopathological manifestation of ALD occurs as an outcome of complex but controlled interactions between hepatic cell types. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the key drivers of fibrogenesis, but transformation of hepatocytes to myofibroblastoids also implicate parenchymal cells as playing an active role in hepatic fibrogenesis. Recent discoveries indicate that lipogenesis during the early stages of ALD is a risk for advancement to cirrhosis. Other recently identified novel molecules and physiological/cell signaling pathways include fibrinolysis, osteopontin, transforming growth factor-β-SMAD and hedgehog signaling, and involvement of novel cytokines in hepatic fibrogenesis. The observation that ALD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis share common pathways and genetic polymorphisms suggests operation of parallel pathogenic mechanisms. Future research involving genomics, epigenomics, deep sequencing and non-coding regulatory elements holds promise to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALD. There is also a need for adequate animal models to study pathogenic mechanisms at the molecular level and targeted therapy.",

Here, we measure the effects of two relatively low doses of alcohol (0.25 g/kg and 0.5 g/kg, or 5 to 10 mM in total body H2O) on glucose metabolism in the human brain. Twenty healthy control subjects were tested using positron emission tomography (PET) and FDG after placebo and after acute oral administration of either 0.25 g/kg, or 0.5 g/kg of alcohol, administered over 40 min. Both doses of alcohol significantly decreased whole-brain glucose metabolism (10% and 23% respectively). The responses differed between doses; whereas the 0.25 g/kg dose predominantly reduced metabolism in cortical regions, the 0.5 g/kg dose reduced metabolism in cortical as well as subcortical regions (i.e. cerebellum, mesencephalon, basal ganglia and thalamus). These doses of alcohol did not significantly change the scores in cognitive performance, which contrasts with our previous results showing that a 13% reduction in brain metabolism by lorazepam was associated with significant impairment in performance on the same battery of cognitive tests. This seemingly paradoxical finding raises the possibility that the large brain metabolic decrements during alcohol intoxication could reflect a shift in the substrate for energy utilization, particularly in light of new evidence that blood-borne acetate, which is markedly increased during intoxication, is a substrate for energy production by the brain.",

Using an intact in vivo rat brain (pial) model, TV image-intensification, cultured cerebral vascular muscle cells, digital-image analysis, and a novel Mg2+ ion-selective electrode to measure extracellular ionized Mg2+, studies were designed to determine whether: 1) perivascular or systemic administration (IV or intra-arterial) of magnesium aspartate HCl (MgA) exert vasodilator effects on arterioles (65–130 μm o.d.) and venules (60–135 μm); 2) nonvasodilator doses of MgA could modify vascular spasms induced by BaCl2 and ethanol; 3) nonvasodilator doses of MgA could ameliorate or prevent the cerebral vascular damage induced by high doses of ethanol; and 4) ethanol depletes cerebral vascular muscle of intracellular Mg ions ([Mg2+]i). Perivascular application of MgA (0.01–100 μmol) produced dose-dependent vasodilatation of cerebral arterioles and venules; arterioles yielded greater vasodilator responses compared to venules. Nonvasodilator doses of Mg (1.0, 4.0 μmol/min), administered IV or intra-arterially, into a branch of the internal carotid artery, prevented: 1) the spasmogenic actions of ethanol and Ba2+; and 2) the vasculotoxic actions (rupture of postcapillary venules and focal hemorrhages) of ethanol. In addition, ethanol depleted cerebral vascular muscle cells of [Mg2+]i; blood levels of ionized Mg2+ rose after IP ethanol. Despite the fact that systemic infusion of low nonvasodilator doses did not result in dilatation of the pial arterioles and venules, plasma total and ionized Mg rose 18–230%, depending upon doses of MgA and time of plasma sampling. These data support the idea that Mg2+ can act as a local vasodilator on brain microvessels and possess antispasmodic properties on brain arterioles and venules. In addition, our results indicate that Mg may posses some unique cerebral vascular protective properties against the vasculotoxic effects of ethanol. Lastly, these findings suggest ethanol-induced cerebrovasospasm and vascular damage appear to be associated with a rapid loss of [Mg2+]i from cerebral vascular muscle cells.",

It is suggested that liver carcinogenesis, chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are the result of reactive oxygen species production because of mitochondrial dysfunction. The advancement of therapeutic approaches to protect mitochondria heralds a new strategy to halt progressive liver diseases and carcinogenesis.",

However, the exact sites of ROS production within liver mitochondria and the electron transport chain are still uncertain. To determine the sites of ROS generation in liver mitochondria we evaluated the ability of a variety of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors to alter the steady state levels of ROS generated within the intact hepatocyte and in isolated mitochondria. Treatment with myxothiazol alone at concentrations that significantly inhibit respiration dramatically increased the steady-state levels of ROS in hepatocytes. Similar results were also observed in isolated mitochondria oxidizing succinate. Coincubation with antimycin or rotenone had no effect on myxothiazol-induced ROS levels. Myxothiazol stimulation of ROS was mitochondrial in origin as demonstrated by the colocalization of MitoTracker Red and dichlorofluorescein staining using confocal microscopy. Furthermore, diphenyliodonium, an inhibitor that blocks electron flow through the flavin mononucleotide of mitochondrial complex I and other flavoenzymes, significantly attenuated the myxothiazol-induced increase in hepatocyte ROS levels. Together, these data suggest that in addition to the ubiquinone–cytochrome bc1 complex of complex III, several of the flavin-containing enzymes or iron–sulfur centers within the mitochondrial electron transport chain should also be considered sites of superoxide generation in liver mitochondria.",

Reactive oxygen species production was detected using the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence assay and cell injury was determined by lactate dehydrogenase release. Incubation with 1 and 10 mM ethanol increased the production of reactive oxygen species by 72% and 151%, respectively, which was associated with mild decreases in cell viability. Antimycin, a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, elicited a 17-fold increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species and markedly decreased hepatocyte viability and ATP levels. Ethanol increased reactive oxygen species production and the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio in antimycin-treated cells. Rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that allows electron flow through the flavin mononucleotide (FMN), but prevents electron flow to complex III, significantly increased reactive oxygen species production in untreated cells, but decreased reactive oxygen species production in antimycin plus ethanol-treated cells. Diphenyliodonium, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that inhibits electron flow through FMN, attenuated reactive oxygen species generation in all groups. Fructose prevented cytotoxicity in all treatment groups. Though they do not eliminate the participation of other intracellular compartments, these results indicate that the NADH dehydrogenase complex, as well as complex III of mitochondria, are involved in ethanol-related production of reactive oxygen species.",

The mechanism by which ethanol triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species in the liver is complex, however, recent findings suggest that the mitochondrion may contribute significantly to the overall increase in oxidant levels in hepatocytes exposed to ethanol acutely or chronically. This review is focused on observations which indicate that the ability of ethanol to increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production is linked to its metabolism via oxidative processes and/or ethanol-related alterations to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Furthermore, the capacity of ethanol-elicited increases in reactive oxygen species to oxidatively modify and inactivate mitochondrial proteins is highlighted as a mechanism by which ethanol might further disrupt the structure and function of mitochondria.",

Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which alcohol maintains hepatic inflammation are still characterized incompletely. Several studies have demonstrated that ethanol-induced oxidative stress promotes immune responses in ALD by stimulating both humoral and cellular reactions against liver proteins adducted to hydroxyethyl free radicals and several lipid peroxidation products. Moreover, ALD patients have autoantibodies targeting cytochrome P4502E1 and oxidized phospholipids. In both chronic alcohol-fed rats and heavy drinkers, the elevation of IgG against lipid peroxidation-derived antigens is associated with tumor necrosis factor-α production and the severity of liver inflammation. On this basis, we propose that allo- and autoimmune reactions associated with oxidative stress might contribute to fueling hepatic inflammation in ALD.",

Recent reports have implicated oxidative mechanisms in the onset of alcoholic steatosis and in the formation of Mallory’s bodies. Moreover, by inducing mitochondrial alterations, oxidative stress promotes hepatocyte necrosis and contributes to alcohol-induced sensitization of hepatocyte to the pro-apoptotic action of TNF-α. Oxidative mechanisms play also a role in the progression of liver fibrosis by triggering the release of pro-fibrotic cytokines and activating collagen gene expression in hepatic stellate cells. Finally, immune responses towards antigens originating from the reactions of lipid peroxidation products with hepatic proteins might represent one of the mechanisms that contribute to perpetuate chronic hepatic inflammation in ALD. Altogether these observations give a rationale to the possible clinical application of antioxidants in the therapy of ALD.",

		"abstract": "We provide an integrative interpretation of neuroglial metabolic coupling including the presence of subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate and monocarboxylate recycling through the plasma membrane of both neurons and glial cells. The subcellular compartmentation of pyruvate allows neurons and astrocytes to select between glucose and lactate as alternative substrates, depending on their relative extracellular concentration and the operation of a redox switch. This mechanism is based on the inhibition of glycolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by NAD+ limitation, under sufficiently reduced cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox conditions. Lactate and pyruvate recycling through the plasma membrane allows the return to the extracellular medium of cytosolic monocarboxylates enabling their transcellular, reversible, exchange between neurons and astrocytes. Together, intracellular pyruvate compartmentation and monocarboxylate recycling result in an effective transcellular coupling between the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox states of both neurons and glial cells. Following glutamatergic neurotransmission, increased glutamate uptake by the astrocytes is proposed to augment glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, balancing to a reduced cytosolic NAD+/NADH in the glia. Reducing equivalents are transferred then to the neuron resulting in a reduced neuronal NAD+/NADH redox state. This may eventually switch off neuronal glycolysis, favoring the oxidation of extracellular lactate in the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) equilibrium and in the neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycles. Finally, pyruvate derived from neuronal lactate oxidation, may return to the extracellular space and to the astrocyte, restoring the basal redox state and beginning a new loop of the lactate/pyruvate transcellular coupling cycle. Transcellular redox coupling operates through the plasma membrane transporters of monocarboxylates, similarly to the intracellular redox shuttles coupling the cytosolic and mitochondrial redox states through the transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Finally, transcellular redox coupling mechanisms may couple glycolytic and oxidative zones in other heterogeneous tissues including muscle and tumors.",

		"abstract": "In this study, we investigated how colonic epithelial cells maintained pyridine nucleotide (NADH/NAD+) redox homeostasis upon acute metabolic variation imposed by glucose deprivation or supplementation with mitochondrial substrates, succinate and malate/glutamate (M/G). Our results showed that low glucose caused cellular NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance that diminished lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and resulted in lower lactate contents. The concurrent activation of malic enzyme (ME) suggested a role for malate in preserving cellular pyruvate that remained unchanged at low glucose. Mitochondrial substrates restored cellular NADH/NAD+ redox homeostasis at low glucose in association with specific compartmental catabolism of mitochondrial substrates. As compared with normal glucose, M/G and low glucose promoted glycolytic ATP production but inhibited mitochondrial-derived ATP generation in association with decreased glucose availability for mitochondrial respiration. At normal glucose, succinate and M/G enhanced mitochondrial respiratory activity, but had minimal impact on mitochondrial-derived ATP production. Collectively, these results are consistent with low glucose-induced NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance in association with decreased aerobic glycolysis that is reversed by supplementation with M/G but not succinate.",

Thiols in proteins can undergo a wide range of reversible redox modifications (e.g., S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, and disulfide formation) during times of increased exposure to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which can affect protein activity. These reversible thiol modifications regulated by GSH may be nanoswitches to turn on and off proteins, similar to phosphorylation, in cells. In the cytoplasm, an altered redox state can activate (e.g., MAPKs and NF-E2-related factor-2) and inhibit (e.g., phosphatases and caspases) proteins, whereas in the nucleus, redox alterations can inhibit DNA binding of transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB and activator protein-1). The consequences include the promotion of expression of antioxidant genes and alterations of hepatocyte survival as well as the balance between necrotic versus apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the understanding of the redox regulation of proteins may have important clinical ramifications in understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases.",

		"abstract": "Accumulation of oxidative damage has been implicated to be a major causative factor in the decline in physiological functions that occur during the aging process. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is a powerful source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), considered as the pathogenic agent of many diseases and aging. L-malate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, plays an important role in transporting NADH from cytosol to mitochondria for energy production. Previous studies in our laboratory reported L-malate as a free radical scavenger in aged rats. In the present study we focused on the effect of L-malate on the activities of electron transport chain in young and aged rats. We found that mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase in liver of aged rats were significantly decreased when compared to young control rats. Supplementation of L-malate to aged rats for 30 days slightly increased MMP and improved the activities of NADH-dehydrogenase, NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase in liver of aged rats when compared with aged control rats. In young rats, L-malate administration increased only the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase. Our result suggested that L-malate could improve the activities of electron transport chain enzymes in aged rats.",

		"abstract": "Liver mitochondria from rats fed ethanol chronically demonstrate an impaired ability to incorporate [35S]methionine into polypeptide products in vitro. This ethanol-induced effect on mitochondrial translation in vitro could not be attributed to significant differences in the methionine precursor pool sizes of ethanol and control mitochondria or to the acute effects of residual ethanol. The observed reduction of radiolabeled methionine incorporation into mitochondrial gene products of ethanol mitochondria in vitro reflects a decrease in the synthesis of all the mitochondrial gene products. However, the percentage of total radiolabel incorporated into each gene product is unaffected by ethanol, suggesting an ethanol-induced coordinate depression of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Moreover, SDS-PAGE and densitometry of submitochondrial particles from ethanol-fed and control rats demonstrated that the steady-state concentration of each of the mitochondrial gene products is decreased in ethanol-fed rats. This reduction of the steady-state concentration of the mitochondrial gene products may be related to the observed depressions of oxidative phosphorylation activities associated with hepatic mitochondria from ethanol-fed rats.",

		"abstract": "The effects of xanthan gum on the release of strawberry flavor compounds in formulated soy protein isolate (SPI) beverage were investigated by headspace gas chromatography (GC). Seven strawberry flavor compounds (limonene, ethyl hexanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and diacetyl) could be detected by GC and hence analyzed the gas-matrix partition coefficients (K). The release of flavor compounds was restrained in SPI and/or xanthan gum solution. The retention of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, limonene and diacetyl significantly changed (p<0.05) with increasing xanthan gum concentrations. Presence of any other esters led to suppression of the release of ester compounds in water and SPI solution. The less-volatiles (γ-decalactone, methyl cinnamate, hexanoic acid, 2-methyl butyric acid and furaneol) accelerated the release of ester compounds to some extent in different matrices. The above results demonstrated that presence of SPI and xanthan gum could bring about an imbalance in the strawberry flavor.",

Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and GC-MS were used to study the effects of varying concentrations of xanthan gum, sucrose fatty acid ester, Tween 80 and soybean lecithin on the release of seven aroma compounds. The effects of the emulsifier systems supplemented with xanthan gum on aroma release were also studied in the same way. The results showed varying degrees of influence of sucrose fatty acid ester, soybean lecithin, Tween 80 and xanthan gum on the release of aroma compounds. Compared with other aroma compounds, ethyl acetate was more likely to be conserved in the solution system, while the amount of limonene released was the highest among these seven aroma compounds. In conclusion, different emulsifiers and complexes showed different surface properties that tend to interact with different aroma molecules. The present studies showed that the composition and structure of emulsifiers and specific interactions between emulsifiers and aroma molecules have significant effects on aroma release.",

		"abstract": "In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, abnormalities in secretion, absorption, motility, and sensation have been implicated in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Ion channels play important roles in all these GI functions. Disruptions of ion channels' ability to conduct ions can lead to diseases called ion channelopathies. Channelopathies can result from changes in ion channel biophysical function or expression due to mutations, posttranslational modification, and accessory protein malfunction. Channelopathies are strongly established in the fields of cardiology and neurology, but ion channelopathies are only beginning to be recognized in gastroenterology. In this review, we describe the state of the emerging field of GI ion channelopathies. Several recent discoveries show that channelopathies result in alterations in GI motility, secretion, and sensation. In the epithelium, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or CFTR-associating proteins result in channelopathies with constipation or diarrhea as phenotypes. In the muscle, mutations in the SCN5A-encoded voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 are associated with irritable bowel syndrome. In the sensory nerves, channelopathies of voltage-gated sodium channels NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 (encoded by SCN9A, SCN11A, respectively) manifest by either GI hyper- or hyposensation. Recent advances in structural biology and ion channel biophysics, coupled with personalized medicine, have fueled rapid discoveries of novel channelopathies and direct drug targeting of specific channelopathies. In summary, the emerging field of GI ion channelopathies has significant implications for functional GI disease stratification, diagnosis, and treatment.",

The objectives of this research include identifying components of starch structure that confer digestion resistance, developing novel plants and starches, and modifying foods to incorporate these starches. Furthermore, recent and ongoing studies address the impact of digestion-resistant starches on the prevention and control of chronic human diseases, including diabetes, colon cancer, and obesity. This review provides a transdisciplinary overview of this field, including a description of types of resistant starches; factors in plants that affect digestion resistance; methods for starch analysis; challenges in developing food products with resistant starches; mammalian intestinal and gut bacterial metabolism; potential effects on gut microbiota; and impacts and mechanisms for the prevention and control of colon cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Although this has been an active area of research and considerable progress has been made, many questions regarding how to best use digestion-resistant starches in human diets for disease prevention must be answered before the full potential of resistant starches can be realized.",

		"abstract": "Impaired gut barrier function plays an important role in the development of many diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and in HIV infection. Dietary fibres have been shown to improve intestinal barrier function through their fermentation products, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the effects of individual SCFAs have been studied. Here, different SCFA mixtures representing possible compositions from fibre fermentation products were studied for protective and reparative effects on intestinal barrier function. The effect of fermentation products from four dietary fibres, i.e. resistant starch, fructooligosaccharides, and sorghum and corn arabinoxylan (varying in their branched structure) on barrier function was positively correlated with their SCFA concentration. Pure SCFA mixtures of various concentrations and compositions were tested using a Caco-2 cell model. SCFAs at a moderate concentration (40–80 mM) improved barrier function without causing damage to the monolayer. In a 40 mM SCFA mixture, the butyrate proportion at 20% and 50% showed both a protective and a reparative effect on the monolayer to disrupting agents (LPS/TNF-α) applied simultaneously or prior to the SCFA mixtures. Relating this result to dietary fibre selection, slow fermenting fibres that deliver appropriate concentrations of SCFAs to the epithelium with a high proportion of butyrate may improve barrier function.",

		"abstract": "Background: High-amylose-maize resistant starch type 2 (HAMRS2) is a fermentable dietary fiber known to alter the gut milieu, including the gut microbiota, which may explain the reported effects of resistant starch to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction.\nObjective: Our working hypothesis was that HAMRS2-induced microbiome changes alter gut-derived signals (i.e., xenometabolites) reaching the liver via the portal circulation, in turn altering liver metabolism by regulating gene expression and other pathways.\nMethods: We used a multi-omics systems biology approach to characterize HAMRS2-driven shifts to the cecal microbiome, liver metabolome, and transcriptome, identifying correlates between microbial changes and liver metabolites under obesogenic conditions that, to our knowledge, have not previously been recognized. Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed an energy-dense 45% lard-based-fat diet for 10 wk supplemented with either 20% HAMRS2 by weight (n = 14) or rapidly digestible starch (control diet; n = 15).\nResults: Despite no differences in food intake, body weight, glucose tolerance, fasting plasma insulin, or liver triglycerides, the HAMRS2 mice showed a 15–58% reduction in all measured liver amino acids, except for Gln, compared with control mice. These metabolites were equivalent in the plasma of HAMRS2 mice compared with controls, and transcripts encoding key amino acid transporters were not different in the small intestine or liver, suggesting that HAMRS2 effects were not simply due to lower hepatocyte exposure to systemic amino acids. Instead, alterations in gut microbial metabolism could have affected host nitrogen and amino acid homeostasis: HAMRS2 mice showed a 62% increase (P < 0.0001) in 48-h fecal output and a 41% increase (P < 0.0001) in fecal nitrogen compared with control mice. Beyond amino acid metabolism, liver transcriptomics revealed pathways related to lipid and xenobiotic metabolism; and pathways related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth were affected by HAMRS2 feeding.\nConclusion: Together, these differences indicate that HAMRS2 dramatically alters hepatic metabolism and gene expression concurrent with shifts in specific gut bacteria in C57BL/6J mice.",

Human DCs and reporter cells for TLRs were incubated with starches and analyzed for NF-kB/AP-1 activation. Complex coculture systems were applied to study the cross-talk. High-maize® 260 predominantly binds to TLR2 while Novelose® 330 binds to TLR2 and TLR5. The strong immune-stimulating effects of High-maize® 260 were attenuated by starch-exposed IECs illustrating the regulatory function of IECs. Despite these attenuating effects, DCs kept producing Th1 cytokines.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nResistant starch possesses direct signaling capacity on human DCs in a starch-type-dependent manner. IECs regulate these responses. High-maize® 260 skews toward a more regulatory phenotype in coculture systems of DCs, IEC, and T cells.",

		"abstract": "In patients with severe alcoholic liver disease (i.e., cirrhosis), a deficiency of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) develops as a result of decreased SAMe synthetase activity. Whether a sizeable SAMe depletion occurs already at earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease has been the subject of debate. To address this issue, rats were fed alcohol (or isocaloric carbohydrate) in Lieber–DeCarli liquid diets containing adequate amounts of protein, vitamins, and lipotropic factors, including methionine. Alcohol feeding resulted in hepatic steatosis (without fibrosis) and unchanged SAMe synthetase activity, yet SAMe concentration was already greatly decreased. This most likely resulted from oxidative stress associated with the metabolism of alcohol and the induction of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1), which generates free radicals. Indeed, the decrease in hepatic SAMe correlated with parameters of oxidative stress, such as increased 4-hydroxynonenal (measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) and diminished glutathione (GSH). Decreased GSH, occurring as a result of excessive GSH consumption caused by the oxidative stress, probably generated by enhanced utilization of SAMe, a precursor of GSH, thereby explaining the depletion of SAMe. In view of the known differences between rodents and primates in the metabolism of lipotropes, my colleagues and I have also studied the interaction between alcohol and SAMe in baboons and found again that, at early stages preceding the development of cirrhosis, there was already a significant lowering of hepatic SAMe concentration, associated with a striking oxidative stress documented by decreased levels and accelerated turnover of GSH. This was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and damage to cellular membranes, including those of the mitochondria, assessed by electron microscopy. Oral administration of SAMe resulted in its hepatic repletion with a corresponding attenuation of the ethanol-induced oxidative stress and liver injury, with significantly less GSH depletion, less increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, less leakage of mitochondrial glutamic dehydrogenase into the plasma, and fewer megamitochondria. In conclusion, (1) both in rodents and in non-human primates, significant SAMe depletion occurs already at early stages of alcoholic liver disease, despite the consumption of adequate diets; (2) the decreased hepatic SAMe concentration and the associated liver lesions, including mitochondrial injury, can be corrected with SAMe supplementation; and (3) accordingly, therapeutic administration of SAMe should be the subject of a comprehensive clinical trial to assess its capacity to attenuate early stages of alcoholic liver injury in human beings.",

		"abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress has been associated with tissue injury in alcoholic liver disease. Although this close association is well known, whether prevention of oxidative stress retards tissue injury has not been thoroughly investigated., Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of supplementation with vitamins E and C on antioxidant enzyme status and histologic changes in hepatic tissue in a rat model of alcoholic liver disease., Methods: This 8-week, blinded, controlled study was conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey. Weanling albino female protein-deficient Wistar rats weighing ∼200 g were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups: (1) liquid diet+ethanol+vitamin E 15 mg/kg PO (LDetvitE); (2) liquid diet+ethanol+vitamin C 10 mg/kg PO (LDetvitC); (3) liquid diet+ethanol+vitamin E 15 mg/kg+vitamin C 10 mg/kg PO (LDetvitEC); (4) liquid diet+ethanol (LDet); (5) liquid diet+isocaloric sucrose (LDS); and (6) normal diet (control). The primary end point of the study was to determine whether antioxidant vitamin E/C combination therapy prevents development of hepatic fibrosis (ie, cirrhosis in a period of 1 year). After being euthanized at week 8, the rats were weighed, and their livers and spleens were weighed. Hepatic tissue specimens were histopathologically assessed according to the Brunt system. Hepatic tissue glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were determined. Biochemical tissue collagen concentrations were measured to determine the presence of hepatic fibrosis., Results: Seventy-two rats were included in the study (mean [SE] weight, 205 [21] g) (12 rats per group). Initially planned to last 48 weeks, the study was terminated at 8 weeks due to the death of 3 rats in each group (except the LDS group and control group). The relative liver weight was significantly lower in the LDetvitEC group compared with that in the LDet group (mean [SE], 3.7% [0.5%] vs 4.8% [0.9%]; P<0.01). Mean (SE) hepatic tissue glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly reduced in the LDet-treated rats compared with controls (1.2 [0.2] vs 2.6 [0.3] U/mg protein; P<0.001). The groups that received supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, and vitamins E and C combined had significantly more hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity (mean [SE], 2.1 [0.5], 2.5 [0.2], and 2.6 [0.7] U/mg protein, respectively) compared with the LDet group (1.2 [0.2] U/mg protein) (all, P<0.001). No significant between-group differences in hepatic superoxide dismutase or catalase activities were found. Compared with controls (14.5 [1.9] μg collagen/mg protein), the mean (SE) histologic hepatic collagen concentration was significantly higher in all groups (19.2 [1.2], 19.5 [3.3], 18.5 [3.0], 25.9 [3.3], and 21.6 [1.5] μg collagen/mg protein in the LDetvitE, LDetvitC, LDetvitEC, LDet, and LDS groups, respectively; P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). Compared with the LDet group, the mean hepatic collagen concentration was significantly lower in the LDetvitE, LDetvitC, and LDetvitEC groups (P<0.01, P<0.05, and P<0.01, respectively). The LDetvitEC group had a significantly lower mean (SE) hepatic inflammatory score compared with the LDet group (0.8 [0.1] vs 1.3 [0.2]; P<0.05). The LDetvitEC group had a significantly lower mean (SE) hepatic necrosis score compared with that in the LDet group (1.5 [0.2] vs 2.4 [0.3]; P<0.05)., Conclusions: The results of this study in protein-deficient rats fed with a high-fat liquid diet suggest that supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, and a combination of vitamins E and C was associated with decreased ethanol-induced hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity and hepatic fibrosis, and that supplementation with vitamins E and C might have attenuated the development of hepatomegaly and hepatic necroinflammation, whereas this result was not found in the group given a liquid diet and ethanol in this 8-week study.

To increase GSH levels, the additional supply of GSH precursors was suggested. In this study we evaluated the potency of a single and combined administration of the GSH modulating substances glutamine (GLN), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and glycine (GLY) as well as R,S-α-lipoic acid (LA) to enhance intracellular GSH content in a well-defined model system. Results: Exposure of myelomonocytic U937 cells for 24h to GLN revealed a 1.5-fold enhancement of GSH levels with a concomitant decrease in the formation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Addition of NAC stimulated GSH formation only at subphysiological GLN levels. GLY enhanced GSH levels under GLN starvation, but caused a diminution of GSH content under optimal GLN supply. LA in combination with 2mmol/l GLN evoked a 3.6-fold enhancement of GSH content compared to GLN starved cells. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the GSH content of U937 cells is dependent on the supply of GLN, NAC, LA, and GLY. Combinations of the single substances can enhance but also decrease the intracellular GSH content, which is of clinical importance when supplying GSH-modulating substances to patients.",

		"abstract": "Glutamine (GLN) is the most abundant free amino acid (AA) in the human body. Under GLN-free conditions, which can be obtained when cells are cultivated in vitro, tissue cells cannot grow. Therefore, when classifying GLN as a \"non-essential\" AA, one must consider that in the human body GLN is synthesized from essential AAs and is continuously delivered from skeletal muscle to other organs. It is fascinating that a relatively simple AA like GLN can stimulate a large variety of cellular reactions. GLN stimulates not only the growth of cells but also the expression of surface antigens, the formation of cytokines, and the synthesis of heat shock proteins. Further, a GLN deficiency leads to a cell cycle arrest in G(0) to G(1) and reduces apoptosis. Interestingly, many of these biological activities also are associated with the cellular reduced oxygen potential, which depends mainly on the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione. Experimental animal studies have shown that the administration of GLN increases tissue concentrations of reduced glutathione. This review describes the relation of GLN to reduced glutathione metabolism and discusses the alteration of reduced glutathione metabolism under a variety of clinical conditions such as reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, respiratory insufficiency, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, and clinical protein catabolism.",

		"abstract": "The major processes discussed below are protein turnover (degradation and synthesis), degradation into urea, or conversion into glucose (gluconeogenesis, Figure 1). Daily protein turnover is a dynamic process characterized by a double flux of amino acids: the amino acids released by endogenous (body) protein breakdown can be reutilized and reconverted to protein synthesis, with very little loss. Daily rates of protein turnover in humans (300 to 400 g per day) are largely in excess of the level of protein intake (50 to 80 g per day). A fast growing rate, as in premature babies or in children recovering from malnutrition, leads to a high protein turnover rate and a high protein and energy requirement. Protein metabolism (synthesis and breakdown) is an energy-requiring process, dependent upon endogenous ATP supply. The contribution made by whole-body protein turnover to the resting metabolic rate is important: it represents about 20 % in adults and more in growing children. Metabolism of proteins cannot be disconnected from that of energy since energy balance influences net protein utilization, and since protein intake has an important effect on postprandial thermogenesis - more important than that of fats or carbohydrates. The metabolic need for amino acids is essentially to maintain stores of endogenous tissue proteins within an appropriate range, allowing protein homeostasis to be maintained. Thanks to a dynamic, free amino acid pool, this demand for amino acids can be continuously supplied. The size of the free amino acid pool remains limited and is regulated within narrow limits. The supply of amino acids to cover physiological needs can be derived from 3 sources: \t1.\tExogenous proteins that release amino acids after digestion and absorption \t2.\tTissue protein breakdown during protein turnover \t3.\tDe novo synthesis, including amino acids (as well as ammonia) derived from the process of urea salvage, following hydrolysis and microflora metabolism in the hind gut.  When protein intake surpasses the physiological needs of amino acids, the excess amino acids are disposed of by three major processes: \t1.\tIncreased oxidation, with terminal end products such as CO2 and ammonia \t2.\tEnhanced ureagenesis i. e. synthesis of urea linked to protein oxidation eliminatesthe nitrogen radical \t3.\tGluconeogenesis, i. e. de novo synthesis of glucose.  Most of the amino groups of the excess amino acids are converted into urea through the urea cycle, whereas their carbon skeletons are transformed into other intermediates, mostly glucose. This is one of the mechanisms, essential for life, developed by the body to maintain blood glucose within a narrow range, (i. e. glucose homeostasis). It includes the process of gluconeogenesis, i. e. de novo synthesis of glucose from non-glycogenic precursors; in particular certain specific amino acids (for example, alanine), as well as glycerol (derived from fat breakdown) and lactate (derived from muscles). The gluconeogenetic pathway progressively takes over when the supply of glucose from exogenous or endogenous sources (glycogenolysis) becomes insufficient. This process becomes vital during periods of metabolic stress, such as starvation.",

		"abstract": "In the post-absorptive state, ammonia is produced in equal amounts in the small and large bowel. Small intestinal synthesis of ammonia is related to amino acid breakdown, whereas large bowel ammonia production is caused by bacterial breakdown of amino acids and urea. The contribution of the gut to the hyperammonemic state observed during liver failure is mainly due to portacaval shunting and not the result of changes in the metabolism of ammonia in the gut. Patients with liver disease have reduced urea synthesis capacity and reduced peri-venous glutamine synthesis capacity, resulting in reduced capacity to detoxify ammonia in the liver. The kidneys produce ammonia but adapt to liver failure in experimental portacaval shunting by reducing ammonia release into the systemic circulation. The kidneys have the ability to switch from net ammonia production to net ammonia excretion, which is beneficial for the hyperammonemic patient. Data in experimental animals suggest that the kidneys could have a major role in post-feeding and post-haemorrhagic hyperammonemia. During hyperammonemia, muscle takes up ammonia and plays a major role in (temporarily) detoxifying ammonia to glutamine. Net uptake of ammonia by the brain occurs in patients and experimental animals with acute and chronic liver failure. Concomitant release of glutamine has been demonstrated in experimental animals, together with large increases of the cerebral cortex ammonia and glutamine concentrations. In this review we will discuss interorgan trafficking of ammonia during acute and chronic liver failure. Interorgan glutamine metabolism is also briefly discussed, since glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is an important alternative pathway of ammonia detoxification. The main ammonia producing organs are the intestines and the kidneys, whereas the major ammonia consuming organs are the liver and the muscle.",

		"abstract": "The article explains the pathogenesis of disturbances in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) and protein metabolism in various forms of hepatic injury and it is suggested that the main cause of decrease in plasma BCAA concentration in liver cirrhosis is hyperammonemia. Three possible targets of BCAA supplementation in hepatic disease are suggested: (1) hepatic encephalopathy, (2) liver regeneration, and (3) hepatic cachexia. The BCAA may ameliorate hepatic encephalopathy by promoting ammonia detoxification, correction of the plasma amino acid imbalance, and by reduced brain influx of aromatic amino acids. The influence of BCAA supplementation on hepatic encephalopathy could be more effective in chronic hepatic injury with hyperammonemia and low concentrations of BCAA in blood than in acute hepatic illness, where hyperaminoacidemia frequently develops. The favorable effect of BCAA on liver regeneration and nutritional state of the body is related to their stimulatory effect on protein synthesis, secretion of hepatocyte growth factor, glutamine production and inhibitory effect on proteolysis. Presumably the beneficial effect of BCAA on hepatic cachexia is significant in compensated liver disease with decreased plasma BCAA concentrations, whereas it is less pronounced in hepatic diseases with inflammatory complications and enhanced protein turnover. It is concluded that specific benefits associated with BCAA supplementation depend significantly on the type of liver disease and on the presence of inflammatory reaction. An important task for clinical research is to identify groups of patients for whom BCAA treatment can significantly improve the health-related quality of life and the prognosis of hepatic disease.",

		"abstract": "This review addresses the ammonia fatigue theory in light of new evidence from exercise and disease studies and aims to provide a view of the role of ammonia during exercise. Hyperammonemia is a condition common to pathological liver disorders and intense or exhausting exercise. In pathology, hyperammonemia is linked to impairment of normal brain function and the onset of the neurological condition, hepatic encephalopathy. Elevated blood ammonia concentrations arise due to a diminished capacity for removal via the liver and lead to increased exposure of organs, such as the brain, to the toxic effects of ammonia. High levels of brain ammonia can lead to deleterious alterations in astrocyte morphology, cerebral energy metabolism and neurotransmission, which may in turn impact on the functioning of important signalling pathways within the neuron. Such changes are believed to contribute to the disturbances in neuropsychological function, in particular the learning, memory, and motor control deficits observed in animal models of liver disease and also patients with cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia in exercise occurs as a result of an increased production by contracting muscle, through adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deamination (the purine nucleotide cycle) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) deamination prior to oxidation. Plasma concentrations of ammonia during exercise often achieve or exceed those measured in liver disease patients, resulting in increased cerebral uptake. In this article we propose that exercise-induced hyperammonemia may lead to concomitant disturbances in brain function, potentially through similar mechanisms underpinning pathology, which may impact on performance as fatigue or reduced function, especially during extreme exercise.",

We investigated the effect of ethanol and acetaldehyde on polyamine metabolism since polyamines are essential factors for normal cellular functions. We found that acetaldehyde induced spermine oxidase (SMO) at the transcriptional level in HepG2 cells. The levels and activities of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) were not affected by acetaldehyde. Spermidine content was increased and spermine content was decreased by acetaldehyde treatment. Knockdown of SMO expression using siRNA reduced acetaldehyde toxicity. Acetaldehyde exposure increased free acrolein levels. An increase of acrolein by acetaldehyde was SMO dependent. Our results indicate that cytotoxicity of acetaldehyde involves, at least in part, oxidation of spermine to spermidine by SMO, which is induced by acetaldehyde.",

		"abstract": "Background\nBackground\n\nWeight loss and muscle wasting are commonly found in patients with end-stage liver disease. Since there is an association between malnutrition and poor clinical outcome, such patients (or those at risk of becoming malnourished) are often given parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, or oral nutritional supplements. These interventions have costs and adverse effects, so it is important to prove that their use results in improved morbidity or mortality, or both.\n\nObjectives\nObjectives\n\nTo assess the beneficial and harmful effects of parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, and oral nutritional supplements on the mortality and morbidity of patients with underlying liver disease.\n\nSearch methods\nSearch methods\n\nThe following computerised databases were searched: the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded (January 2012). In addition, reference lists of identified trials and review articles and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched. Trials identified in a previous systematic handsearch of Index Medicus were also considered. Handsearches of a number of medical journals, including abstracts from annual meetings, were done. Experts in the field and manufacturers of nutrient formulations were contacted for potential references.\n\nSelection criteria\nSelection criteria\n\nRandomised clinical trials (parallel or cross-over design) comparing groups of patients with any underlying liver disease who received, or did not receive, enteral or parenteral nutrition or oral nutritional supplements were identified without restriction on date, language, or publication status. Six categories of trials were separately considered: medical or surgical patients receiving parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, or supplements.\n\nData collection and analysis\nData collection and analysis\n\nThe following data were sought in each report: date of publication; geographical location; inclusion and exclusion criteria; the type of nutritional support and constitution of the nutrient formulation; duration of treatment; any nutrition provided to the controls; other interventions provided to the patients; number, sex, age of the study participants; hospital or outpatient status; underlying liver disease; risks of bias (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome reporting, intention-to-treat analysis, selective outcome reporting, others (vested interests, baseline imbalance, early stopping)); mortality; hepatic morbidity (development or resolution of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding); quality of life scores; adverse events; infections; lengths of stay in the hospital or intensive care unit; costs; serum bilirubin; postoperative complications (surgical trials only); and nutritional outcomes (nitrogen balance, anthropometric measurements, body weight). The primary outcomes of this review were mortality, hepatic morbidity, quality of life, and adverse events. Data were extracted in duplicate; differences were resolved by consensus.\nData for each outcome were combined in a meta-analysis (RevMan 5.1). Estimates were reported using risk ratios or mean differences, along with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Both fixed-effect and random-effects models were employed; fixed-effect models were reported unless one model, but not the other, found a significant difference (in which case both were reported). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Chi2 test and I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were planned to assess specific liver diseases (alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), acute or chronic liver diseases, and trials employing standard or branched-chain amino acid formulations (for the hepatic encephalopathy outcomes). Sensitivity analyses were planned to compare trials at low and high risk of bias and trials reported as full papers. The following exploratory analyses were undertaken: 1) medical and surgical trials were combined for each nutritional intervention; 2) intention-to-treat analyses in which missing dichotomous data were imputed as best- and worst-case scenarios; 3) all trials were combined to assess mortality; 4) effects were estimated by absolute risk reductions.\n\nMain results\nMain results\n\nThirty-seven trials were identified; only one was at low risk of bias. Most of the analyses failed to find any significant differences. The significant findings that were found were the following: 1) icteric medical patients receiving parenteral nutrition had a reduced serum bilirubin (mean difference (MD) -2.86 mg%, 95% CI -3.82 mg% to -1.89 mg%, 3 trials) and better nitrogen balance (MD 3.60 g/day, 95% CI 0.86 g/day to 6.34 g/day, 1 trial); 2) surgical patients receiving parenteral nutrition had a reduced incidence of postoperative ascites only in the fixed-effect model (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87, 2 trials, I2 = 70%) and one trial demonstrated a reduction in postoperative complications, especially infections (pneumonia in particular); 3) enteral nutrition may have improved nitrogen balance in medical patients (although a combination of the three trials was not possible); 4) one surgical trial of enteral nutrition found a reduction in postoperative complications; and 5) oral nutritional supplements had several effects in medical patients (reduced occurrence of ascites (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88, 3 trials), possibly (significant differences only seen in the fixed-effect model) reduced rates of infection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.99, 3 trials, I2 = 14%), and improved resolution of hepatic encephalopathy (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.18, 2 trials, I2 = 79%). While there was no overall effect of the supplements on mortality in medical patients, the one low risk of bias trial found an increased risk of death in the recipients of the supplements. Three trials of supplements in surgical patients failed to show any significant differences. No new information was derived from the various subgroup or sensitivity analyses. The exploratory analyses were also unrevealing except for a logical conundrum. There was no difference in mortality when all of the trials were combined, but the trials of parenteral nutrition found that those recipients had better survival (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.98, 10 trials). Either the former observation represents a type II error or the latter one a type I error.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nAuthors' conclusions\n\nThe data do not compellingly justify the routine use of parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, or oral nutritional supplements in patients with liver disease. The fact that all but one of these trials were at high risks of bias even casts doubt on the few benefits that were demonstrated. Data from well-designed and executed randomised trials that include an untreated control group are needed before any such recommendation can be made. Future trials have to be powered adequately to see small, but clinically important, differences.",

		"abstract": "Background and Aim:  Hepatic encephalopathy continues to be a major clinical problem and the current decade has not witnessed major therapeutic breakthroughs in this area. l-ornithine-l-aspartate (LOLA) is not frequently used as there are still some reservations about its benefits. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of LOLA in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. Methods:  We used the method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of LOLA therapy for hepatic encephalopathy including three randomized controlled trials. Results:  Three randomized trials randomizing 212 patients were included. LOLA versus placebo had a significant effect on improvement of hepatic encephalopathy (relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.71; P = 0.0005). This comparison showed no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.85 and χ2 = 0.09). Subgroup analysis showed that LOLA could be effective versus placebo in trials with grade I or II overt hepatic encephalopathy patients (relative risk 1.87; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.68; P = 0.0007) and had no significant effect in trials with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy patients (relative risk 1.69; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.94; P = 0.23). Adverse effects were observed in only three patients treated with LOLA in one report. Conclusions:  LOLA benefited patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy (I or II), whereas these data do not support the use of LOLA for patients with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy.",

Eighty patients were randomized to two treatment groups, L-ornithine-L-aspartate (20 g/d) or placebo, both dissolved in 250 mL of 5% dextrose water and infused intravenously for four hours a day for five consecutive days with 0.5 g/kg dietary protein intake at the end of daily treatment period. Outcome variables were postprandial blood ammonia and mental state grade. Adverse reactions and mortality were also determined.\nRESULTS: Both treatment groups were comparable regarding age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh class, mental state grade and blood ammonia at baseline. Although, improvement occurred in both groups, there was a greater improvement in L-ornithine-L-aspartate group with regard to both variables. Four patients in the placebo group and 2 in L-ornithine-L-aspartate group died.\nCONCLUSION: L-ornithine-L-aspartate infusions were found to be effective in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy.",

		"abstract": "We studied the effect of glycine supplementation on lipid peroxidation and antioxidants in the erythrocyte membrane, plasma and hepatocytes of rats with alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity. Administering ethanol (20%) for 60 days to male Wistar rats resulted in significantly elevated levels of erythrocyte membrane, plasma and hepatocyte thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as compared with those of the experimental control rats. Decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) were also observed on alcohol supplementation as compared with those of the experimental control rats. Glycine was administered at a dose of 0.6 g kg−1 body weight to rats with alcohol-induced liver injury, which significantly decreased the levels of TBARS and significantly elevated the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx and GR in the erythrocyte membrane, plasma and hepatocytes as compared to that of untreated alcohol supplemented rats. Thus, our data indicate that supplementation with glycine offers protection against free radical-mediated oxidative stress in the erythrocyte membrane, plasma and hepatocytes of animals with alcohol-induced liver injury.

		"abstract": "Background\n\nChronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption decelerates the catabolism of long-lived proteins, indicating that it slows hepatic macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) a crucial lysosomal catabolic pathway in most eukaryotic cells. Autophagy and lysosome biogenesis are linked. Both are regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Here, we tested whether TFEB can be used as a singular indicator of autophagic activity, by quantifying its nuclear content in livers of mice subjected to acute and chronic EtOH administration. We correlated nuclear TFEB to specific indices of autophagy.\n\n\nMethods\n\nIn acute experiments, we gavaged GFP-LC3tg mice with a single dose of EtOH or with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We fed mice chronically by feeding them control or EtOH liquid diets.\n\n\nResults\n\nCompared with PBS-gavaged controls, livers of EtOH-gavaged mice exhibited greater autophagosome (AV) numbers, a higher incidence of AV-lysosome co-localization, and elevated levels of free GFP, all indicating enhanced autophagy, which correlated with a higher nuclear content of TFEB. Compared with pair-fed controls, livers of EtOH-fed mice exhibited higher AV numbers, but had lower lysosome numbers, lower AV-lysosome co-localization, higher P62/SQSTM1 levels, and lower free GFP levels. The latter findings correlated with lower nuclear TFEB levels in EtOH-fed mice. Thus, enhanced autophagy after acute EtOH gavage correlated with a higher nuclear TFEB content. Conversely, chronic EtOH feeding inhibited hepatic autophagy, associated with a lower nuclear TFEB content.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nOur findings suggest that the effect of acute EtOH gavage on hepatic autophagy differs significantly from that after chronic EtOH feeding. Each regimen distinctly affects TFEB localization, which in turn, regulates hepatic autophagy and lysosome biogenesis.",

Encephalopathy is defined when CFF <39 Hz. Nutritional status is measured by the mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) and is stated as malnutrition when MAMC <15%. All subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria received education for adequate calories and protein intake, and then they were be divided into 2 groups by randomization. One group was given LOLA granules 3 x 6 g/d for 2 weeks, while another group was not. Then their prealbumin and CFF test were measured again. Statistical analysis conducted for this double blind randomized clinical trial was independent student t test.\nRESULTS: there were 34 liver cirrhosis patients fit the inclusion criteria, and by randomization 17 subjects were put into group A (received LOLA) and 17 subjects into group B (without LOLA). Statistical analysis obtained the statistically significant (p=0,016) of increasing of the mean CFF value in group A (2.41 ± 1.6 Hz) compared to group B (0.67 ± 2.3 Hz). However, there was not significant increasing of prealbumin level in group A compared to group B (1 ± 1.3 mg/dL vs 1.2 ± 1.4 mg/dL, respectively (p=0,59). Furthermore, after 2 weeks of treatment there was no significant increase of ureum and creatinine level in both groups (4 ± 0.5 mg/dL vs 9.3 ± 1.3 mg/dL, (p=0.4) for ureum, -0.1 (0.1) mg/dL vs 0.1 ± 0.1 mg/dL, (p=0.3) for creatinine.\nCONCLUSION: minimal hepatic encephalopathy with malnutrition can be given a diet of 35-40 cal/kgBW and 1.5 g protein/kgBW including BCAA substitution to improve nutritional status, and LOLA granules can be given to improve encephalopathy.",

		"abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in brain sulfur-containing amino acid (SCAA) metabolism to determine whether taurine intervened under continuous alcohol intake. We fed 80 male Sprague–Dawley rats 30% alcohol-containing water for 4 weeks. Eighty animals were divided into two groups (with or without 2 g/kg body weight taurine supplementation), and five were killed every week in each group for monitoring SCAA changes in the brain, liver, kidneys and heart. Results indicated that the plasma alcohol concentration increased from Weeks 1–4; however, animals with taurine supplementation showed a lower plasma concentration of ethanol in Week 2. As to SCAA concentrations, cysteine and taurine were both lower after a week of alcohol ingestion in the brain and plasma; the same declining trend was shown in the liver in Week 2. In contrast, plasma and hepatic concentrations of homocysteine were elevated in Week 2, and the plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio also decreased in Week 1. Furthermore, the key cofactor of transsulfuration, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, significantly declined in the plasma after a week of the ethanol intervention, whereas an increase was observed in brain tissue. Under taurine supplementation, some recoveries were shown by delaying taurine depletion to Week 2, increasing the SAM/SAH ratio and elevating plasma and brain levels of vitamin B6 in Week 2. In conclusion, daily consumption of 30% alcohol interfered with SCAA metabolism, thus decreasing taurine's role in neurotransmission. The possible mechanism involved might be that ethanol interrupts the production of cysteine, which is the upstream SCAA of taurine, thus decreasing the homocysteine level. Additionally, taurine supplementation delayed this process.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol consumption is an integral part of daily life in many societies. The benefits associated with the production, sale, and use of alcoholic beverages come at an enormous cost to these societies. The World Health Organization ranks alcohol as one of the primary causes of the global burden of disease in industrialized countries. Alcohol-related diseases, especially alcoholism, are the result of cumulative responses to alcohol exposure, the genetic make-up of an individual, and the environmental perturbations over time. This complex gene × environment interaction, which has to be seen in a life-span perspective, leads to a large heterogeneity among alcohol-dependent patients, in terms of both the symptom dimensions and the severity of this disorder. Therefore, a reductionistic approach is not very practical if a better understanding of the pathological processes leading to an addictive behavior is to be achieved. Instead, a systems-oriented perspective in which the interactions and dynamics of all endogenous and environmental factors involved are centrally integrated, will lead to further progress in alcohol research. This review adheres to a systems biology perspective such that the interaction of alcohol with primary and secondary targets within the brain is described in relation to the behavioral consequences. As a result of the interaction of alcohol with these targets, alterations in gene expression and synaptic plasticity take place that lead to long-lasting alteration in neuronal network activity. As a subsequent consequence, alcohol-seeking responses ensue that can finally lead via complex environmental interactions to an addictive behavior.",

Since a proteomics analysis identified ASS and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) as co-induced in rat hepatocytes by chronic ethanol consumption, which also occurred in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in cirrhotic patients, we hypothesized that ASS could play a role in ethanol binge and chronic ethanol-induced liver damage.\n\nMethods\nTo investigate the contribution of ASS to the pathophysiology of ALD, wild-type (WT) and Ass+/− mice (Ass−/− are lethal due to hyperammonemia) were exposed to an ethanol binge or to chronic ethanol drinking.\n\nResults\nCompared with WT, Ass+/− mice given an ethanol binge exhibited decreased steatosis, lower NOS2 induction and less 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) protein residues, indicating that reducing nitrosative stress via the l-citrulline/NO· pathway plays a significant role in preventing liver damage. However, chronic ethanol treated Ass+/− mice displayed enhanced liver injury compared with WT mice. This was due to hyperammonemia, lower phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPKα) to total AMPKα ratio, decreased sirtuin (Sirt-1) and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (Pgc1α) mRNAs, lower fatty acid β-oxidation due to down-regulation of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-II (CPT-II), decreased antioxidant defense and elevated lipid peroxidation end-products in spite of comparable nitrosative stress but likely reduced NOS3.\n\nConclusion\nPartial Ass ablation protects only in acute ethanol-induced liver injury by decreasing nitrosative stress but not in a more chronic scenario where oxidative stress and impaired fatty acid β-oxidation are key events.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. currently, the most widely used model for alcoholic liver injury is ad libitum feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 4–6 weeks; however, this model, without the addition of a secondary insult, only induces mild steatosis, slight elevation of serum alanine transaminase (alt) and little or no inflammation. Here we describe a simple mouse model of alcoholic liver injury by chronic ethanol feeding (10-d ad libitum oral feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet) plus a single binge ethanol feeding. this protocol for chronic-plus-single-binge ethanol feeding synergistically induces liver injury, inflammation and fatty liver, which mimics acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver injury in patients. this feeding protocol can also be extended to chronic feeding for longer periods of time up to 8 weeks plus single or multiple binges. chronic-binge ethanol feeding leads to high blood alcohol levels; thus, this simple model will be very useful for the study of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and of other organs damaged by alcohol consumption.",

		"abstract": "Ethanol induces brain damage and neurodegeneration by triggering inflammatory processes in glial cells through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Recent evidence indicates the role of protein degradation pathways in neurodegeneration and alcoholic liver disease, but how these processes affect the brain remains elusive. We have demonstrated that chronic ethanol consumption impairs proteolytic pathways in mouse brain, and the immune response mediated by TLR4 receptors participates in these dysfunctions. We evaluate the in vitro effects of an acute ethanol dose on the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) on WT and TLR4-/- mouse astrocytes and neurons in primary culture, and how these changes affect cell survival. Our results show that ethanol induces overexpression of several autophagy markers (ATG12, LC3-II, CTSB), and increases the number of lysosomes in WT astrocytes, effects accompanied by a basification of lysosomal pH and by lowered phosphorylation levels of autophagy inhibitor mTOR, along with activation of complexes beclin-1 and ULK1. Notably, we found only minor changes between control and ethanol-treated TLR4-/- mouse astroglial cells. Ethanol also triggers the expression of the inflammatory mediators iNOS and COX-2, but induces astroglial death only slightly. Blocking autophagy by using specific inhibitors increases both inflammation and cell death. Conversely, in neurons, ethanol down-regulates the autophagy pathway and triggers cell death, which is partially recovered by using autophagy enhancers. These results support the protective role of the ALP against ethanol-induced astroglial cell damage in a TLR4-dependent manner, and provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced brain damage and are neuronal sensitive to the ethanol effects.",

The effects of ethanol on primary hepatocytes and hepatic cell lines were studied in vitro.\n\nResults\nEthanol-induced macroautophagy in the livers of mice and cultured cells required ethanol metabolism, generated reactive oxygen species, and inhibited mTOR signaling. Suppression of macroautophagy with pharmacological agents or small interfering RNAs significantly increased hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury; macroautophagy therefore protected cells from the toxic effects of ethanol. Macroautophagy induced by ethanol seemed to be selective for cells with damaged mitochondria and accumulated lipid droplets, but not long-lived proteins, which could account for its protective effects. Increasing macroautophagy pharmacologically reduced hepatotoxicity and steatosis associated with acute ethanol exposure.\n\nConclusions\nMacroautophagy protects against ethanol-induced toxicity in livers of mice. Reagents that modify macroautophagy might be developed as therapeutics for patients with alcoholic liver disease.",

		"abstract": "Drug- and alcohol-induced liver injury are a leading cause of liver failure and transplantation. Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a source of biomarkers because they contain unique proteins reflecting the identity and tissue-specific origin of the EV proteins. This study aimed to determine whether potentially hepatotoxic agents, such as acetaminophen (APAP) and binge alcohol, can increase the amounts of circulating EVs and evaluate liver-specific EV proteins as potential biomarkers for liver injury. The circulating EVs, isolated from plasma of APAP-exposed, ethanol-fed mice, or alcoholic hepatitis patients versus normal control counterparts, were characterized by proteomics and biochemical methods. Liver specific EV proteins were analyzed by immunoblots and ELISA. The amounts of total and liver-specific proteins in circulating EVs from APAP-treated mice significantly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis of EVs from APAP-exposed mice revealed that the amounts of liver-specific and/or hepatotoxic proteins were increased compared to those of controls. Additionally, the increased protein amounts in EVs following APAP exposure returned to basal levels when mice were treated with N-acetylcysteine or glutathione. Similar results of increased amounts and liver-specific proteins in circulating EVs were also observed in mice exposed to hepatotoxic doses of thioacetamide or d-galactosamine but not by non-hepatotoxic penicillin or myotoxic bupivacaine. Additionally, binge ethanol exposure significantly elevated liver-specific proteins in circulating EVs from mice and alcoholics with alcoholic hepatitis, compared to control counterparts. These results indicate that circulating EVs in drug- and alcohol-mediated hepatic injury contain liver-specific proteins that could serve as specific biomarkers for hepatotoxicity.",

The objective of the study was to analyze the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with heavy alcohol intake and the factors on which it depends. Included in the study were 103 hospitalized heavy drinkers (i.e., patients with an intake of alcohol greater than 80 g per day). Serum homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 levels, plasma vitamin B6 levels, and CT677 polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were determined. We also recorded the intensity of alcoholism, the status of nutrition, and the existence of liver cirrhosis. Determination of biochemical data was repeated after 15 days of withdrawal. Serum homocysteine levels were found to be significantly elevated, whereas serum folate and plasma B6 levels were significantly decreased. Serum homocysteine levels were significantly higher in those heavy drinkers who showed the TT polymorphism of MTHFR, with a prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia of 84.2% in the homozygote TT, 54.3% in the heterozygote CT, and 31.6% in the normal CC genotype. Serum homocysteine inversely correlated with serum folate, serum B12, and plasma B6 levels. We did not find any relation between serum homocysteine and intensity of alcoholism, nutritional status, or liver cirrhosis. Serum folate levels were significantly decreased in heavy drinkers, mainly depending on irregular feeding and malnutrition. After 15 days of withdrawal, serum homocysteine levels significantly decreased, whereas folate, B12, and B6 levels significantly increased. The conclusion is that heavy drinkers show a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia related to low levels of folate, B6, and B12 and to the TT polymorphism of MTHFR. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

		"abstract": "The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver disease is not well understood, and many factors have been described to contribute to the progressive loss of liver functions, including the overgeneration of reactive oxygen species. Mitochondria are specific targets of the toxic effects of ethanol, reflected in the loss of phosphorylative oxidation and defective ATP generation, which underlie one of the hallmarks of the hepatic alterations induced by chronic alcohol intake. Mitochondrial reduced glutathione (GSH), whose primary function is to maintain a competitive functional organelle, becomes depleted by alcohol intake. Furthermore, GSH depletion in hepatocyte mitochondria has been revealed as an important mechanism in the sensitization of liver to alcohol-induced injury. This depletion of the mitochondrial GSH level is determined by an impaired transport of GSH from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix owing to a partial inactivation of mitochondrial GSH carrier. The loss of function of this specific mitochondrial transporter is due to the alterations in the physicochemical properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane caused by alcohol. Because of the primary defect in the transport of cytosolic GSH into mitochondria, GSH precursors are inefficient in replenishing the levels of mitochondrial GSH despite significant increase in cytosolic GSH. Supplementation of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to rats fed alcohol chronically has been shown to replete the mitochondrial GSH levels because of normalization of the microviscosity of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Because of the instrumental role of GSH in mitochondria in hepatocyte survival against inflammatory cytokines, its repletion by SAM feeding may underlie the potential therapeutic use of this hepatoprotective agent in the treatment of alcohol-induced liver injury.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol-induced hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported in rats and humans. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to the activation of ER-dependent apoptosis or up-regulation of lipid synthesis. This novel ER stress mechanism of alcoholic liver injury was studied in the model of intragastric alcohol-fed mice. Effects of alcohol on gene expression were analyzed using cDNA microarrays, RT-PCR, and Western blots over a period of 6 weeks. Liver injury was examined by histologic staining and TUNEL. We observed fatty liver, increased hepatic necroinflammation and apoptosis, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Of 1176 toxicology-related genes, glucose-regulated proteins (GRP-78 and -94), growth arrest/DNAdamage-inducible protein 153 (CHOP/GADD153), and caspase-12 indicative of an ER stress response were among the alcohol-responsive genes. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1) and HMG-CoA reductase also were enhanced with alcohol administration. RT-PCR and selective Western blots confirmed the alcohol-induced expression of ER stress-related apoptosis and lipid synthesis genes. Addition of 0.5% and maximal 1.5% betaine to the alcohol diet reduced the elevated level of plasma homocysteine by 54% and more than 80% accompanied by a decrease in hepatic lipids and ER stress response. Betaine did not attenuate the ethanol-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor α or CD14 mRNA. The results strongly suggest that alcohol may modulate both apoptotic and fat synthetic gene expression through homocysteine-induced ER stress in chronic alcoholic mouse liver and that correction of hyperhomocysteinemia by betaine or other approaches may be useful to prevent alcoholic liver disease.",

The effect of alcohol on granule cell GABAAR inhibition was determined by a balance between two opposing effects: enhanced presynaptic vesicular release of GABA via alcohol inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and a direct suppression of the activity of postsynaptic GABAARs. The balance of these two processes was determined by differential expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and postsynaptic PKC activity, both of which varied across the rodent genotypes. These findings identify opposing molecular processes that differentially control the magnitude and polarity of GABAAR responses to alcohol across rodent genotypes.",

		"abstract": "We previously reported that chronic ethanol intake lowers hepatocellular S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio and significantly impairs many liver methylation reactions. One such reaction, catalyzed by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), is a major consumer of methyl groups and utilizes as much as 40% of the SAM-derived groups to convert guanidinoacetate (GAA) to creatine. The exposure to methyl-group consuming compounds has substantially increased over the past decade that puts additional stresses on the cellular methylation potential. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether increased ingestion of a methyl-group consumer (GAA) either alone or combined with ethanol intake, plays a role in the pathogenesis of liver injury. Adult male Wistar rats were pair-fed the Lieber DeCarli control or ethanol diet in the presence or absence of GAA for 2weeks. At the end of the feeding regimen, biochemical and histological analyses were conducted. We observed that 2weeks of GAA- or ethanol-alone treatment increases hepatic triglyceride accumulation by 4.5 and 7-fold, respectively as compared with the pair-fed controls. However, supplementing GAA in the ethanol diet produced panlobular macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis, a marked decrease in the methylation potential and a 28-fold increased triglyceride accumulation. These GAA-supplemented ethanol diet-fed rats displayed inflammatory changes and significantly increased liver toxicity compared to the other groups. In conclusion, increased methylation demand superimposed on chronic ethanol consumption causes more pronounced liver injury. Thus, alcoholic patients should be cautioned for increased dietary intake of methyl-group consuming compounds even for a short period of time.",

		"abstract": "Recent studies have suggested an association between alcoholism and DNA methylation, a mechanism that can mediate long-lasting changes in gene transcription. Here, we examined the contribution of DNA methylation to the long-term behavioral and molecular changes induced by a history of alcohol dependence. In search of mechanisms underlying persistent rather than acute dependence-induced neuroadaptations, we studied the role of DNA methylation regulating medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gene expression and alcohol-related behaviors in rats 3 weeks into abstinence following alcohol dependence. Postdependent rats showed escalated alcohol intake, which was associated with increased DNA methylation as well as decreased expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release in the mPFC. Infusion of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG108 prevented both escalation of alcohol consumption and dependence-induced downregulation of 4 of the 7 transcripts modified in postdependent rats. Specifically, RG108 treatment directly reversed both downregulation of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) gene expression and hypermethylation on CpG#5 of its first exon. Lentiviral inhibition of Syt2 expression in the mPFC increased aversion-resistant alcohol drinking, supporting a mechanistic role of Syt2 in compulsive-like behavior. Our findings identified a functional role of DNA methylation in alcohol dependence-like behavioral phenotypes and a candidate gene network that may mediate its effects. Together, these data provide novel evidence for DNA methyltransferases as potential therapeutic targets in alcoholism.",

		"abstract": "Background\nAlcoholics have been reported to have reduced levels of magnesium in both their extracellular and intracellular compartments. Calcium-dependent potassium channels (BK) are known to be one of ethanol’s (EtOH) better known molecular targets.\n\nMethods\nUsing outside-out patches from hippocampal neuronal cultures, we examine the consequences of altered intracellular Mg2+ on the effects that EtOH has on BK channels.\n\nResults\nWe find that the effect of EtOH is bi-modally influenced by the Mg2+ concentration on the cytoplasmic side. More specifically, when internal Mg2+ concentrations are ≤ 200 μM, EtOH decreases BK activity, whereas it increases activity when Mg2+ is at 1mM. Similar results are obtained when using patches from HEK cells expressing only the α-subunit of BK. When patches are made with the actin de-stabilizer cytochalasin D present on the cytoplasmic side, the potentiation caused by EtOH becomes independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Furthermore, in the presence of the actin stabilizer phalloidin, EtOH causes inhibition even at Mg2+ concentrations of 1mM.\n\nConclusions\nInternal Mg2+ can modulate the EtOH effects on BK channels only when there is an intact, internal actin interaction with the channel, as is found at synapses. We propose that the EtOH-induced decrease in cytoplasmic Mg2+ observed in frequent/chronic drinkers would decrease EtOH’s actions on synaptic (e.g. actin-bound) BK channels, producing a form of molecular tolerance.",

		"abstract": "Brain imaging technology has allowed researchers to conduct rigorous studies of the dynamic course of alcoholism through periods of drinking, sobriety, and relapse and to gain insights into the effects of chronic alcoholism on the human brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have distinguished alcohol-related brain effects that are permanent from those that are reversible with abstinence. In support of postmortem neuropathological studies showing degeneration of white matter, MRI studies have shown a specific vulnerability of white matter to chronic alcohol exposure. Such studies have demonstrated white-matter volume deficits as well as damage to selective gray-matter structures. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), by permitting microstructural characterization of white matter, has extended MRI findings in alcoholics. MR spectroscopy (MRS) allows quantification of several metabolites that shed light on brain biochemical alterations caused by alcoholism. This article focuses on MRI, DTI, and MRS findings in neurological disorders that commonly co-occur with alcoholism, including Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. Also reviewed are neuroimaging findings in animal models of alcoholism and related neurological disorders. This report also suggests that the dynamic course of alcoholism presents a unique opportunity to examine brain structural and functional repair and recovery.",

		"abstract": "Background:\nHomocysteine (Hcy) is formed as an intermediary in methionine metabolism. Impairment of Hcy remethylation or transulfuration leads to hyperhomocysteinemia, which is considered as a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease and stroke in chronic alcoholics. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic alcoholics and the influence of alcohol consumption, vitamin deficiencies and liver damage on the plasma levels of Hcy.\nMethods:\n228 chronic alcoholic patients consecutively admitted for detoxication, classified according to clinical and biochemical data in normal liver (n= 117), and in mild to moderate liver disease (n= 111), and 49 healthy controls were studied. Blood levels of Hcy, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate were measured.\nResults:\nPlasma Hcy was significantly higher in chronic alcoholics than in controls (9.66 ± 8.1 vs. 6.93 ± 2.33 μmol/liter, p < 0.025). Furthermore, plasma Hcy levels were significantly higher in chronic alcoholics with liver injury (12.17 ± 10.14 μmol/liter) than in those with normal liver and in controls (p < 0.001). The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was also significantly higher in alcoholics with liver damage than in those with normal liver and in controls (29.7%, 5.1%, and 2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Serum folate values were lower in chronic alcoholics than in controls (4.7 ± 2.6 vs. 7.6 ± 2.4 nmol/liter, p < 0.001). The lowest values of folate were found in alcoholics with liver disease, especially in those with hyperhomocysteinemia, with a negative correlation between the two parameters.\nConclusions:\nModerate hyperhomocysteinemia is common in chronic alcoholics, mainly in those with liver damage, suggesting that, although folate deficiencies may have a contributory role, liver impairment, through changes in methionine metabolism, is the most important mechanism for the elevated plasma Hcy found in these patients.",

		"abstract": "Chronic alcoholism is associated with increased cancer risk that may be related to ethanol-induced alterations in methionine and deoxynucleotide metabolism. These metabolic relationships were studied in micropigs fed diets for 12 months that contained 40% ethanol or cornstarch control with adequate folate. Ethanol feeding altered methionine metabolism without changing mean terminal liver folate levels. After initial equilibration to diet, ethanol feeding significantly increased monthly serum homocysteine levels while reducing serum methionine levels over the time course of the experiment. After 12 months, hepatic methionine synthase activity and the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were significantly reduced in ethanol-fed animals, whereas the ratio of liver deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) to deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) was increased and correlated inversely with methionine synthase activity. These findings were associated with increased frequency of hepatocytes with apoptotic bodies and positivity for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in livers from ethanol-fed minipigs. These studies suggest that chronic ethanol feeding perturbs methionine metabolism by impairment of methionine synthase activity, resulting in deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) imbalance, increased apoptosis, and regenerative proliferation. These biochemical alterations may provide a promoting environment for carcinogenesis during long-term ethanol exposure.",

		"abstract": "Background:  Chronic alcohol feeding induces hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Previously, we reported a protective role of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) in homocysteine-induced injury in cultured hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the direct role of BHMT in alcohol or homocysteine-induced liver injury. Methods:  Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase transgenic (Tg) mice were generated. Comparisons were made between the Tg and wild type (WT) mice in their response to intragastric alcohol infusion or to oral feeding of a high methionine low folate diet (HMLF). Results:  Expression of the Tg BHMT was increased in organs peripheral to the liver. The alcohol infusion for 4 weeks increased: plasma ALT by 5-fold in WT mice and 2.7-fold in Tg mice; plasma homocysteine by 7-fold in WT mice and 2-fold in Tg mice; liver triglycerides by 4-fold in WT mice and 2.5-fold in Tg mice. The alcohol-induced fatty liver was more severe in WT than in Tg mice based on H&E staining. The HMLF feeding for 4 weeks increased plasma ALT by 2-fold in WT mice and 1-fold in Tg mice; plasma homocysteine by 21-fold in WT mice and 3.3-fold in Tg mice; liver triglycerides by 2.5-fold in WT mice and 1.5-fold in Tg mice. HMLF induced accumulation of macro fat droplets in WT but not Tg mice. Betaine supplementation decreased partially the alcohol or HMLF-induced increase of ALT, homocysteine and liver lipids in WT mice. However, Tg mice were normal when fed both HMLF and betaine. In WT mice, both alcohol and HMLF induced moderate increase of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) protein which was partially reduced by betaine supplementation. In Tg mice, alcohol but not HMLF increased SREBP1. Carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein was increased by alcohol in either WT or Tg mice which was not affected by betaine supplementation. Ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was reduced by 50% in WT and by 20% in Tg mice fed alcohol. Ratio of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was reduced in WT but not Tg mice fed alcohol. Changes in PE methyltransferase activities were not detected in response to alcohol or HMLF feeding but were increased by betaine. Conclusions:  The BHMT Tg mice are resistant to alcohol or HMLF-induced HHcy and liver steatosis indicating that peripheral metabolism of homocysteine protected the liver without a direct effect of BHMT in the liver. Multiple mechanisms are involved in protection by betaine including increased SAM/SAH and PC/PE ratios.",

		"abstract": "Abstract:  Background:  Abnormal methionine metabolism occurs in animals fed ethanol and in end-stage cirrhotic patients. Expected consequences of these abnormalities include reduced hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and glutathione (GSH) levels, impaired transmethylation, and reduced homocysteine catabolism, resulting in the often-observed hyperhomocystinemia in cirrhotic patients. These parameters have not been examined simultaneously in patients with less advanced alcoholic liver disease. Methods:  Six patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis were studied. Plasma was analyzed for homocysteine, methionine, and GSH levels. Liver biopsies diagnosed acute alcoholic hepatitis and underlying fibrosis. Liver specimens were processed for messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and various metabolites and were compared with those of six normal controls. Results:  Three patients had cirrhosis, and three had only portal fibrosis. Plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine were increased in two of the three patients with cirrhosis but not in the patients with fibrosis. All patients had markedly lower plasma GSH levels (mean ± SD: 0.27 ± 0.19 μM, which is at least 10-fold lower than the normal range). Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine levels were reduced by 50%, whereas methionine, GSH, and cysteine levels were reduced by 70–80%. The mRNA levels of most enzymes involved in methionine metabolism and GSH synthesis were decreased, whereas albumin expression was unchanged. Despite the well known induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 in chronic alcoholics, its mRNA levels were nearly 70% lower in these patients. Conclusions:  In alcoholic hepatitis, abnormal hepatic gene expression in methionine and GSH metabolism occurs and often contributes to decreased hepatic methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and GSH levels. It may be important to replenish these thiols in patients hospitalized with alcoholic hepatitis.",

		"abstract": "It has been claimed that oral creatine supplementation might have potential cytotoxic effects on healthy consumers by increasing the production of methylamine and formaldehyde. Despite this allegation, there has been no scientific evidence obtained in humans to sustain or disprove such a detrimental effect of this widely used ergogenic substance. Twenty young healthy men ingested 21 g of creatine monohydrate daily for 14 consecutive days. Venous blood samples and 24-h urine were collected before and after the 14th day of supplementation. Creatine and creatinine were analyzed in plasma and urine, and methylamine, formaldehyde, and formate were determined in 24-h urine samples. Oral creatine supplementation increased plasma creatine content 7.2-fold (P < 0.001) and urine output 141-fold (P < 0.001) with no effect on creatinine levels. Twenty-four-hour urine excretion of methylamine and formaldehyde increased, respectively, 9.2-fold (P = 0.001) and 4.5-fold (P = 0.002) after creatine feeding, with no increase in urinary albumin output (9.78 +/- 1.93 mg x 24 h(-1) before, 6.97 +/- 1.15 mg x 24 h(-1) creatine feeding). This investigation shows that short-term, high-dose oral creatine supplementation enhances the excretion of potential cytotoxic compounds, but does not have any detrimental effects on kidney permeability. This provides indirect evidence of the absence of microangiopathy in renal glomeruli.",

		"abstract": "Two of the most important biochemical hepatic pathways in the liver are those that synthesize methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) through the methylation of homocysteine. This article reviews some recent findings in this laboratory, which demonstrate that ethanol feeding to rats impairs one of these pathways involving the enzyme methionine synthetase (MS), but by way of compensation increases the activity of the enzyme betaine:homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT), which catalyzes the second pathway in methionine and SAM biosynthesis. It has been shown that despite the inhibition of MS, the enhanced BHMT pathway utilizes hepatic betaine pools to maintain levels of SAM. Subsequent to the above findings, it has been shown that minimal supplemental dietary betaine at the 0.5% level generates SAM twofold in control animals and fivefold in ethanol-fed rats. Concomitant with the betaine-generated SAM, ethanol-induced hepatic fatty infiltration was ameliorated. In view of the fact that SAM has already been used successfully in the treatment of human maladies, including liver dysfunction, betaine, shown to protect against the early stages of alcoholic liver injury as well as being a SAM generator, may become a promising therapeutic agent and a possible alternative to expensive SAM in the treatment of liver disease and other human maladies.",

		"abstract": "Among the most important pathways for liver integrity in the body are the two that synthesize methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) through methylation of homocysteine. Results of studies in this laboratory have demonstrated ethanolic inhibition of one of these pathways catalyzed by methionine synthetase. It has been shown elsewhere that alcohol per se does not inhibit the enzyme, but that the metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, is responsible through the formation of an inhibiting covalent adduct. Because hepatic SAM has been shown to be essential in the transport of fat from the liver, avoiding steatosis and further liver damage, it is entirely feasible that this repression of methionine synthase is an important site of the injurious action of alcohol metabolism in the liver. This loss of activity is particularly important in human beings who cannot produce methionine and SAM by means of the alternate pathway mediated by betaine:homocysteine:transmethylase, because of the lack of production of the betaine substrate for this enzyme.",

Although binding will include sequestration by intracellular organelles, a large part of the binding is by ATP in the cytosol and an equilibrium exists in the cytosol between free ATP, ionized magnesium and Mg-ATP. The extend of this equilibrium depends on the equilibrium constant of the reaction, which is a function of pH, temperature and ionic strength. This equilibrium constant is also important in the estimation of [Mg2+]i using 31P-NMR. In this method the difference between the α and β peaks of ATP is measured and from this shift and the equilibrium constant between Mg2+ and ATP in the cytosol, the [Mg2+]i can be calculated (Vink, 1993).",

		"abstract": "Hypomagnesemia is positively correlated with a number of cardiovascular abnormalities and recent evidence suggests that magnesium supplementation prevents ethanol-induced development of hypertension. The purpose of our study was to assess whether dietary magnesium supplementation effectively reverses or attenuates chronic ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction, both at the tissue and the cellular level. Therefore, the influence of dietary magnesium supplementation during chronic ethanol ingestion on the mechanical properties of cardiac muscle was studied using isolated papillary muscles and ventricular myocytes from rat heart. In addition, the acute effects of ethanol on cardiac muscle from animals chronically exposed to ethanol in the absence and presence of dietary magnesium supplementation were also examined. Chronic ethanol exposure caused significant cardiac, hepatic, and renal enlargement, increased systolic blood pressure, and produced hypomagnesemia. After chronic ethanol exposure, the baseline force generating capacity of papillary muscles was markedly depressed and was associated with a significant slowing in the maximum velocities of contraction and relaxation. By contrast, in isolated myocytes, long-term ethanol exposure increased the extent of cell shortening associated with a significant reduction in the duration of relengthening and an increase in both the maximum velocities of shortening and relengthening. Dietary magnesium supplementation among animals chronically ingesting ethanol effectively normalized heart size, systolic blood pressure, and reduced plasma ethanol concentration. Magnesium supplementation also attenuated chronic ethanol-induced depression of contractile force and increased the extent of cell shortening. As expected, acute ethanol exposure caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both isometric force and isotonic shortening associated with a decrease in the intracellular calcium transient. However, the extent of the acute ethanol-induced reduction in isometric force and isotonic shortening was always slightly greater among preparations from animals chronically exposed to ethanol. Dietary magnesium supplementation normalized the acute inhibitory action of ethanol on isometric force, isotonic shortening, and the intracellular calcium transient. Our results suggest that dietary magnesium supplementation may attenuate chronic ethanol-induced alterations in baseline myocardial mechanical function and normalize the cardiac response to acute ethanol exposure.",

		"abstract": "The acute administration of a first dose of ethanol (EtOH) to rat liver cells reduces the amount of Mg2+ extruded by a second dose of EtOH or the subsequent addition of adrenergic agonists. In contrast, the Mg2+ extrusion normally elicited by the α1-adrenergic or β-adrenergic agonist does not impair the Mg2+ mobilization induced by the subsequent addition of EtOH. Inhibition of EtOH metabolism by 4-methylpyrazole abolishes almost completely the Mg2+ extrusion induced by the first dose of EtOH, and partially enlarges that elicited by the second dose of alcohol or the subsequent adrenergic stimulation. Ethanol-treated liver cells stimulated by the adrenergic agonist show a reduced level of membrane-bound Gαs as well as a reduced cellular cAMP content. Analysis of cellular Mg2+ distribution indicates that EtOH administration decreases the Mg2+ content of the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum to a comparable extent. These data indicate that acute EtOH administration directly impairs cellular Mg2+ homeostasis and also prevents a further Mg2+ mobilization by additional doses of alcohol or α1-adrenoceptor and β-adrenoceptor agonist by decreasing cytosolic and intraorganelle Mg2+ content and by affecting G-protein membrane distribution/signaling.",

		"abstract": "Acute and chronic ethanol administration results in a decrease in cellular Mg2+ content and an alteration of Mg2+ transport in liver cells. In this study we investigated the extent to which ethanol affects the Mg2+ transport mechanisms in the liver cell membrane. The functionality of these transport mechanisms was assessed in plasma membrane vesicles purified from livers acutely perfused with varying concentrations of alcohol, livers of animals fed with 6% ethanol for 3 weeks, and the respective controls. Acute alcohol administration had little or no effect on the Mg2+ extrusion mechanisms present in the apical and basolateral domains of the hepatocyte but completely impaired the Mg2+ entry mechanism present in the basolateral side of the cell. This effect was already evident at a dose of alcohol as small as 0.01% (~1.5mM). The chronic administration of ethanol, instead, impaired all the Mg2+ transport mechanisms irrespective of the location and directionality in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate a selective sensitivity of the Mg2+ entry mechanism to acute alcohol administration, whereas the Mg2+ extrusion mechanisms are affected only after prolonged exposure to alcohol. These results suggest that the defect in hormone-activated Mg2+ transport observed in the chronic EtOH model [Young, A., Cefaratti, C., & Romani, A. (2003). Chronic EtOH administration alters liver Mg2+ homeostasis. Am J Physiol 284, G57–G67] depends not only on a reduced cellular Mg2+ content but also on the impaired Mg2+ transport mechanisms present in the hepatocyte plasma membrane, in particular the Mg2+ entry pathway, which prevents the liver cell from restoring cellular Mg2+ homeostasis.",

		"abstract": "This study was designed to examine the roles of intracellular free magnesium ion concentration ([Mg2+]i) in ethanol-induced intoxication and development of tolerance in cultured canine cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells and astrocytes as well as intact rat brain. The basal, resting level of [Mg2+]i in cerebrovascular cells was 732.5 ± 82.4 μM. Exposure of cultured canine cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells to ethanol (10 and 25 mM) for 24 h reduced the concentrations of [Mg2+]i to 521.1 ± 59.6 μM, and 308.2 ± 37.8μM, respectively. However, exposure of these cultured vascular cells to the same concentrations of ethanol, after initial pretreatment with ethanol for 24 h, failed to interfere with the levels of [Mg2+]i. Measurement of [Mg2+]i at 48 h and 72 h indicated that the decreased levels of [Mg2+]i induced by ethanol at 24 h treatment returned toward baseline. Similar experiments were performed in cultured type-2 astrocytes isolated from neonatal rat brain. The basal level of [Mg2+]i in type-2 astrocytes was about 125 μM. Incubation of these cells with 10 mM ethanol for 10 min resulted in a 27% reduction in the level of [Mg2+]i, whereas incubation with 25 mM ethanol resulted in almost a 50% reduction in [Mg2+]i. The decreased levels of [Mg2+]i lasted around 30 min, until the measurement finished. Continuous incubation of these cultured astrocytes, with ethanol (either 10 mM or 25 mM), for more than 24 h, indicated that the concentrations of [Mg2+]i in type-2 astrocytes were equivalent to those at basal, resting levels. In vivo 31P-NMR spectroscopy, performed on intact rat brains, indicated that an initial administration of 4 mg/kg ethanol (∼20–25 mM blood alcohol level) resulted (after 20–40 min of exposure) in severe deficits in whole brain [Mg2+]i (550 ± 33 μM to 358 ± 24 μM). Repeated injections of ethanol (4 mg/kg) over the next 24–72 h resulted in progressively diminishing effects on brain [Mg2+]i. These experimental data indicate that chronic ethanol treatment can induce a tolerance to depletion of [Mg2+]i in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, type-2 astrocytes as well as intact rat brain. The results suggest that [Mg2+]i might play a major role in alcohol-induced tolerance in the brain.",

After precontraction of arterial ring segments with ethanol, PDTC (10−8–10−6 M) and Vit. E (10−6–10−4 M) induced concentration-dependent relaxations of cerebral arteries, compared to untreated controls. The effective concentrations producing approximately 50% of the maximal relaxation responses (EC50 values) were about 2.48±0.09 × 10−7 M for PDTC, and 1.87±0.10 × 10−5 mM for Vit. E, respectively. Preincubation of these arterial rings with EC50’s of PDTC or Vit. E for 40 min attenuate markedly the contractions produced by alcohol, at concentrations of 1–400 mM. However, both PDTC and Vit.E do not relax equi-potent precontractions induced by either KCl or prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) or inhibit their contractions. These data suggest that alcohol-induced contractions of cerebral arteries are mediated via excitation-contraction coupling pathways different from those used by KCl or receptor-mediated agonists such as PGF2α. The present results, when viewed in light of other recently published data, suggest that antioxidants may prove useful in the amelioration and treatment of alcohol-induced brain damage and strokes.",

Treatment of the cultured cells with either PDTC (0.1 μM) or α-tocopherol (15 μM) for 24 h, alone, failed to interfere with basal [Mg2+]i levels. However, preincubation of the cells with either α-tocopherol or PDTC for 24 h completely inhibited the depletion of [Mg2+]i induced by exposure to 10–100 mM ethanol. These results indicate that α-tocopherol and PDTC prevent decreases in [Mg2+]i produced by ethanol. Moreover, these new results suggest that such protective effects of α-tocopherol and PDTC on cerebral vascular cells might be useful therapeutic tools in prevention and amelioration of cerebral vascular injury and stroke in alcoholics.",

Upregulation of these transcriptional factors was inversely proportional to the [Mg2+]o and occurred over the pathophysiologic range of serum Mg2+ found in patients presenting with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), use of nifedipine or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the upregulation of the proto-oncogenes and DNA synthesis in VSMCs. These data show that [Mg2+]o may be an important, heretofore, overlooked natural modulator of proto-oncogene and NF-κB expression in VSMCs and that Ca2+ and PKC may play critical roles in induction of c-fos and c-jun in VSMCs induced by a decrease in [Mg2+]o. These results point to a role for low serum Mg2+ in potential development of hypertension, atherogenesis, vascular disease, and stroke.",

		"abstract": "Experiments were performed to address some outstanding issues and investigate possible mechanisms relating to the acute comparative effects of ethanol on liver and skeletal muscle protein metabolism. Ethanol (EtOH)-treated rats were injected (i.p.) with a bolus of EtOH (75 mmol/kg body weight) and sacrificed at 20 min, 1-, 2.5-, 6-, and 24-hr time points. Control rats were injected with saline (Con-Sal; 0.15 mmol/L NaCl). All 24-hr ethanol-treated animals were compared with saline-injected rats subjected to controlled feeding (i.e. pair-fed controls for 24 hr EtOH). At 24 hr, there was no measurable alcohol in the plasma, whereas high levels were seen from 20 min to 6 hr (up to 448 mg/dL). Plasma levels of albumin were reduced at initial time points, and activities of aspartate aminotransferase increased, but there was no histological evidence of overt tissue damage either in muscle or liver. Hepatic protein and RNA contents and indices of tissue (Cs and ks) and whole-body (Vs) protein synthesis were significantly increased in ethanol-dosed rats relative to saline-injected pair-fed controls at 24 hr. In the liver, four of the seven cytoplasmic proteases investigated (alanyl-, arginyl-, and pyroglutamyl-aminopeptidases and proline-endopeptidase) showed significant increases in activity at 24 hr relative to pair-fed controls; four of the six lysosomal proteases showed significant decreases in activity (dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase II and cathepsins B, L, and H). In skeletal muscle, ks fell progressively between 1 and 24 hr (−25 to −69%; P < 0.001), but no significant changes in skeletal muscle protease activities were seen at 24 hr. At 24 hr after ethanol dosage in vivo, there were no significant increases in protein carbonyl content in liver or skeletal muscle compared to pair-fed controls (muscle levels actually decreased slightly). However, using either rat or human tissue, both liver and muscle carbonyl increased in vitro in response to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals: muscle was more susceptible to carbonyl formation than liver and both tissues were more sensitive to hydroxyl compared to superoxide radicals. These results show divergent effects of acute ethanol treatment on liver and skeletal muscle protein metabolism, which may not be linked to in vivo free radical-mediated protein damage (as indicated by carbonyl formation), at least in the short term.",

		"abstract": "Alcohol can be considered as a nutritional toxin when ingested in excess amounts and leads to skeletal muscle myopathy. We hypothesized that altered protease activities contribute to this phenomenon, and that differential effects on protease activities may occur when: (1) rats at different stages in their development are administered alcohol in vivo; (2) acute ethanol treatment is superimposed on chronic alcohol-feeding in vivo; and (3) muscles are exposed to alcohol and acetaldehyde in vivo and in vitro. In acute studies, rats weighing approximately 0.1 kg (designated immature) or approximately 0.25 kg (designated mature) body weight (BW) were dosed acutely with alcohol (75 mmol/kg BW; intraperitoneal [IP], 2.5 hours prior to killing) or identically treated with 0.15 mol/L NaCl as controls. In chronic studies, rats (approximately 0.1 kg BW) were fed between 1 to 6 weeks, with 35% of dietary energy as ethanol, controls were identically treated with isocaloric glucose. Other studies included administration of cyanamide (aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) in vivo or addition of alcohol and acetaldehyde to muscle preparations in vitro. At the end of the treatments, cytoplasmic (alanyl-, arginyl-, leucyl-, prolyl-, tripeptidyl-aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV), lysosomal (cathepsins B, D, H, and L, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I and II), proteasomal (chymotrypsin-, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase activities) and Ca2+-activated (micro- and milli-calpain and calpastatin) activities were assayed. (1) Acute alcohol dosage in mature rats reduced the activities of alanyl-, arginyl- and leucyl aminopeptidase (cytoplasmic), dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II (lysosomal), and the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities (proteosomal). No significant effects were observed in similarly treated immature rats. (2) Alcohol feeding in immature rats did not alter the activities of any of the enzymes assayed at 6 weeks. (3) In immature rats, activities of cathepsins B and D were not overtly affected at either 3, 7, 14, 28, or 42 days. (4) Superimposing acute (2.5 hours) on chronic (4 weeks feeding of immature rats) ethanol treatment (ie, chronic + acute) reduced the activities of cytoplasmic proline aminopeptidase and the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome. (5) Cathepsin D activities were reduced in muscle homogenates upon addition of alcohol and acetaldehyde in vitro. (6) Cyanamide pretreatment in combination with alcohol dosage in immature rats did not significantly alter any protease activities. The data suggests that mature rats are more sensitive to the effects of acute alcohol on muscle proteases. Protease activities may be affected by acetaldehyde or alcohol levels as indicated by in vitro experiments. The reduction in muscle protease activities in chronic + acute alcohol superimposition may reflect the effect of acute alcohol dosage alone. Overall, there was no evidence for increased protease activity in any of the experimental situations.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarize experimental findings showing that magnesium modulates cellular events involved in inflammation. Experimental magnesium deficiency in the rat induces after a few days a clinical inflammatory syndrome characterized by leukocyte and macrophage activation, release of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, excessive production of free radicals. Increase in extracellular magnesium concentration, decreases inflammatory response while reduction in the extracellular magnesium results in cell activation. Because magnesium acts as a natural calcium antagonist, the molecular basis for inflammatory response is probably the result of modulation of intracellular calcium concentration. The priming of phagocytic cells, the opening calcium channel and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) have been considered as potential mechanisms. Moreover, magnesium deficiency induces a systemic stress response by activation of neuro endocrinological pathways. As nervous and immune systems interact bidirectionally, the roles of neuromediators have also been considered. Magnesium deficiency contributes to an exaggerated response to immune stress and oxidative stress is the consequence of the inflammatory response. Inflammation contributes to the pro-atherogenic changes in lipoprotein metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, hypertension and explains the aggravating effect of magnesium deficiency on the development of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are still needed to assess more accurately the role of magnesium in immune response in humans, but these experimental findings in animal models suggest that inflammation is the missing link to explain the role of magnesium in many pathological conditions.",

		"abstract": "Intelligent animals devote much time and energy to exploring and obtaining information, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We review recent developments on this topic that have emerged from the traditionally separate fields of machine learning, eye movements in natural behavior, and studies of curiosity in psychology and neuroscience. These studies show that exploration may be guided by a family of mechanisms that range from automatic biases toward novelty or surprise to systematic searches for learning progress and information gain in curiosity-driven behavior. In addition, eye movements reflect visual information searching in multiple conditions and are amenable for cellular-level investigations. This suggests that the oculomotor system is an excellent model system for understanding information-sampling mechanisms.",

		"abstract": "Saccadic (rapid) eye movements are primary means by which humans and non-human primates sample visual information. However, while saccadic decisions are intensively investigated in instrumental contexts where saccades guide subsequent actions, it is largely unknown how they may be influenced by curiosity – the intrinsic desire to learn. While saccades are sensitive to visual novelty and visual surprise, no study has examined their relation to epistemic curiosity – interest in symbolic, semantic information. To investigate this question, we tracked the eye movements of human observers while they read trivia questions and, after a brief delay, were visually given the answer. We show that higher curiosity was associated with earlier anticipatory orienting of gaze toward the answer location without changes in other metrics of saccades or fixations, and that these influences were distinct from those produced by variations in confidence and surprise. Across subjects, the enhancement of anticipatory gaze was correlated with measures of trait curiosity from personality questionnaires. Finally, a machine learning algorithm could predict curiosity in a cross-subject manner, relying primarily on statistical features of the gaze position before the answer onset and independently of covariations in confidence or surprise, suggesting potential practical applications for educational technologies, recommender systems and research in cognitive sciences. With this article, we provide full access to the annotated database allowing readers to reproduce the results. Epistemic curiosity produces specific effects on oculomotor anticipation that can be used to read out curiosity states.",

Cenicriviroc exposures were increased by moderate HI (AUC0-τ 55%, Cmax 29% higher) but were not with mild HI (AUC0-τ 38%, Cmax 40% lower). Cenicriviroc was well tolerated. Rapid and potent CCR2/CCR5 blockade was observed, not associated with increases in hepatic inflammation or bacterial translocation biomarkers.

		"abstract": "The control and maintenance of the intracellular redox state is an essential task for cells and organisms. NAD+ and NADH constitute a redox pair crucially involved in cellular metabolism as a cofactor for many dehydrogenases. In addition, NAD+ is used as a substrate independent of its redox-carrier function by enzymes like poly(ADP)ribose polymerases, sirtuins and glycohydrolases like CD38. The activity of these enzymes affects the intracellular pool of NAD+ and depends in turn on the availability of NAD+. In addition, both NAD+ and NADH as well as the NAD+/NADH redox ratio can modulate gene expression and Ca2+ signals. Therefore, the NAD+/NADH redox state constitutes an important metabolic node involved in the control of many cellular events ranging from the regulation of metabolic fluxes to cell fate decisions and the control of cell death. This review summarizes the different functions of NAD+ and NADH with a focus on astrocytes, a pivotal glial cell type contributing to brain metabolism and signaling.",

		"abstract": "Adult neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons throughout life in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of most mammalian species, which is closely related to aging and disease. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), also an adipokine known as visfatin, is the rate-limiting enzyme for mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) salvage synthesis by generating nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from nicotinamide. Recent findings from our laboratory and other laboratories have provided much evidence that NAMPT might serve as a therapeutic target to restore adult neurogenesis. NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis in neural stem/progenitor cells is important for their proliferation, self-renewal, and formation of oligodendrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Therapeutic interventions by the administration of NMN, NAD, or recombinant NAMPT are effective for restoring adult neurogenesis in several neurological diseases. We summarize adult neurogenesis in aging, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disease and review the advances of targeting NAMPT in restoring neurogenesis. Specifically, we provide emphasis on the P7C3 family, a class of proneurogenic compounds that are potential NAMPT activators, which might shed light on future drug development in neurogenesis restoration.",

		"abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction is linked to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases including heart failure but the specific mechanisms for this link remain largely elusive. We modeled the impairment of mitochondrial respiration by inactivation of the Ndufs4 gene, a protein critical for Complex I (C-I) assembly, in the mouse heart (cKO). While C-I supported respiration decreased by >40%, the cKO mice maintained normal cardiac function in vivo and high-energy phosphate content in isolated perfused hearts. However, the cKO mice developed accelerated heart failure after pressure overload or repeated pregnancy. Decreased NAD+/NADH ratio by C-I deficiency inhibited Sirt3 activity, leading to increase in protein acetylation, and sensitization of the permeability transition in mitochondria (mPTP). NAD+ precursor supplementation to cKO mice partially normalized the NAD+/NADH ratio, protein acetylation and mPTP sensitivity. These findings describe a mechanism connecting mitochondrial dysfunction to the susceptibility to diseases and propose a potential therapeutic target.",

		"abstract": "The original concept of the NAD World was proposed in 2009, providing a comprehensive framework to investigate critical issues of biological robustness and trade-offs in mammalian aging and longevity control. Significant progress has been made over the past 7 years, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which biological robustness is maintained, and providing extensive support to the concept of the NAD World. Three key organs and tissues have been identified as basic elements in this control system for mammalian aging and longevity: the hypothalamus as the control center of aging, skeletal muscle as an effector, and adipose tissue as a modulator. While the hypothalamus sends a signal to skeletal muscle through the sympathetic nervous system, adipose tissue remotely regulates hypothalamic function by coordinating NAD+ biosynthesis at a systemic level. Skeletal muscle might also communicate with other organs and tissues by secreting various myokines. The mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 and the key NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NAMPT mediate these inter-tissue communications. In this review, the function of each organ or tissue and their inter-tissue communications will be discussed in terms of understanding mammalian aging and longevity control. With such an emphasis on the system architecture, the concept is now reformulated as the NAD World 2.0, providing several important predictions. The concept of the NAD World 2.0 will provide a new foundation to understand a control system for mammalian aging and longevity and accelerate the development of an effective anti-aging intervention for humans.",

		"abstract": "Excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) is strongly associated with mitochondrial and cellular oxidative damage, aging, and degenerative diseases. However, mROS also induces pathways of protection of mitochondria that slow aging, inhibit cell death, and increase lifespan. Recent studies show that the activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is triggered by mROS and mitochondrial calcium overloading, is enhanced in aged animals and humans and in aging‐related degenerative diseases. mPTP opening initiates further production and release of mROS that damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, proteins, and phospholipids, and also releases matrix NAD that is hydrolyzed in the intermembrane space, thus contributing to the depletion of cellular NAD that accelerates aging. Oxidative damage to calcium transporters leads to calcium overload and more frequent opening of mPTP. Because aging enhances the opening of the mPTP and mPTP opening accelerates aging, we suggest that mPTP opening drives the progression of aging. Activation of the mPTP is regulated, directly and indirectly, not only by the mitochondrial protection pathways that are induced by mROS, but also by pro‐apoptotic signals that are induced by DNA damage. We suggest that the integration of these contrasting signals by the mPTP largely determines the rate of cell aging and the initiation of cell death, and thus animal lifespan. The suggestion that the control of mPTP activation is critical for the progression of aging can explain the conflicting and confusing evidence regarding the beneficial and deleterious effects of mROS on health and lifespan.",

		"abstract": "Aging science has recently drawn much attention, and discussions on the possibility of anti-aging medicine have multiplied. One potential target for the development of anti-aging drugs is the SIR2 (silent information regulator 2) family of NAD-dependent deacetylases/ADP-ribosyltransferases, called “sirtuins.” Sirtuins regulate many fundamental biological processes in response to a variety of environmental and nutritional stimuli. In mammals, the mammalian SIR2 ortholog SIRT1 has been most studied, and small molecule SIRT1 activators (STACs), including a plant-derived polyphenolic compound resveratrol, have been developed. On the other hand, sirtuin activity is regulated by NAD biosynthetic pathways, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) plays a critical role in the regulation of mammalian sirtuin activity. Recent studies have provided a proof of concept for the idea that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the NAMPT reaction product, can be used a nutriceutical to activate SIRT1 activity. Based on these recent findings, the possibility of sirtuin-targeted nutriceutical development will be discussed.",

		"abstract": "The workshop entitled ‘Interventions to Slow Aging in Humans: Are We Ready?’ was held in Erice, Italy, on October 8–13, 2013, to bring together leading experts in the biology and genetics of aging and obtain a consensus related to the discovery and development of safe interventions to slow aging and increase healthy lifespan in humans. There was consensus that there is sufficient evidence that aging interventions will delay and prevent disease onset for many chronic conditions of adult and old age. Essential pathways have been identified, and behavioral, dietary, and pharmacologic approaches have emerged. Although many gene targets and drugs were discussed and there was not complete consensus about all interventions, the participants selected a subset of the most promising strategies that could be tested in humans for their effects on healthspan. These were: (i) dietary interventions mimicking chronic dietary restriction (periodic fasting mimicking diets, protein restriction, etc.); (ii) drugs that inhibit the growth hormone/IGF-I axis; (iii) drugs that inhibit the mTOR–S6K pathway; or (iv) drugs that activate AMPK or specific sirtuins. These choices were based in part on consistent evidence for the pro-longevity effects and ability of these interventions to prevent or delay multiple age-related diseases and improve healthspan in simple model organisms and rodents and their potential to be safe and effective in extending human healthspan. The authors of this manuscript were speakers and discussants invited to the workshop. The following summary highlights the major points addressed and the conclusions of the meeting.",

Using insights derived from simple model organisms, mice, and humans we discuss how these proteins and pathways may potentially alter the rate of aging.

Sirtuins have recently attracted major attention in the field of aging research, and it has been demonstrated that SIR2 and its orthologs regulate aging and longevity in yeast, worms, and flies. In mammals, the SIR2 ortholog SIRT1 coordinates important metabolic responses to nutritional availability in multiple tissues. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that SIRT1 regulates the amplitude and the duration of circadian gene expression through the interaction and the deacetylation of key circadian clock regulators, such as BMAL1 and PER2. More strikingly, we and others have discovered a novel circadian clock feedback loop in which both the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD biosynthesis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and NAD levels display circadian oscillations and modulate CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated circadian transcriptional regulation through SIRT1, demonstrating a new function of NAD as a “metabolic oscillator.” These findings reveal a novel system dynamics of a recently proposed systemic regulatory network regulated by NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis and SIRT1, namely, the NAD World.

		"abstract": "The circadian system of mammals is composed of a hierarchy of oscillators that function at the cellular, tissue, and systems levels. A common molecular mechanism underlies the cell-autonomous circadian oscillator throughout the body, yet this clock system is adapted to different functional contexts. In the central suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a coupled population of neuronal circadian oscillators acts as a master pacemaker for the organism to drive rhythms in activity and rest, feeding, body temperature, and hormones. Coupling within the SCN network confers robustness to the SCN pacemaker, which in turn provides stability to the overall temporal architecture of the organism. Throughout the majority of the cells in the body, cell-autonomous circadian clocks are intimately enmeshed within metabolic pathways. Thus, an emerging view for the adaptive significance of circadian clocks is their fundamental role in orchestrating metabolism.",

		"abstract": "The recent research on ageing processes in mammals throws new light on the biochemistry of circadian clock. The already known regulatory pathways for biological rhythms and metabolism, combined with newly discovered functions of sirtuins, unveil a perspective for new hypotheses, regarding possible links between ageing and circadian rhythms. The NAD World hypothesis – postulated as a systemic regulatory network for the metabolism and ageing, linked with mammalian, NAD+ dependent Sirtuin 1 – conceptually involves two critical elements. One is the systemic, Nampt-controlled NAD+ (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) biosynthesis, where Nampt (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) acts as “propulsion” for metabolism and the other is NAD+ dependent deacetylase (SIRT1) — a regulator responsible for various biological effects, depending on its localisation in organism. In this approach, the role of sirtuins, which are evolutionary conservative, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases, may be very important for the mammalian metabolic clock.

		"abstract": "Environmental temperature cycles are a universal entraining cue for all circadian systems at the organismal level with the exception of homeothermic vertebrates. We report here that resistance to temperature entrainment is a property of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) network and is not a cell autonomous property of mammalian clocks. This differential sensitivity to temperature allows the SCN to drive circadian rhythms in body temperature which can then act as a universal cue for the entrainment of cell autonomous oscillators throughout the body. Pharmacological experiments show that network interactions in the SCN are required for temperature resistance and that the heat shock pathway is integral to temperature resetting and temperature compensation in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the evolutionarily ancient temperature resetting response can be utilized in homeothermic animals to enhance internal circadian synchronization.",

		"abstract": "Exercise training results in adaptations to numerous organ systems and offers protection against metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and recent reports suggest that adipose tissue may play a role in these beneficial effects of exercise on overall health. Multiple studies have investigated the effects of exercise training on both white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), as well as the induction of beige adipocytes. Studies from both rodents and humans show that there are exercise training-induced changes in WAT including decreased cell size and lipid content, and increased mitochondrial activity. In rodents, exercise training causes an increased beiging of WAT. Whether exercise training causes a beiging of human scWAT, as well as which factors contribute to the exercise-induced beiging of WAT are areas of current investigation. Studies investigating the effects of exercise training on BAT mass and function have yielded conflicting data, and hence, is another area of intensive investigation. This review will focus on studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms regulating exercise training induced-adaptations to adipose tissue.",

		"abstract": "The master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus in the brain regulates circadian rhythms in mammals. Similar circadian oscillators have been found in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, intestine and retina. Life span has been previously linked independently to both circadian rhythms and caloric restriction (CR). The mechanisms by which CR attenuates ageing and extends life span are virtually unknown. It has recently been found that the αMUPA mice, transgenic mice that exhibit spontaneously reduced eating and live longer compared to their FVB/N wild-type control mice, show high amplitude, appropriately reset circadian rhythms. These pronounced rhythms were found both in clock gene expression in the liver and clock-controlled output systems, such as feeding time and body temperature. Furthermore, it was previously shown that CR could reset the central biological clock in the SCN. As the circadian clock in the SCN controls many physiological and biochemical systems, we suggest that appropriately reset peripheral rhythms could constitute an important mediator of longevity in calorically restricted animals. Thus, we suggest that three parameters, i.e., caloric restriction, circadian rhythms and life span, are interconnected. This surmise is novel, and we provide evidence to support it. Furthermore, we discuss other feeding regimens and their effects on circadian rhythms and/or life span.",

		"abstract": "The circadian rhythm of core temperature depends upon several interacting rhythms, of both endogenous and exogenous origin, but an understanding of the process requires these two components to be separated. Constant routines remove the exogenous (masking) component at source, but they are severely limited in their application. By contrast, several purification methods have successfully reduced the masking component of overt circadian rhythms measured in field circumstances. One important, but incidental, outcome from these methods is that they enable a quantitative estimate of masking effects to be obtained. It has been shown that these effects of activity upon the temperature rhythm show circadian rhythmicity, and more detailed investigations of this have aided our understanding of thermoregulation and the genesis of the circadian rhythm of core temperature itself. The observed circadian rhythm of body temperature varies with age; in comparison with adults, it is poorly developed in the neonate and deteriorates in the aged subject. Comparing masked and purified data enables the reasons for these differences – whether due to the body clock, the effector pathways or organs, or irregularities due to the individual's lifestyle – to begin to be understood. Such investigations stress the immaturity of the circadian rhythm in the human neonate and its deterioration in elderly compared with younger subjects, but they also indicate the robustness of the body clock itself into advanced age, at least in mice.",

		"abstract": "<p>The study investigated if markers of muscle injury and antioxidant status were affected by a Wingate test performed at 2 different times of day. 15 young male footballers performed 2 tests (randomized) at 07:00-h and 17:00-h. Fasting blood samples were collected before and 3 min after each test for assessment of markers of muscle injury and antioxidant status. Resting oral temperature was recorded during each session. Peak power (10.76±1.05 vs. 11.15±0.83 W.kg<sup> − 1</sup>) and fatigue index (0.41±0.04 vs. 0.49±0.13%) during the Wingate test, and core temperature, were significantly higher (all p<0.05) in the evening. Markers of muscle injury were significantly higher in the evening before and after exercise (e. g., 148.7±67.05 vs. 195±74.6 and 191.6±79.52 vs. 263.6±96.06 IU.L<sup> − 1</sup>, respectively, for creatine kinase; both p<0.001). Antioxidant parameters increased after the Wingate test but only resting values were significantly higher in the morning (e. g., 1.33±0.19 vs. 1.19±0.14 µmol.L<sup> − 1</sup> for total antioxidant status; p<0.05). The results indicate that muscle injury and antioxidant activity after the Wingate test were higher in the evening, suggesting a possible link between the biochemical measures and the diurnal fluctuation of anaerobic performance. However, repetition of this study after prescribed rather than self-selected exercise intensity is recommended.</p>",

		"abstract": "The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde has long been considered as an important method to produce acetaldehyde and clean hydrogen gas. Although monometallic Cu nanoparticles have high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol, they quickly deactivate due to sintering of Cu. Herein, we show that adding a small amount of Ni (Ni0.01Cu − Ni0.001Cu) into Cu to form highly dilute NiCu alloys dramatically increases the catalytic activity and increases their long-term stability. The kinetic studies show that the apparent activation energy decreases from ∼70kJ/mol over Cu to ∼45kJ/mol over the dilute NiCu alloys. The improved performance is observed both for nanoparticles and nanoporous NiCu alloys. The improvement in the long-term stability of the catalysts is attributed to the stabilization of Cu against sintering. Our characterization data show that Ni is atomically dispersed in Cu. The comparison of the catalytic performance of highly dilute alloy nanoparticles with nanoporous materials is useful to guide the design of novel mesoporous catalyst architectures for selective dehydrogenation reactions.",

		"abstract": "The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde has been studied over a series of unsupported copper-chromium catalysts. The results indicate that the sintering occurs in both reduction and dehydrogenation processes. The Cr2O3-promoted copper catalysts prevent sintering in both reduction and reaction processes. The catalyst with Cr/Cu molar ratio of 4/40 has the highest activity and stability. The temperature-programmed reduction results indicate that the good dispersion of Cr2O3 promoter helps to prevent sintering in the reduction process. The catalyst which contains Cu and CuCr2O4 has a lower initial activity and the thermal stability is as poor as the unpromoted one. Cu0 instead of Cu2+ is the active site. The TOFs of promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu = 1/40 to 6/40 are lower than that of unpromoted catalyst, and thus the chromic oxide is not just a textural promoter of Cu. The higher copper surface areas of promoted catalysts easily overcome the loss in TOFs.",

Copper contents varied from 5% to 15% and SiO2 was used as support. All catalysts were characterized by BET, DSC, SEM and TPR and tested by an n-butanol dehydrogenation reaction for activities and stabilities. BET analysis showed that the catalysts prepared by the two methods present larger average pore size and less surface area than those of the fresh SiO2, indicating that smaller pores may get blocked during the course of preparation. This blockage is more severe in the impregnation method. SEM photos showed that the electroless method produces smaller copper crystals than the impregnated method. The reaction activity was found to be in the order of the calcined electroless copper catalyst>the fresh electroless copper catalyst>impregnated copper catalyst. © 1998 Society of Chemical Industry",

		"abstract": "In the recent years, the interest in the ethanol production from renewable natural sources, as a possible alternative energy vector, has strongly grown in the world. The low-cost ethanol availability has also favored the study of the production of different chemicals such as ethylene, ethyl ether, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate starting from ethanol as raw material. In this paper, ethanol dehydrogenation to ethyl acetate, in one step reaction, has been studied by using three different commercial copper based catalysts. The reaction has been conducted in a conventional packed bed tubular reactor, by exploring a temperature range of 200–260°C and a pressure range of 10–30 bars. The best results have been found by using a commercial copper/copper chromite catalyst, supported on alumina and containing barium chromite as promoter, operating at 220–240°C, 20 bars and 98ghmol−1 of ethanol contact time. In these conditions, a conversion of 65% with a selectivity to ethyl acetate of 98–99% has been obtained. However, the effect of temperature, pressure and ethanol contact time on both conversion and selectivity to ethyl acetate has been investigated. Moreover, the best catalyst has also shown a good stability to deactivation. For these reasons, the behavior of this catalyst has been subjected to a deeper investigation. The obtained results have been discussed on the basis of a reliable reaction scheme and mechanism. At last, a simplified scheme of a possible process is reported.",

		"abstract": "The direct synthesis of ethyl acetate from ethanol, a renewable raw material, was studied using PdO/SiO2 catalysts and the oxidative route. These catalysts were prepared by ionic exchange and also by impregnation. They were characterized by XPS, UV–vis, XRD, chemical analysis and BET. These catalysts were tested under different experimental conditions using a conventional system with a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. It was inferred that the ethyl acetate synthesis occurs via ethanol oxidation followed by the condensation reaction of acetaldehyde and ethanol or ethoxide species. It can be suggested that the rate limiting step of the synthesis change according to the rate of ethanol consumption. For low rates, the limiting step is the ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, and for the high ones, it is the condensation reaction. It was verified that the catalysts preparation conditions modify the PdO distribution on the support and its particle sizes, therefore, changing the ethanol consumption rate, and consequently, the selectivities to acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, acetic acid and CO2. This work shows that the ethyl acetate synthesis by the oxidative route using PdO/SiO2 catalyst can be considered as a very promising new process.",

		"abstract": "The formaldehyde synthesis from methanol was investigated over a polycrystalline silver catalyst at temperatures up to 993K. Water was added to the feed (water ballast process) like in the commercial BASF process. The conversion of methanol and the selectivity to formaldehyde appeared to increase with respect to the methanol ballast process with no added water. A long-time experiment was carried out lasting over more than 300 days time-on-stream. While the methanol conversion does not change significantly, there is a pronounced change in hydrogen and CO2 selectivity. A most noteworthy observation is that over months of operation, the width of the temperature region where formic acid is formed increases in a linear manner. Finally, interrupting the oxygen supply for a few hours led to a temporary deterioration of the product selectivity after oxygen re-admittance. All observations may well be interpreted in the framework of the commonly discussed silveroxygen chemistry with its three different oxygen species (Oα, Oβ and Oγ).",

The effect of copper content on the crystallographic phase and BET surface area of the catalysts calcined at 400°C for 24 h was investigated. Catalysts containing ≤16 wt.-% copper did not show any copper containing phase indicating the presence of highly dispersed or amorphous copper species. These catalysts have shown high copper metal areas ranging from 308 to 108 m2/g-Cu as determined by the reaction of nitrous oxide with copper surfaces at 90°C. While catalysts with low copper content exhibited both dehydration and dehydrogenation activity, those with high copper content showed only dehydrogenation activity at reaction temperatures of 250–300°C. The selectivities for dehydrogenation products were correlated with copper areas of the catalysts.",

In addition to the current efficiency of CO2, that of acetaldehyde was determined as a function of the flow rate. At polycrystalline platinum, ethanol oxidation produces only acetaldehyde; the amount of acetaldehyde further oxidized to acetic acid is negligible due to convection conditions. For comparison and for calibration purposes, i-propanol oxidation was examined for which acetone is the only oxidation product. At Pt(11,1,1), the main oxidation product is acetaldehyde. At Pt(311), in addition to acetaldehyde, acetic acid was also formed. Surface modification with Sn did not increase the reactivity of Pt(11,1,1) instead it led to inhibition of the ethanol oxidation. In the case of Pt(311), the onset potential of oxidation was shifted negatively by 0.2 V in the presence of Sn. The results of the potentiostatic measurements showed that this shift is not associated with the production of CO2; rather acetic acid and acetaldehyde are the main oxidation products.",

We show that the synthetic route to γ-Al2O3 is the starting point that determines the micro- and macrostructure of the oxide and, consequently, allows control of the support characteristics. The relevance of the adequate structural characterization of the oxide as well as of its surface sorption behavior through the proton-affinity distributions, are considered. The usefulness of the latter during supported catalyst preparation, for catalytic active sites characterization, and for stability evaluation after calcination are discussed for the Co/γ-Al2O3 system in particular.

It was generated during the AE, IE and HDP methods and decomposed to CuO after calcination at 450 °C, which was supported by BET, TPR, XRD and TEM. Copper phyllosilicate can be reduced to Cu0 rather than Cu+ below 350 °C. The formation of copper phyllosilicate promoted the dispersion of copper species. The Cu/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the AE method possessed the highest Cu0 dispersion due to the high content of copper phyllosilicate in the catalyst precursor and thus exhibited the best activity for the hydrogenation of methyl acetate.",

The experiment was planned for a group of two or three students for two 6 h long sessions. The copper catalyst was synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation of the silica support with copper(II) nitrate trihydrate as the precursor of the active phase. It was then dried, calcined, and reduced. Each step of the synthesis was characterized by color change. The catalytic reaction was performed as a continuous process in a flow reactor, and the postreaction mixture was analyzed using gas chromatography. The laboratory experiment showed practical aspects of heterogeneous catalysis and encouraged students to seek alternative, environmentally friendly methods of organic compound synthesis.",

		"abstract": "The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde is of great importance in synthetic chemistry and the fine chemical industry. In this study, we report that a mesoporous-carbon-supported Cu catalyst exhibited a high reaction rate and excellent product selectivity in ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. Under the severe conditions of an ethanol concentration of 15 vol % and a gaseous hourly space velocity of 8 600 h−1, the Cu-based carbon catalyst maintains a conversion of ≈73 % and an acetaldehyde selectivity of ≈94 % at 553 K. Meanwhile, a prominent space time yield (225 h−1) of acetaldehyde is obtained, which is far higher than that (112 h−1) on the mesoporous-SBA-15-supported Cu catalyst. Ethanol adsorption studies prove that the enrichment of the carbon support for reactants makes a contribution to the high reaction rate. Importantly, kinetic measurements indicate that the scarce surface groups of the mesoporous carbon support minimize the secondary reactions of acetaldehyde, which are generally catalyzed by OH and/or COOH on the surface of the support as exemplified by the mesoporous-SBA-15-supported Cu catalyst. This accounts for the excellent selectivity toward acetaldehyde on the mesoporous-carbon-supported Cu catalyst. Therefore, these surface characteristics of the carbon support show great advantages in this dehydrogenation reaction.",

		"abstract": "A silica-supported Ag catalyst has been shown to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidant-free dehydrogenation of ethanol into acetaldehyde. The reaction mechanism has been investigated by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The kinetic isotope effects for proton and hydride abstraction have been studied by using CH3CD2OH and CH3CH2OD as labeled reactants. The results indicate that OH bond activation and the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex take place on the silica support and that the Ag particles are necessary for the activation of the CH bond. The kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD) is 1.9 for CH3CD2OH and 1.8 for CH3CH2OD. The concerted mechanism of CH cleavage on the Ag sites and proton abstraction on the silica sites is proposed to account for the results of the spectroscopic and kinetic experiments.",

		"abstract": "Two samples of activated carbons were used in this study:  one of coal origin and one of wood origin. The initial samples were modified by impregnation with urea followed by heat treatment at 450 and 950 °C. The pore structure and surface chemistry of the initial and modified samples were characterized by using sorption of nitrogen, Boehm and potentiometric titration, and thermal analysis. The results showed differences in structural characteristics and in the surface chemical inventory. Gas chromatography at infinite dilution was used to study the adsorption of acetaldehyde. The isosteric heats of adsorption were calculated from the values of the retention volumes. After urea modification, which resulted in an increase in the total number of surface groups and a decrease in the surface area and the micropore volume, the strength of the interactions of acetaldehyde with the carbon surface decreased. The adsorption forces are strong in small pores, and their volume governs the amount adsorbed. This amount can be enhanced when functional groups containing nitrogen are present. These groups can provide additional adsorption centers when all high-energy centers, small pores, are filled with acetaldehyde molecules.",

		"title": "Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, a Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex",
		"container-title": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits",
		"volume": "10",
		"source": "PubMed Central",
		"abstract": "Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.",

		"abstract": "The magnitude of the real-time digital signal processing challenge attached to large radio astronomical antenna arrays motivates use of high performance computing (HPC) systems. The need for high power efficiency (performance per watt) at remote observatory sites parallels that in HPC broadly, where efficiency is an emerging critical metric. We investigate how the performance per watt of graphics processing units (GPUs) is affected by temperature, core clock frequency and voltage. Our results highlight how the underlying physical processes that govern transistor operation affect power efficiency. In particular, we show experimentally that GPU power consumption grows non-linearly with both temperature and supply voltage, as predicted by physical transistor models. We show lowering GPU supply voltage and increasing clock frequency while maintaining a low die temperature increases the power efficiency of an NVIDIA K20 GPU by up to 37-48% over default settings when running xGPU, a compute-bound code used in radio astronomy. We discuss how temperature-aware power models could be used to reduce power consumption for future HPC installations. Automatic temperature-aware and application-dependent voltage and frequency scaling (T-DVFS and A-DVFS) may provide a mechanism to achieve better power efficiency for a wider range of codes running on GPUs",

		"abstract": "There is renewed interest in passive 2-phase immersion for cooling power electronics and high performance computers. This can be attributed to recent research showing its performance potential compared with more complex and costly techniques, to innovations that simplify its application and to a general trend toward higher power densities. Though the thermal performance capabilities of passive 2-phase immersion cooling are well documented, the technique is not widely practiced and system designers will find little published information concerning subtler and very critical aspects of system design. There is no manual, for example, concerning practical details like material compatibility, electrical signal integrity (SI), fluid decomposition, management of moisture and light gases, and so on. This paper presents a useful material compatibility test method and explains the mechanisms of distillation and extraction that are intrinsic to a refluxing 2-phase system and by which wetted materials interact with the fluid and each other. It discusses sources, implications and techniques for removal of organic contaminants, water, non-condensable air and fluid thermal decomposition products. Data are presented from sub-20 GHz SI experiments conducted with backplane connectors and microstrip transmission lines submerged in two classes of environmentally sustainable working fluids. It is hoped that this overview will demystify these subjects for designers unfamiliar with passive 2-phase immersion cooling and encourage more widespread adoption of this elegant and proven technology.",

		"abstract": "The relentless increase in the heat flux dissipation levels in electronic devices has necessitated development of new thermal management methods that can handle such heat flux levels, while maintaining the device at temperatures low. Direct cooling of the electronic components using dielectric liquid coolants, along with phase-change heat transfer, has the potential to achieve these goals. In this work, the enhancement of boiling heat transfer by the use of a thermally conductive copper microporous coating with a dielectric coolant (3M Novec HFE-7100) under two configurations is studied: passive pool boiling, and spray impingement boiling.\nPool boiling experiments were performed on microporous surfaces and plain surfaces. The microporous surfaces, with coating thicknesses in the range 100 to 700 &mgr;m, and porosity of ~57%, showed a significantly lower boiling incipience temperature, enhanced the heat transfer coefficient by 50–270%, and enhanced the critical heat fluxes (CHF) by 33–60%, when compared to the plain surface. At low heat flux levels, the surface with a thicker microporous coating showed better performance than the thinner one. However, the thinner microporous coating resulted in higher CHF than the thicker surface. High-speed visualization was used to measure the nucleation site density, bubble diameter at departure, and bubble departure frequency. Based on a simple heat flux partition model, neglecting the heat transfer effects due to bubble coalescence, the individual modes of heat transfer (evaporative and single-phase) were computed. Reasonably good agreement between the partition model and the experimental data was obtained. On the plain surfaces, the evaporative and single-phase components were approximately equal, while on the microporous surfaces, the evaporative component was found to be significantly higher.\nWe also investigated spray boiling heat transfer performance on the microporous copper surface. Heat transfer data was measured using two full-cone spray nozzles spanning a range of volumetric flow rate from 1.1 cm3/s to 15.8 cm3/s, and liquid subcooling levels from 30 °C to 0 °C. The microporous surface showed an enhancement of 300%–600% in the heat transfer coefficient at a given wall superheat compared the plain surface. The CHF also increased by up to 80%. Counterintuitively, we observed that the liquid spray at near-saturated temperature (0 °C subcooling) had higher heat transfer coefficient and CHF than the subcooled spray, on both surfaces. This likely results from the limited residence time of the liquid droplets in contact with the heater surface and the much higher efficiency of phase change heat transfer. The near-saturated spray undergoes phase change much faster than the subcooled liquid, removing heat more efficiently than the subcooled liquid. New correlations are proposed for predicting the CHF of spray impingement boiling on both plain and enhanced surfaces.",

The Copper nanoparticles were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry. The results show that with the increase in the molar ratio of L-ascorbic acid the concentration of Copper nanoparticles were also increased.

		"abstract": "Junction-to-fluid thermal resistivities, R\"jf, of two dual-side-soldered insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules immersion-cooled in a hydrofluoroether C3F7OCH3 liquid were measured experimentally. R\"jf=0.040degC-cm2/W for 0.144 cm2 die at a peak heat flux of 1180 W/cm2 and 55 Amps and 0.11degC-cm2/W for 1.46 cm2 die at a peak heat flux of 550 W/cm2 and 305 Amps. A technique for automatic in situ degassing that would reduce manufacturing cost and permit field servicing of immersion systems that reach sub-ambient pressure when idle showed fluid loss rates of 0.3 g per 100 cc of air vented, roughly 1/100th that expected from an HFC-134a air conditioning system with a similar leak. Experiments to quantify packaging density and fluid requirements suggest that 100cc of fluid is required to dissipate 1kW and packaging density is limited only by the electrical bus geometry.",

		"abstract": "The enhancement of pool boiling heat transfer by copper-particle surface coatings is experimentally investigated, using the wetting dielectric fluid FC-72. In one technique, loose copper particles are placed on a heated copper surface to provide additional vapor nucleation sites in the cavities formed at particle-surface and particle–particle contact points, thereby enhancing boiling performance over a polished surface. This ‘free-particle’ technique is benchmarked against the more traditional technique of sintering a fixed layer of copper particles to the surface to enhance boiling heat transfer performance. The effect of particle size on the heat transfer performance is studied for particle diameters ranging from 45μm to 1000μm at a constant coating layer thickness-to-particle diameter ratio of approximately 4. The parametric trends in the boiling curve and the critical heat flux are compared between the two techniques, and the dominant boiling mechanisms influencing these trends are compared and contrasted. High-speed visualizations are performed to qualitatively assess the boiling patterns and bubble departure size/distribution, and thus corroborate the trends observed in the boiling curves. The measured wall superheat is significantly lower with a sintered coating compared to the free-particle layer for any given particle size and heat flux. Performance trends with respect to particle size, however, are remarkably similar for both enhancement techniques, and an optimum particle size of ∼100μm is identified for both free particles and sintered coatings. The free-particle technique is shown to offer a straightforward method to screen the boiling enhancement trends expected from different particulate layer compositions that are intended to be subsequently fabricated by sintering.",

		"abstract": "The present research is an experimental study of “double enhancement” behavior in pool boiling from heater surfaces simulating microelectronic devices immersed in saturated FC-72 at atmospheric pressure. The term “double enhancement” refers to the combination of two different enhancement techniques: a large-scale area enhancement (square pin fin array) and a small-scale surface enhancement (microporous coating). Fin lengths were varied from 0 (flat surface) to 8 mm. Effects of this double enhancement technique on critical heat flux (CHF) and nucleate boiling heat transfer in the horizontal orientation (fins are vertical) are investigated. Results showed significant increases in nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients with the application of the microporous coating to the heater surfaces. CHF was found to be relatively insensitive to surface microstructure for the finned surfaces except in the case of the surface with 8-mm-long fins. The nucleate boiling and CHF behavior has been found to be the result of multiple, counteracting mechanisms: surface area enhancement, fin efficiency, surface microstructure (active nucleation site density), vapor bubble departure resistance, and re-wetting liquid flow resistance.

Between a 70 and 80% reduction in nucleate boiling superheats, and as much as a 100% increase in the maximum heat flux (critical heat flux-CHF), beyond that of the nontreated reference surface.

		"abstract": "This paper discusses the economic and environmental merits of passive 2-phase immersion in semi-open baths of dielectric fluid for cooling datacom equipment such as servers. The technique eliminates the need for hermetic connectors, pressure vessels, seals and clamshells typically associated with immersion cooling and the connectors, plumping, pumps and cold plates associated with more traditional liquid cooling techniques. A board level power density of 11.7W/cm2 can be sustained with 100 cm3 of fluid per kW. The modular 80 kW baths modeled can eject 130 kW per m2 of floor space via water-cooled condensers. It is estimated that 28°C water at 15 gpm could maintain average CPU junction temperatures, Tj<;60°C and 62°C water at 30 gpm could maintain Tj<;85°C, maximizing the availability of the heat for other purposes. Alternatively, the heat can be transferred directly to ambient air without water as an intermediate. The costs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with conservative annual fluid emission estimates are found to be less than those associated with the electrical power required for traditional chassis fans and liquid pumps. Since these fugitive losses occur at one point, more efficient capture techniques can be easily applied.",

This paper makes a comparison of the full energy consumption between hybrid air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled systems based on real operational systems using comparable IT components.

Two-phase immersion cooling directly cools multiple heat sources with various shapes which enables simple and flexible thermal design by fulfilling the existing electronic device with a coolant. The challenge is to reduce internal thermal resistance from heat sources to the chassis surface by effective thermal diffusion induced by two-phase immersion. The study covers selection of coolant and effect of coolant filling ratio. Then heat dissipation performance by single and multiple heat sources as well as enhancement by two-phase immersion with conduction materials are experimentally tested. Leaf spring and coil spring, both made of phosphor bronze, are used as the conduction materials and compared with rigid copper block in two-phase immersion. Experiment setup contains a vertical heating plate and an outer wall with heatsink separated by a gap space. Thermal resistance of basic two-phase immersion and enhancement by conduction materials are compared to provide design guideline for two-phase immersion application in a closed device.",

		"abstract": "This paper evaluates boiling heat transfer performance on a lotus-type of porous copper attached on a heated surface. The experiments are performed under atmospheric and saturated pool conditions. The lotus porous medium has uni-directional pore structure and the average size of the pore hole is 0.4 mm. The porous plate of 1.0 mm or 2.0 mm in thickness is mechanically attached onto the heated surface in order to obtain the referential data of this porous media. The boiling curves suggest that utilization of the lotus porous medium definitely leads to boiling heat transfer enhancement. For instance, at the wall superheat of 10 - 20 K, the boiling heat transfer coefficient is 2 - 3 times higher than that of the bare surface. In the low wall superheat regime, the heat transfer coefficient also increases with increasing wall superheat. On the other hand, the results also verify that the thickness of the lotus porous doesn't affect the boiling heat transfer coefficient at all, which suggests that there is a big contact thermal resistance between the heated surface and the lotus plate. In that sense, it is predicted that the boiling phenomena is conceivably dominant mainly at the bottom of the lotus porous. In addition, it is confirmed that the critical heat flux is almost the same as that in the bare surface case, which also indicates us that it needs to enhance the liquid supply toward the inside the lotus porous.",

The experiments investigated the effects of surface inclination, from upward-facing (0°) to downward-facing (180°), and liquid subcooling from 0 to 30K on nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux. The presented experimental data and correlations for natural convection of dielectric liquids on PG and plane surfaces are important for cooling chips while in the standby mode when surface heat flux <20kW/m2. The experimental curves of the nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient for FC-72 dielectric liquid in the upward-facing orientation are used in 3-D thermal analysis for sizing and quantifying the performance of copper (Cu), PG and PG–Cu composite spreaders for removing the dissipated thermal power by an underlying 10×10mm computer chip with non-uniform heat dissipation. The 2mm-thick spreaders are cooled by either saturation or 30K subcooled nucleate boiling of FC-72 and the composite spreader consists of 0.4mm-thick surface layer of PG and 1.6mm-thick Cu substrate.",

These assemblies were tested using a segregated hydrofluoroether (HFE) working fluid C3F7 OCH3 on 1.0, 4.0 and 13.7 cm2 heat sources at atmospheric pressure. The best of these yielded sink-to-fluid resistances, Rsf, at 230W of 0.092, 0.047 and 0.024degC/W, respectively. This boiler assembly was incorporated into a thermosyphon with a remote 100times100times2.2mm finned-tube condenser that produced a condensation resistance, Rfa, of ~0.1degC/W with a 7.6W 92times3 8mm fan. That thermosyphon was tested on the aforementioned heat sources yielding much improved Rsf values of 0.083, 0.026 and 0.014degC/W at 150W. Data gathered with larger condensers or more powerful fans suggest that it is quite practical to produce a compact thermosyphon that can cool a 20mm device generating 250W with Rsa<0.10C/W, a performance level competitive with forced water systems",

However, GF-diet may lead to possible nutrient unbalance resulting in improper nutritional quality of diet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the nutritional quality of GF-diet. MEDLINE®/PubMed and Cochrane Library were electronically searched for articles published between 1990/01/01 and 2015/09/01. GF-diet was found to be poor in alimentary fiber due in particular to the necessary avoidance of several kinds of foods naturally rich in fiber (i.e. grain) and the low content of fiber of GF product that are usually made with starches and/or refined flours. Micronutrients are also found to be poor, in particular Vit. D, Vit. B12 and folate, in addition to some minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. Moreover, an inadequate macronutrient intake was reported related above all to the focus on the avoidance of gluten that often leaving back the importance of nutritional quality of the choice. In particular, it was found a higher content of both saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids and an increase in the glycemic index and glycemic load of the meal. Despite the GF-diet is necessary in celiac disease treatment and the attention is on gluten avoidance, the evaluation of nutritional quality of the diet must be considered. Moreover, educational strategies based on the relationship between nutrients and food and human health could be developed to optimize the therapeutic approach in celiac patients.",

		"abstract": "Background\n\nLife-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the ‘no detectable gluten’ diet.\n\n\nMethods\n\nSeven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18–71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data.\n\n\nResults\n\nNutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nDietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.",

		"abstract": "Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the cornerstone treatment for celiac disease (CD). GFD implies a strict and lifelong elimination from the diet of gluten, the storage protein found in wheat, barley, rye and hybrids of these grains, such as kamut and triticale. The absence of gluten in natural and processed foods, despite being the key aspect of GFD, may lead to nutritional consequences, such as deficits and imbalances. The nutritional adequacy of GFD is particularly important in children, this the age being of maximal energy and nutrient requirements for growth, development and activity. In recent years, attention has focused on the nutritional quality of gluten-free products (GFPs) available in the market. It is well recognized that GFPs are considered of lower quality and poorer nutritional value compared to the gluten-containing counterparts. The present review focuses on the nutritional adequacy of GFD at the pediatric age, with the aim being to increase awareness of the potential complications associated with this diet, to identify strategies in order to avoid them and to promote a healthier diet and lifestyle in children with CD.",

		"abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic disease causing the inflammation of the proximal small intestine, in genetically predisposed individuals. This is triggered by the consumption of the gluten protein and the side effects of the disease are mitigated by a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment. The predominant consequence of CD is malnutrition due to malabsorption (with diarrhea, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and altered blood parameters), especially in patients who do not show strict adherence to GFD treatment. Recent evidence shows that, despite a lifelong GFD, some functional disorders persist, such as compromised gallbladder function and motility, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, increased gut permeability, small-intestinal bowel overgrowth, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lactose intolerance, and milk allergy. These abnormalities may predispose to the occurrence of overweight and obesity even in CD patients. This review focuses on the principal functional and metabolic disorders in both treated and untreated CD, ranging from alterations of the gastrointestinal system to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin secretion with the aim of providing new implications beyond a GFD, for an ad hoc nutrition treatment in these patients.",

The effect of the sintering temperature, boric acid content and modulus of sodium silicate on the thermal conductivity, density, compression strength and microstructure of the adiabatic foam was studied in detail. In the sintering process, B3+ ion can take the place of the Si4+ ion by incorporating into the Si–O–Si structure via Si–O–B bridges, increasing the chemical stability of the adiabatic foam. High temperature, low boric acid content and low modulus of sodium silicate can reduce the thermal conductivity, density and compression strength. In order to meet the application of exterior wall thermal insulation, 450–500 °C of the sintering temperature, 18–24 g boric acid per 600 g sodium silicate solution, and 2.5–2.8 modulus of sodium silicate are chosen.

		"abstract": "Fabrication of adiabatic foam by sodium silicate with glass fiber as supporting body was researched in this paper. The variation of the thermal conductivity, density, and compression strength with the sintering temperature, modulus of sodium silicate and glass fiber content were characterized. The results show that through sintering at 450°C with 3.3 modulus of sodium silicate and less than 0.67wt.% content of glass fiber, the adiabatic foam with 0.0454–0.0459W/mK of thermal conductivity, 74–80kg/m3 of density, and 0.42–0.46MPa of compression strength can be obtained. Therefore, this adiabatic foam has a large potential of thermal insulation application.",

		"abstract": "Glass foams are known to represent highly valuable products for thermal and acoustic insulation, often produced by employing wastes. Although the usage of recycled glass is widely reported for developing the glass matrix, little research has been due to the usage of wastes for the foaming reaction. In this work the cellular structure is achieved after oxidation of SiC-based wastes coming from the polishing of glass articles. The foamed recycled soda-lime glass incorporated the residues from oxidation and provided a reasonably good chemical stability. The addition of MnO2 to the starting mixtures of wastes led to a certain improvement of the oxidation of SiC, and a complex effect on the correlation between density and mechanical strength. For selected additions, a more homogeneous foaming was found to provide a stronger cellular structure.",

		"abstract": "A balanced and varied diet is the best source of essential vitamins and minerals; however, nutrient deficiencies occur, including in populations with bountiful food supplies and the means to procure nutrient-rich foods. For example, the typical American diet bears little resemblance to what experts recommend for fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, which serve as important sources of an array of vitamins and minerals. With time, deficiencies in one or more micronutrients may lead to serious health issues. A common reason people take multivitamin and mineral (MVM) supplements is to maintain or improve health, but research examining the effectiveness of MVMs in the prevention of certain chronic conditions is ongoing. In addition to the utility of MVMs for filling in relatively small but critical nutritional gaps, which may help prevent conditions such as anemia, neural tube defects, and osteoporosis, some evidence supports possible benefits of MVM supplementation with regard to cancer prevention (particularly in men) and prevention or delay of cataract, as well as some aspects of cognitive performance. Unlike some single-vitamin supplements, MVM supplements are generally well tolerated and do not appear to increase the risk of mortality, cerebrovascular disease, or heart failure. The potential benefits of MVM supplements likely outweigh any risk in the general population and may be particularly beneficial for older people.",

		"abstract": "This study explored the neurocognitive effects of 4 weeks daily supplementation with a multi-vitamin and -mineral combination (MVM) in healthy adults (aged 18–40 years). Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, participants underwent assessments of brain activity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI; n = 32, 16 females) and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential recordings (SSVEP; n = 39, 20 females) during working memory and continuous performance tasks at baseline and following 4 weeks of active MVM treatment or placebo. There were several treatment-related effects suggestive of changes in functional brain activity associated with MVM administration. SSVEP data showed latency reductions across centro-parietal regions during the encoding period of a spatial working memory task following 4 weeks of active MVM treatment. Complementary results were observed with the fMRI data, in which a subset of those completing fMRI assessment after SSVEP assessment (n = 16) demonstrated increased BOLD response during completion of the Rapid Visual Information Processing task (RVIP) within regions of interest including bilateral parietal lobes. No treatment-related changes in fMRI data were observed in those who had not first undergone SSVEP assessment, suggesting these results may be most evident under conditions of fatigue. Performance on the working memory and continuous performance tasks did not significantly differ between treatment groups at follow-up. In addition, within the fatigued fMRI sample, increased RVIP BOLD response was correlated with the change in number of target detections as part of the RVIP task. This study provides preliminary evidence of changes in functional brain activity during working memory associated with 4 weeks of daily treatment with a multi-vitamin and -mineral combination in healthy adults, using two distinct but complementary measures of functional brain activity.",

This analysis aimed to assess contributions of micronutrients to usual intakes derived from all sources (naturally occurring, fortified and enriched, and dietary supplements) and to compare usual intakes to the Dietary Reference Intake for U.S. residents aged ≥2 y according to NHANES 2003–2006 (n = 16,110). We used the National Cancer Institute method to assess usual intakes of 19 micronutrients by source. Only a small percentage of the population had total usual intakes (from dietary intakes and supplements) below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for the following: vitamin B-6 (8%), folate (8%), zinc (8%), thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-12, phosphorus, iron, copper, and selenium (<6% for all). However, more of the population had total usual intakes below the EAR for vitamins A, C, D, and E (34, 25, 70, and 60%, respectively), calcium (38%), and magnesium (45%). Only 3 and 35% had total usual intakes of potassium and vitamin K, respectively, greater than the adequate intake. Enrichment and/or fortification largely contributed to intakes of vitamins A, C, and D, thiamin, iron, and folate. Dietary supplements further reduced the percentage of the population consuming less than the EAR for all nutrients. The percentage of the population with total intakes greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) was very low for most nutrients, whereas 10.3 and 8.4% of the population had intakes greater than the UL for niacin and zinc, respectively. Without enrichment and/or fortification and supplementation, many Americans did not achieve the recommended micronutrient intake levels set forth in the Dietary Reference Intake.",

The Western diet is characterized by an over consumption and reduced variety of refined sugars, salt, and saturated fat. Herein our objective is to detail the mechanisms for the Western diet’s impact on immune function. The manuscript reviews the impacts and mechanisms of harm for our over-indulgence in sugar, salt, and fat, as well as the data outlining the impacts of artificial sweeteners, gluten, and genetically modified foods; attention is given to revealing where the literature on the immune impacts of macronutrients is limited to either animal or in vitro models versus where human trials exist. Detailed attention is given to the dietary impact on the gut microbiome and the mechanisms by which our poor dietary choices are encoded into our gut, our genes, and are passed to our offspring. While today’s modern diet may provide beneficial protection from micro- and macronutrient deficiencies, our over abundance of calories and the macronutrients that compose our diet may all lead to increased inflammation, reduced control of infection, increased rates of cancer, and increased risk for allergic and auto-inflammatory disease.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up >=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs (n=277) with between 24 and 28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium & magnesium, calcium & magnesium, and calcium & potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium & magnesium and of calcium & potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the combination of potassium & magnesium. None of the trials provided data on mortality or morbidity. The combination of potassium & magnesium compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I(2)=68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively).A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0). The quality of the trials was not well reported.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium & magnesium is effective.",

		"abstract": "Endothelial nitric oxide synthase is at the centre of endothelial physiology producing nitric oxide which dilates blood vessels, inhibits platelet aggregation and smooth muscle cell proliferation and reduces adhesion molecule production. The laminar shear stress is a common test used usually as the flow mediated dilatation test (FMD) which is sensitive to saturated fat, sodium and potassium although with the latter ion it is possible potassium has direct effects on ion channels in the smooth muscle cell as well as the endothelial cell. High blood pressure and blood cholesterol both reduce nitric oxide production, the latter probably by increasing caveolin-1 which binds nitric oxide synthase. Saturated fat reduces nitric oxide by elevating LDL cholesterol and caveolin-1 while insulin stimulates nitric oxide synthase activity by serine phosphorylation. Polyphenols from tea, coffee and cocoa and virgin olive oil enhance FMD and eNOS activity is essential for this activity. Wine polyphenols produce mixed results and it is not clear at present that they are beneficial. Blackberries and other polyphenol-rich fruit also enhance FMD. Dietary nitrate from beetroot and green leafy vegetables is converted to nitrite by salivary microbes and then to nitric oxide and this acts directly on the smooth muscle to lower blood pressure particularly in a low oxygen environment. Dietary nitrate also improves work efficiency and improves flow mediated dilatation.",

		"abstract": "A benefit-risk evaluation of the evidence for including dairy foods in the diet is presented. For many persons dairy products provide a substantial portion of essential nutrients, but especially calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Dietary supplements and fortified foods can be alternative sources of these nutrients, although other components of dairy foods such as amino acid composition and conjugated linoleic acid may be instrumental in the benefits associated with dairy product consumption for bone health and reduced risk of stroke, metabolic syndrome, and some cancers. Newer evidence shows that protein-induced calciuria does not have a detrimental effect on net calcium retention, and the concentrations of hormones in milk are not outside of the range of endogenous concentrations. Increased dietary protein, including from milk, can elevate serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I, which has an unknown relation to cancer. The concern over consumption of milk leading to increased risk of prostate cancer through reduction of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, a potent anti-prostate cancer hormone, has been resolved with new evidence that local production of this hormone is independent of diet. Overall, evidence suggests that being a lactovegetarian has greater health benefits and reduced health risks than being a vegan.",

Of late, there appears to be an increasing movement toward this practice. There has not been a recent update on these diets from a health perspective. Using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information PubMed database, a search was made for all studies published between 2000 and 2016 that met defined inclusion criteria. A total of 25 studies were located with 12 focusing on body weight and diet quality. There was emerging evidence suggestive of benefits for body weight, improved markers of metabolic health, blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. SVD may also have a role to play in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease. Given that there is a higher tendency for females to be flexitarian yet males are more likely to overconsume meat, there is a clear need to communicate the potential health benefits of these diets to males.",

		"abstract": "This review examines whether there is evidence that a strict vegan diet confers health advantages beyond that of a vegetarian diet or overall healthy eating. Few studies include vegan subjects as a distinct experimental group, yet when vegan diets are directly compared to vegetarian and omnivorous diets, a pattern of protective health benefits emerges. The relatively recent inclusion of vegan diets in studies of gut microbiota and health allows us the opportunity to assess whether the vegan gut microbiota is distinct, and whether the health advantages characteristic of a vegan diet may be partially explained by the associated microbiota profile. The relationship between diet and the intestinal microbial profile appears to follow a continuum, with vegans displaying a gut microbiota most distinct from that of omnivores, but not always significantly different from that of vegetarians. The vegan gut profile appears to be unique in several characteristics, including a reduced abundance of pathobionts and a greater abundance of protective species. Reduced levels of inflammation may be the key feature linking the vegan gut microbiota with protective health effects. However, it is still unclear whether a therapeutic vegan diet can be prescribed to alter the gut microflora for long-term health benefits.",

Recent studies suggest that several of these metabolites that derive from microbial transformation of dietary components have significant effects on physiological processes such as gut and immune homeostasis, energy metabolism, vascular function, and neurological behavior. Here, we review several of the most intriguing diet-dependent metabolites that may impact host physiology and may therefore be appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, tryptophan and tyrosine derivatives, and oxidized fatty acids. Such interventions will require modulating either bacterial species or the bacterial biosynthetic enzymes required to produce these metabolites, so we briefly describe the current understanding of the bacterial and enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis and summarize their molecular mechanisms of action. We then discuss in more detail the impact of these metabolites on health and disease, and review current strategies to modulate levels of these metabolites to promote human health. We also suggest future studies that are needed to realize the full therapeutic potential of targeting the gut microbiota.",

		"abstract": "The long chain n–3 (omega-3) fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), although originally synthesized by microorganisms in the oceans, are primarily obtained from the consumption of fish. Vegetarians, by definition, do not eat fish and thus consume virtually no EPA and DHA. Because conversion of the plant-derived n–3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and DHA is very low, n–3 tissue concentrations in vegetarians are lower than in omnivores. This review asks 2 questions: what is the evidence that increased n–3 concentrations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in vegetarians, and, if it does, how can vegetarians increase their blood and tissue concentrations of these animal-derived fatty acids? At present, both cardiovascular risk markers and cardiovascular events appear to be significantly reduced in vegetarians compared with those in omnivores. If so, and in the absence of data to show that risk in vegetarians could be even lower with higher n–3 concentrations, then the second question becomes moot. However, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; therefore, at our present state of knowledge, increasing n–3 concentrations is not an unreasonable goal for vegetarians. This can be accomplished by a variety of approaches, including increased intakes of ALA, consumption of stearidonic acid–enriched soybean oil (if and when it comes to the market), and the use of supplements containing EPA, DHA, or both derived from nonanimal sources (microalgae, biotech yeast, and, in the future, biotech plant oils).",

Dietary ALA is provided mainly by vegetable oils, especially soybean and rapeseed oils, but is destroyed by partial hydrogenation; it is also present in high amounts in walnuts and flaxseed. Dietary EPA and DHA are provided mainly by fish and so are absent from vegan diets and only present in trace amounts in vegetarian diets. Vegetarians and vegans have lower proportions of DHA in blood and tissue lipids compared with omnivores. High intakes of EPA and DHA (typically in the range of 3–5 g/d) but not ALA have favorable effects on several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and have been postulated to delay arterial aging and cardiovascular mortality, but these intakes are beyond the range of normal dietary intake. Arterial stiffness, which is a measure of arterial aging, appears to be lower in vegans than in omnivores; and risk of CVD in vegetarians and vegans is approximately one-third that in omnivores. Prospective cohort studies showed higher intakes of EPA+DHA, and less consistently ALA, to be associated with a lower risk of CVD, especially fatal coronary heart disease, but meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of supplementation of EPA+DHA or ALA in secondary prevention of CVD showed no clear benefit. Current evidence is insufficient to warrant advising vegans and vegetarians to supplement their diets with EPA or DHA for CVD prevention.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes a new asynchronous spike based neural networks VLSI implementation, inspired by the biological plausibility and low power requirement. The voltage-controlled linear conductance produces the synaptic function of multiplication, weight programming, and summation of synaptic spike currents for the neuron. The operation speed of synaptic computation is up to 300 Mega operations with a small power consumption of 33 microwatts. The overall power consumption can be less in real applications, as individual synapse only consumes the power when there is an active neural input. The neuron is based on multiple combinations of synapses and the HSPICE simulation demonstrates the asynchronous spike behavior of integration-and-firing with a refractory period. The advantages of asynchronous operation, removal of reference clocks, and low voltage operation are exhibited compared to previous pulse-based analogue-mixed neural networks VLSI. The asynchronous spike based neural networks in 0.18μm CMOS VLSI technology is proposed to provide the advantage of analogue-mixed neural network VLSI with small power consumption and no need for a synchronous operation.",

The intrinsic dimensionality of object representation is estimated to be around 100, perhaps with lower dimensionalities for object representations more toward the holistic end of the spectrum. Cognitive knowledge in the form of semantic information and task information feed back to inferotemporal cortex from perirhinal and prefrontal cortex respectively, providing high-level multimodal-based expectations that assist in the interpretation of object stimuli. Integration of object information across eye movements may also contribute to object recognition through a process of active vision.",

Without this inherent microbial community, we would be unable to digest plant polysaccharides and would have trouble extracting lipids from our diet. Resident gut bacteria are an important contributor to healthy metabolism and there is significant evidence linking gut microbiota and metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. In the past few years, neuroscience research has demonstrated the importance of microbiota in the development of brain systems that are vital to both stress reactivity and stress-related behaviours. Here we review recent literature that examines the impact of diet-induced changes in the microbiota on stress-related behaviours including anxiety and depression.",

Here we investigate the impact of targeted inhibition of the first step in TMAO generation, commensal microbial trimethylamine (TMA) production, on diet-induced atherosclerosis. A structural analogue of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (eg intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high choline or carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e−/− mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels. The present studies suggest gut microbial production of TMA specifically, and non-lethal microbial inhibitors in general, may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.",

Mice fed 1.5% TMAO in drinking water for 8 weeks significantly displayed vascular dysfunction and liver damage (p < 0.01). The administration of TBF at 400 and 800 mg per kg bw significantly elevated plasma NO and eNOS concentrations, and serum HDL-C and PGI2 levels, and lowered serum TC, TG, LDL-C, ET-1 and TX-A2 levels of TMAO-fed mice. TBF also reduced serum AST and ALT activities, and hepatic NEFA and MDA levels, and increased the hepatic GSH-Px and SOD activities in TMAO-fed mice, which were consistent with the observations of the histological alterations of the liver. This report firstly showed that dietary TMAO might cause liver damage and TBF prevented TMAO-induced vascular dysfunction and hepatic injury.",

Recent clinical studies show a positive correlation between elevated plasma levels of TMAO and an increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events defined as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Several experimental studies suggest a possible contribution of TMAO to the etiology of cardiovascular diseases by affecting lipid and hormonal homeostasis. On the other hand, TMAO-rich seafood, which is an important source of protein and vitamins in the Mediterranean diet, has been considered beneficial for the circulatory system. Although in humans TMAO is known mainly as a waste product of choline metabolism, a number of studies suggest an involvement of TMAO in important biological functions in numerous organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals. For example, cells use TMAO to maintain cell volume under conditions of osmotic and hydrostatic pressure stresses. In this article, we reviewed well-established chemical and biological properties of TMAO and dietary sources of TMAO, as well as looked at the studies suggesting possible involvement of TMAO in the etiology of cardiovascular and other diseases, such as kidney failure, diabetes, and cancer.",

		"abstract": "Trimethylamine (TMA) and dimethylamine (DMA) are normal components of human urine and are precursors of dimethylnitrosamine, a potent carcinogen. In part, DMA and TMA are products of the metabolism of dietary choline by intestinal bacteria. Most TMA formed in the intestinal tract is later oxidized and excreted as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). Humans treated with large doses of choline smell “fishy” (the odor of TMA). Humans ingest choline as part of foods, and yet rarely smell fishy, suggesting that TMA formation must depend upon the dose of choline ingested. We found that, in adult rats, at low doses of choline (1.5 mmol/kg body wt) only 9 µmol choline (6% of the dose) reached the part of the intestine which is colonized by bacteria (the cecum and colon). After administration of 15 mmol choline/kg body wt, 237 µmol (16% of the dose) reached the cecum and colon. At both doses, 64–65% of the administered choline was absorbed from the intestine by 3 h after the dose. We found that orally administered choline slightly increased TMA and TMAO excretion at doses of choline smaller than 7 mmol/kg body wt, but that there was a disproportionately large increase in TMA excretion per 24 h when larger doses were administered (from 11 µmol TMA and 100 µmol TMAO per kg body wt in controls to 226 µmol TMA and 3617 µmol TMAO per kg body wt in rats treated with 15 mmol choline/kg body wt). DMA excretion increased in a linear fashion as the daily choline dose was increased (from 48 ± 3 µmol/kg body wt in controls to 106 ± 9 µmol/kg body wt in rats treated with 15 mmol choline/kg body wt). These observations support the hypothesis that it is only when intestinal transport systems for the absorption of choline are overloaded that appreciable amounts of this nutrient reach the large bowel and are metabolized to form TMA by intestinal bacteria. DMA formation did not increase in proportion to TMA excretion, suggesting that there is no simple product-precursor relationship between these two amines.",

		"abstract": "Choline is a water-soluble nutrient essential for human life. Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in humans. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut, the extent to which host factors (e.g., genotype) and diet affect TMA production and colonization of these microbes, and the effects TMA-producing microbes have on the bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 79 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified nine strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of colonization by TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest that the TMA-producing status of the gut microbiota should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans., Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and increased trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels have been causally linked with CVD development. This work identifies members of the human gut microbiota responsible for both the accumulation of trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of the proatherogenic compound TMAO, and subsequent decreased choline bioavailability to the host. Understanding how to manipulate the representation and function of choline-consuming, TMA-producing species in the intestinal microbiota could potentially lead to novel means for preventing or treating atherosclerosis and choline deficiency-associated diseases.",

		"abstract": "The gut microbiota is found to be strongly associated with atherosclerosis (AS). Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phytoalexin with anti-AS effects; however, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the anti-AS effects of RSV were related to changes in the gut microbiota. We found that RSV attenuated trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-induced AS in ApoE−/− mice. Meanwhile, RSV decreased TMAO levels by inhibiting commensal microbial trimethylamine (TMA) production via gut microbiota remodeling in mice. Moreover, RSV increased levels of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which increased the bile salt hydrolase activity, thereby enhancing bile acid (BA) deconjugation and fecal excretion in C57BL/6J and ApoE−/− mice. This was associated with a decrease in ileal BA content, repression of the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) axis, and increased cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and hepatic BA neosynthesis. An FXR antagonist had the same effect on FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression as RSV, while an FXR agonist abolished RSV-induced alterations in FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression. In mice treated with antibiotics, RSV neither decreased TMAO levels nor increased hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, RSV-induced inhibition of TMAO-caused AS was also markedly abolished by antibiotics. In conclusion, RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling, and the BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis., Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been identified as a novel and independent risk factor for promoting atherosclerosis (AS) partially through inhibiting hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis. The gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathophysiology of TMAO-induced AS. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phytoalexin with prebiotic benefits. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that phenolic phytochemicals with poor bioavailability are possibly acting primarily through remodeling of the gut microbiota. The current study showed that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling. And RSV-induced hepatic BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through downregulating the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 axis. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms responsible for RSV’s anti-AS effects and indicate that the gut microbiota may become an interesting target for pharmacological or dietary interventions to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.",

		"abstract": "Aims\nTrimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced in host liver from trimethylamine (TMA). TMAO and TMA share common dietary quaternary amine precursors, carnitine and choline, which are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. TMAO recently has been linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and severity of cardiovascular diseases. We examined the effects of anti-atherosclerotic compound meldonium, an aza-analogue of carnitine bioprecursor gamma-butyrobetaine (GBB), on the availability of TMA and TMAO.\nMain methods\nWistar rats received L-carnitine, GBB or choline alone or in combination with meldonium. Plasma, urine and rat small intestine perfusate samples were assayed for L-carnitine, GBB, choline and TMAO using UPLC-MS/MS. Meldonium effects on TMA production by intestinal bacteria from L-carnitine and choline were tested.\nKey findings\nTreatment with meldonium significantly decreased intestinal microbiota-dependent production of TMA/TMAO from L-carnitine, but not from choline. 24hours after the administration of meldonium, the urinary excretion of TMAO was 3.6 times lower in the combination group than in the L-carnitine-alone group. In addition, the administration of meldonium together with L-carnitine significantly increased GBB concentration in blood plasma and in isolated rat small intestine perfusate. Meldonium did not influence bacterial growth and bacterial uptake of L-carnitine, but TMA production by the intestinal microbiota bacteria K. pneumoniae was significantly decreased.\nSignificance\nWe have shown for the first time that TMA/TMAO production from quaternary amines could be decreased by targeting bacterial TMA-production. In addition, the production of pro-atherogenic TMAO can be suppressed by shifting the microbial degradation pattern of supplemental/dietary quaternary amines.",

		"abstract": "Choline was officially recognized as an essential nutrient by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1998. There is a significant variation in the dietary requirement for choline that can be explained by common genetic polymorphisms. Because of its wide-ranging roles in human metabolism, from cell structure to neurotransmitter synthesis, choline-deficiency is now thought to have an impact on diseases such as liver disease, atherosclerosis and possibly neurological disorders. Choline is found in a wide variety of foods. Egg yolks are the most concentrated source of choline in the American diet, providing 680 milligrams per 100 grams. Mean choline intakes for older children, men, women and pregnant women are far below the Adequate Intake established by the IOM. Given the importance of choline in a wide range of critical functions in the human body, coupled with less than optimal intakes among the population, dietary guidance should be developed to encourage the intake of choline-rich foods.",

		"abstract": "<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Dementia is a prevalent condition, affecting 5–7% of people aged 60 years and older, and a leading cause of disability in people aged 60 years and older globally. We aimed to examine the association between alcohol use disorders and dementia risk, with an emphasis on early-onset dementia (<65 years).</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We analysed a nationwide retrospective cohort of all adult (≥20 years) patients admitted to hospital in metropolitan France between 2008 and 2013. The primary exposure was alcohol use disorders and the main outcome was dementia, both defined by International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision discharge diagnosis codes. Characteristics of early-onset dementia were studied among prevalent cases in 2008–13. Associations of alcohol use disorders and other risk factors with dementia onset were analysed in multivariate Cox models among patients admitted to hospital in 2011–13 with no record of dementia in 2008–10.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Of 31 624 156 adults discharged from French hospitals between 2008 and 2013, 1 109 343 were diagnosed with dementia and were included in the analyses. Of the 57 353 (5·2%) cases of early-onset dementia, most were either alcohol-related by definition (22 338 [38·9%]) or had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders (10 115 [17·6%]). Alcohol use disorders were the strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3·34 (95% CI 3·28–3·41) for women and 3·36 (3·31–3·41) for men. Alcohol use disorders remained associated with dementia onset for both sexes (adjusted hazard ratios >1·7) in sensitivity analyses on dementia case definition (including Alzheimer's disease) or older study populations. Also, alcohol use disorders were significantly associated with all other risk factors for dementia onset (all p<0·0001).</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Alcohol use disorders were a major risk factor for onset of all types of dementia, and especially early-onset dementia. Thus, screening for heavy drinking should be part of regular medical care, with intervention or treatment being offered when necessary. Additionally, other alcohol policies should be considered to reduce heavy drinking in the general population.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>None.</p>",

		"abstract": "Since vitamin B12 occurs in substantial amounts only in foods derived from animals, vegetarians and particularly vegans are at risk of developing deficiencies of this essential vitamin. The chlorella used for this study is a commercially available whole-food supplement, which is believed to contain the physiologically active form of the vitamin. This exploratory open-label study was performed to determine if adding 9 g of Chlorella pyrenoidosa daily could help mitigate a vitamin B12 deficiency in vegetarians and vegans. Seventeen vegan or vegetarian adults (26–57 years of age) with a known vitamin B12 deficiency, as evidenced by a baseline serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) level above 270 nmol/L at screening, but who otherwise appeared healthy were enrolled in the study. Each participant added 9 g of C. pyrenoidosa to their daily diet for 60 ± 5 days and their serum MMA, vitamin B12, homocysteine (Hcy) levels as well as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin (Hgb), and hematocrit (Hct) were measured at 30 and 60 days from baseline. After 30 and 60 days, the serum MMA level fell significantly (P < .05) by an average ∼34%. Fifteen of the 17 (88%) subjects showed at least a 10% drop in MMA. At the same time, Hcy trended downward and serum vitamin B12 trended upward, while MCV, Hgb, and Hct appeared unchanged. The results of this work suggest that the vitamin B12 in chlorella is bioavailable and such dietary supplementation is a natural way for vegetarians and vegans to get the vitamin B12 they need.",

		"abstract": "Long-chain (LC) omega-3 PUFA derived from marine sources may play an important role in cognitive performance throughout all life stages. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the dominant omega-3 in the brain, is a major component of neuronal cell membranes and affects various neurological pathways and processess. Despite its critical role in brain function, human’s capacity to synthesize DHA de novo is limited and its consumption through the diet is important. However, many individuals do not or rarely consume seafood. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the current evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) in healthy school-aged children, younger and older adults to determine whether consumption of LC omega-3 PUFA improves cognitive performance and to make recommendations for future research. Current evidence suggests that consumption of LC omega-3 PUFA, particularly DHA, may enhance cognitive performance relating to learning, cognitive development, memory and speed of performing cognitive tasks. Those who habitually consume diets low in DHA, children with low literacy ability and malnourished and older adults with age-related cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment seem to benefit most. However, study design limitations in many RCTs hamper firm conclusions. The measurement of a uniform biomarker, e.g., % DHA in red blood cells, is essential to establish baseline DHA-status, to determine targets for cognitive performance and to facilitate dosage recommendations. It is recommended that future studies be at least  16 weeks in duration, account for potential interaction effects of gender, age and apolipoprotein E genotype, include vegan/vegetarian populations, include measures of speed of cognitive performance and include brain imaging technologies as supportive information on working mechanisms of LC omega-3 PUFA.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vegan and vegetarian diets could overcome many diseases of civilization. This study examines whether a whole food vegan diet with Nori algae and wild mushrooms can provide a sufficient quantity of critical nutrients.\nMETHODS: Five blood samples (Baseline to Time 5) were taken over eight months from 75 subjects (10 vegans without B12 supplementation who consumed Nori algae and wild mushrooms, 20 vegans with supplementation, 40 vegetarians, 5 meat-eaters). Blood was analyzed for blood cell counts, total vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, vitamin B6, folic acid, ferritin, TSH, zinc, creatinine, vitamin D2 and D3.\nRESULTS: In the vegan group without supplementation, all means were within the tolerance (holotranscobalamin, homocystein) or normal, except for elevated methylmalonic acid and diminished vitamin D. This group developed significantly higher vitamin D2 levels. The vegan group with B12 supplementation and the vegetarian group showed normal values for all parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Vegans following a whole food diet had a borderline supply of vitamin B12. Folic acid, vitamin B6, TSH, iron metabolism, and the blood count were in the normal range. Vegans taking dietary supplements demonstrated satisfactory overall results. An ingestion of sundried mushrooms can contribute to the supply of vitamin D.",

The aim of this study was to assess the intake and status of selected vitamins and minerals among vegetarian and vegan adults living in Switzerland.MethodsHealthy adults [omnivores (OVs), n OV = 100; vegetarians (VGs), n VG = 53; vegans (VNs), n VN = 53] aged 18–50 years were recruited, and their weight and height were measured. Plasma concentrations of the vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2, B6, B12, folic acid, pantothenic acid, niacin, biotin and β-carotene and of the minerals Fe, Mg and Zn and urinary iodine concentration were determined. Dietary intake was assessed using a three-day weighed food record, and questionnaires were issued in order to assess the physical activity and lifestyle of the subjects.ResultsOmnivores had the lowest intake of Mg, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin and folic acid. Vegans reported low intakes of Ca and a marginal consumption of the vitamins D and B12. The highest prevalence for vitamin and mineral deficiencies in each group was as follows: in the omnivorous group, for folic acid (58 %); in the vegetarian group, for vitamin B6 and niacin (58 and 34 %, respectively); and in the vegan group, for Zn (47 %). Despite negligible dietary vitamin B12 intake in the vegan group, deficiency of this particular vitamin was low in all groups thanks to widespread use of supplements. Prevalence of Fe deficiency was comparable across all diet groups.ConclusionsDespite substantial differences in intake and deficiency between groups, our results indicate that by consuming a well-balanced diet including supplements or fortified products, all three types of diet can potentially fulfill requirements for vitamin and mineral consumption.",

However, few studies have investigated the nutritional status of vegans, who may be at risk of nutritional deficiencies.\n\nObjective\nTo compare dietary intake and nutritional status of Finnish long-term vegans and non-vegetarians.\n\nMethods\nDietary intake and supplement use were estimated using three-day dietary records. Nutritional status was assessed by measuring biomarkers in plasma, serum, and urine samples. Vegans’ (n = 22) data was compared with those of sex- and age-matched non-vegetarians (n = 19).\n\nResults\nAll vegans adhered strictly to their diet; however, individual variability was marked in food consumption and supplementation habits. Dietary intakes of key nutrients, vitamins B12 and D, were lower (P < 0.001) in vegans than in non-vegetarians. Nutritional biomarker measurements showed lower concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), iodine and selenium (corrected for multiple comparisons, P < 0.001), Vegans showed more favorable fatty acid profiles (P < 0.001) as well as much higher concentrations of polyphenols such as genistein and daidzein (P < 0.001). Eicosapentaenoic acid proportions in vegans were higher than expected. The median concentration of iodine in urine was below the recommended levels in both groups.\n\nConclusions\nLong-term consumption of a vegan diet was associated with some favorable laboratory measures but also with lowered concentrations of key nutrients compared to reference values.

In vegetarians, we investigated the association between TMAO concentrations and the strictness of the diet or sex. We also studied the biological variations of TMAO in vegans.MethodsConcentrations of plasma TMAO and choline metabolites were measured in 38 vegans and 67 lacto-ovo-vegetarians (group 1: mean age ± SD = 50 ± 15 years). Group 2 consisted of 66 vegans (29.2 ± 7.3 years) that was tested twice within 3 months of intervention with vitamin B12 or a placebo.ResultsIn group 1, plasma TMAO did not differ according to the strictness of the diet (both means 3.7 µmol/L). In lacto-ovo-vegetarians, men had higher TMAO and betaine, but lower trimethylamine than women. In group 2, the intervention with vitamin B12 had no effect on plasma TMAO or choline metabolites. The mean within-subject change of TMAO within 3 months was −0.3 (95 % confidence intervals = −0.7–0.1 µmol/L). TMAO increased after 3 months (mean 1.7 to 2.8 µmol/L) in vegans with a lower baseline dimethylglycine (2.2 µmol/L), while it declined (from 2.7 to 1.9 µmol/L) in vegans with a higher dimethylglycine (3.1 µmol/L). The intra-class correlation coefficients were 0.819 for TMAO, 0.885 for betaine and 0.860 for dimethylglycine.ConclusionsPlasma TMAO was not related to the strictness of the vegetarian diet. Metabolisms of TMAO and dimethylglycine are interrelated. Intra-individual variations of TMAO are low in vegans. Changes of fasting plasma TMAO >80 % upon retesting are likely to exceed the biological variations.",

		"abstract": "Background: Elevated plasma concentrations of the gut bacteria choline metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are associated with atherosclerosis. However, the determinants of TMAO in humans require additional assessment.Objective: We examined cardiometabolic risk factors and pathways associated with TMAO concentrations in humans.Design: A total of 283 individuals (mean ± SD age: 66.7 ± 9.0 y) were included in this observational study. Plasma concentrations of trimethylamine, TMAO, choline, lipids, phospholipids, and methyl metabolites were measured.Results: Study participants were divided into 4 groups by median concentrations of TMAO and choline (4.36 and 9.7 μmol/L, respectively). Compared with the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were less than the median (n = 82), the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were at least the median (n = 83) was older and had lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, phospholipids, and methylation potential, higher creatinine, betaine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and higher percentages of men and subjects with diabetes. The difference in plasma TMAO concentrations between men and women (7.3 ± 10.0 compared with 5.4 ± 5.6 μmol/L, respectively) was NS after adjustment for age and creatinine (P = 0.455). The TMAO:trimethylamine ratio was higher in men (P &lt; 0.001). Diabetes was associated with significantly higher plasma TMAO concentration (8.6 ± 12.2 compared with 5.4 ± 5.2 μmol/L) even after adjustments. Sex and diabetes showed an interactive effect on trimethylamine concentrations (P = 0.010) but not on TMAO concentrations (P = 0.950). Positive determinants of TMAO in a stepwise regression model that applied to the whole group were SAH, trimethylamine, choline, and female sex, whereas plasma phosphatidylcholine was a negative determinant.Conclusions: High TMAO and choline concentrations are associated with an advanced cardiometabolic risk profile. Diabetes is related to higher plasma TMAO concentrations but also to alterations in interrelated pathways such as lipids, phospholipids, and methylation. Elevated plasma TMAO concentrations likely reflect a specific metabolic pattern characterized by low HDL and phospholipids in addition to hypomethylation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02586181 and NCT02588898.",

Twenty-seven participants received 1200 IU vitamin D3 and 800 mg calcium, and 25 participants received additionally 0.5 mg folic acid, 50 mg B6, and 0.5 mg B12 for 1 year. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy), TMAO, and choline metabolites were measured at baseline and 12 months later. TMAO declined in the vitamin D arm by 0.5 versus 2.8 μmol/L in the D + B arm (p = 0.005). Hcy decreased and betaine increased in the D + B compared to the D arm. Within-subject levels of plasma choline and dimethylglycine and urine betaine increased in both arms and changes did not differ between the arms. TMAO reduction was predicted by higher baseline TMAO and lowering Hcy in stepwise regression analysis. The test–retest variations of TMAO were greater in the D + B arm compared to vitamin D arm.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nB vitamins plus vitamin D lowered plasma fasting TMAO compared to vitamin D. Vitamin D caused alterations in choline metabolism, which may reflect the metabolic flexibility of C1-metabolism. The molecular mechanisms and health implications of these changes are currently unknown.",

		"abstract": "Increased consumption of plant products is associated with lower chronic disease prevalence. This is attributed to the great diversity of healthy phytochemicals present in these foods. The most investigated physiological effects have been their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic properties. Although less studied in humans, some compounds were very early on shown to be lipotropic in animals, i.e., the capacity to hasten the removal of fat from liver and/or reduce hepatic lipid synthesis or deposits by mainly increasing phospholipid synthesis via the transmethylation pathway for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein exportation from the liver and enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and/or down- and up-regulation of genes involved in lipogenic and fatty acid oxidation enzyme synthesis, respectively. The main plant lipotropes are choline, betaine, myo-inositol, methionine, and carnitine. Magnesium, niacin, pantothenate, and folates also indirectly support the overall lipotropic effect. The exhaustive review of rat studies investigating phytochemical effect on hepatic lipid metabolism suggests that some fatty acids, acetic acid, melatonin, phytic acid, some fiber compounds, oligofructose, resistant starch, some phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans, stilbenes, curcumin, saponins, coumarin, some plant extracts, and some solid foods may be lipotropic. However, this remains to be confirmed in humans, for whom intervention studies are practically non-existent. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

		"abstract": "Despite the accepted health benefits of consuming dietary fiber, little is known about the mechanisms by which fiber deprivation impacts the gut microbiota and alters disease risk. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary fiber, the gut microbiota and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or intermittent dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier. Dietary fiber deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived, mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics., \n, Regular consumption of dietary fiber helps prevent erosion of the intestinal mucus barrier by the gut microbiome, blunting pathogen infection and reducing the incidence of colitis.",

		"abstract": "Even though there are many factors that determine the human colon microbiota composition, diet is an important one because most microorganisms in the colon obtain energy for their growth by degrading complex dietary compounds, particularly dietary fibers. While fiber carbohydrates that escape digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract are recognized to have a range of structures, the vastness in number of chemical structures from the perspective of the bacteria is not well appreciated. In this article, we introduce the concept of “discrete structure” that is defined as a unique chemical structure, often within a fiber molecule, which aligns with encoded gene clusters in bacterial genomes. The multitude of discrete structures originates from the array of different fiber types coupled with structural variations within types due to genotype and growing environment, anatomical parts of the grain or plant, discrete regions within polymers, and size of oligosaccharides and small polysaccharides. These thousands of discrete structures conceivably could be used to favor bacteria in the competitive colon environment. A global framework needs to be developed to better understand how dietary fibers can be used to obtain predicted changes in microbiota composition for improved health. This will require a multi-disciplinary effort that includes biological scientists, clinicians, and carbohydrate specialists.",

		"abstract": "One of the most exciting and open research frontiers in neuroscience is that of seeking to understand the functional roles of the layers of cerebral cortex. New experimental techniques for probing the laminar circuitry of cortex have recently been developed, opening up novel opportunities for investigating how its six-layered architecture contributes to perception and cognition. The task of trying to interpret this complex structure can be facilitated by theoretical analyses of the types of computations that cortex is carrying out, and of how these might be implemented in specific cortical circuits. We have recently developed a detailed neural model of how the parvocellular stream of the visual cortex utilizes its feedforward, feedback and horizontal interactions for purposes of visual filtering, attention and perceptual grouping. This model, called LAMINART, shows how these perceptual processes relate to the mechanisms that ensure the stable development of cortical circuits in the infant, and to the continued stability of learning in the adult. The present article reviews this laminar theory of visual cortex, considers how it may be generalized towards a more comprehensive theory that encompasses other cortical areas and cognitive processes, and shows how its laminar framework generates a variety of testable predictions.",

Whether high-intensity interval training (HIT), referring to alternating short bouts of very intense anaerobic exercise with recovery periods, or anaerobic resistance training (RT) has similar effects on AHN is unclear. In addition, individual genetic variation in the overall response to physical exercise is likely to play a part in the effects of exercise on AHN but is less well studied. Recently, we developed polygenic rat models that gain differentially for running capacity in response to aerobic treadmill training. Here, we subjected these low-response trainer (LRT) and high-response trainer (HRT) adult male rats to various forms of physical exercise for 6–8 weeks and examined the effects on AHN. Compared with sedentary animals, the highest number of doublecortin-positive hippocampal cells was observed in HRT rats that ran voluntarily on a running wheel, whereas HIT on the treadmill had a smaller, statistically non-significant effect on AHN. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was elevated in both LRT and HRT rats that underwent endurance training on a treadmill compared with those that performed RT by climbing a vertical ladder with weights, despite their significant gain in strength. Furthermore, RT had no effect on proliferation (Ki67), maturation (doublecortin) or survival (bromodeoxyuridine) of new adult-born hippocampal neurons in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. Our results suggest that physical exercise promotes AHN most effectively if the exercise is aerobic and sustained, especially when accompanied by a heightened genetic predisposition for response to physical exercise.",

		"container-title": "Neural Networks",
		"page": "38-95",
		"volume": "87",
		"source": "ScienceDirect",
		"abstract": "The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how we experience qualia or phenomenal experiences, such as seeing, hearing, and feeling, and knowing what they are. To solve this problem, a theory of consciousness needs to link brain to mind by modeling how emergent properties of several brain mechanisms interacting together embody detailed properties of individual conscious psychological experiences. This article summarizes evidence that Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, accomplishes this goal. ART is a cognitive and neural theory of how advanced brains autonomously learn to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. ART has predicted that “all conscious states are resonant states” as part of its specification of mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. It hereby provides functional and mechanistic explanations of data ranging from individual spikes and their synchronization to the dynamics of conscious perceptual, cognitive, and cognitive–emotional experiences. ART has reached sufficient maturity to begin classifying the brain resonances that support conscious experiences of seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing. Psychological and neurobiological data in both normal individuals and clinical patients are clarified by this classification. This analysis also explains why not all resonances become conscious, and why not all brain dynamics are resonant. The global organization of the brain into computationally complementary cortical processing streams (complementary computing), and the organization of the cerebral cortex into characteristic layers of cells (laminar computing), figure prominently in these explanations of conscious and unconscious processes. Alternative models of consciousness are also discussed.",

		"container-title": "Frontiers in Psychology",
		"volume": "6",
		"source": "Frontiers",
		"abstract": "The FACADE model, and its laminar cortical realization and extension in the 3D LAMINART model, have explained, simulated, and predicted many perceptual and neurobiological data about how the visual cortex carries out 3D vision and figure-ground perception, and how these cortical mechanisms enable 2D pictures to generate 3D percepts of occluding and occluded objects. In particular, these models have proposed how border ownership occurs, but have not yet explicitly explained the correlation between multiple properties of border ownership neurons in cortical area V2 that were reported in a remarkable series of neurophysiological experiments by von der Heydt and his colleagues; namely, border ownership, contrast preference, binocular stereoscopic information, selectivity for side-of-figure, Gestalt rules, and strength of attentional modulation, as well as the time course during which such properties arise. This article shows how, by combining 3D LAMINART properties that were discovered in two parallel streams of research, a unified explanation of these properties emerges. This explanation proposes, moreover, how these properties contribute to the generation of consciously seen 3D surfaces. The first research stream models how processes like 3D boundary grouping and surface filling-in interact in multiple stages within and between the V1 interblob – V2 interstripe – V4 cortical stream and the V1 blob – V2 thin stripe – V4 cortical stream, respectively. Of particular importance for understanding figure-ground separation is how these cortical interactions convert computationally complementary boundary and surface mechanisms into a consistent conscious percept, including the critical use of surface contour feedback signals from surface representations in V2 thin stripes to boundary representations in V2 interstripes. Remarkably, key figure-ground properties emerge from these feedback interactions. The second research stream shows how cells that compute absolute disparity in",

		"abstract": "A laminar cortical model of stereopsis and later stages of 3D surface perception is developed and simulated. The model describes how initial stages of monocular and binocular oriented filtering interact with later stages of 3D boundary formation and surface filling-in in the lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical areas V1, V2, and V4. In particular, it details how interactions between layers 4, 3B, and 2/3A in V1 and V2 contribute to stereopsis, and clarifies how binocular and monocular information combine to form 3D boundary and surface representations. Along the way, the model modifies and significantly extends the disparity energy model. Neural explanations are given for psychophysical data concerning: contrast variations of dichoptic masking and the correspondence problem, the effect of interocular contrast differences on stereoacuity, Panum’s limiting case, the Venetian blind illusion, stereopsis with polarity-reversed stereograms, da Vinci stereopsis, and various lightness illusions. By relating physiology to psychophysics, the model provides new functional insights and predictions about laminar cortical architecture.",

		"genre": "Technical Report",
		"source": "open.bu.edu",
		"abstract": "A detailed neural model is presented of how the laminar circuits of visual cortical areas V1 and V2 implement context-sensitive binding processes such as perceptual grouping and attention. The model proposes how specific laminar circuits allow the responses of visual cortical neurons to be determined not only by the stimuli within their classical receptive fields, but also to be strongly influenced by stimuli in the extra-classical surround. This context-sensitive visual processing can greatly enhance the analysis of visual scenes, especially those containing targets that are low contrast, partially occluded, or crowded by distractors. We show how interactions of feedforward, feedback and horizontal circuitry can implement several types of contextual processing simultaneously, using shared laminar circuits. In particular, we present computer simulations which suggest how top-down attention and preattentive perceptual grouping, two processes that are fundamental for visual binding, can interact, with attentional enhancement selectively propagating along groupings of both real and illusory contours, thereby showing how attention can selectively enhance object representations. These simulations also illustrate how attention may have a stronger facilitatory effect on low contrast than on high contrast stimuli, and how pop-out from orientation contrast may occur. The specific functional roles which the model proposes for the cortical layers allow several testable neurophysiological predictions to be made. The results presented here simulate only the boundary grouping system of adult cortical architecture. However we also discuss how this model contributes to a larger neural theory of vision which suggests how intracortical and intercortical feedback help to stabilize development and learning within these cortical circuits. Although feedback plays a key role, fast feedforward processing is possible in response to unambiguous information. Model circuits are capable of synchronizing quickly, but context-sensitive persistence of previous events can influence how synchrony develops. Although these results focus on how the interblob cortical processing stream controls boundary grouping and attention, related modeling of the blob cortical processing stream suggests how visible surfaces are formed, and modeling of the motion stream suggests how transient responses to scenic changes can control long-range apparent motion and also attract spatial attention.",

		"abstract": "In the past, different types of diet with a generally low-carbohydrate content (< 50–< 20 g/day) have been promoted, for weight loss and diabetes, and the effectiveness of a very low dietary carbohydrate content has always been a matter of debate. A significant reduction in the amount of carbohydrates in the diet is usually accompanied by an increase in the amount of fat and to a lesser extent, also protein. Accordingly, using the term “low carb–high fat” (LCHF) diet is most appropriate. Low/very low intakes of carbohydrate food sources may impact on overall diet quality and long-term effects of such drastic diet changes remain at present unknown. This narrative review highlights recent metabolic and clinical outcomes of studies as well as practical feasibility of low LCHF diets. A few relevant observations are as follows: (1) any diet type resulting in reduced energy intake will result in weight loss and related favorable metabolic and functional changes; (2) short-term LCHF studies show both favorable and less desirable effects; (3) sustained adherence to a ketogenic LCHF diet appears to be difficult. A non-ketogenic diet supplying 100–150 g carbohydrate/day, under good control, may be more practical. (4) There is lack of data supporting long-term efficacy, safety and health benefits of LCHF diets. Any recommendation should be judged in this light. (5) Lifestyle intervention in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while maintaining a relative carbohydrate-rich diet, results in long-term prevention of progression to type 2 diabetes and is generally seen as safe.",

Due to the variation of its nutritional traits and biochemical specificities, starch has been classified into rapidly digestible, slowly digestible and resistant starch. Resistant starch has its own unique chemical structure, and various forms of resistant starch are commercially available. It has been found being a multiple-functional regulator for treating metabolic dysfunction. Different functions of resistant starch such as modulation of the gut microbiota, gut peptides, circulating growth factors, circulating inflammatory mediators have been characterized by animal studies and clinical trials. In this mini-review, recent remarkable progress in resistant starch on gut microbiota, particularly the effect of structure, biochemistry and cell signaling on nutrition has been summarized, with highlights on its regulatory effect on gut microbiota.",

		"abstract": "A few commonly used non-antibiotic drugs have recently been associated with changes in gut microbiome composition, but the extent of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we screened more than 1,000 marketed drugs against 40 representative gut bacterial strains, and found that 24% of the drugs with human targets, including members of all therapeutic classes, inhibited the growth of at least one strain in vitro. Particular classes, such as the chemically diverse antipsychotics, were overrepresented in this group. The effects of human-targeted drugs on gut bacteria are reflected on their antibiotic-like side effects in humans and are concordant with existing human cohort studies. Susceptibility to antibiotics and human-targeted drugs correlates across bacterial species, suggesting common resistance mechanisms, which we verified for some drugs. The potential risk of non-antibiotics promoting antibiotic resistance warrants further exploration. Our results provide a resource for future research on drug–microbiome interactions, opening new paths for side effect control and drug repurposing, and broadening our view of antibiotic resistance.",

		"abstract": "This study examined the combined effects of aerobic exercise intensity and duration on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (sBDNF) levels in healthy human adult males aged 18-25 years. Forty five participants were randomly assigned to one of six exercise conditions based on varying intensity (80% or 60% of heart rate reserve, or control) and duration (20 or 40 min). Vigorous (80% heart rate reserve, “Vig”) and moderate (60% heart rate reserve, “Mod”) exercise was carried out on cycle ergometers. Control subjects remained seated and at rest during the exercise period. Pre- and post-exercise blood draws were conducted and sBDNF measured. Physical exercise caused an average ~ 32% increase in sBDNF levels relative to baseline that resulted in concentrations that were 45% higher than control conditions. Comparing the six conditions, sBDNF levels rose consistently among the four exercise conditions (Vig20 = 26.38 ± 34.89%, Vig40 = 28.48 ± 19.11%, Mod20 = 41.23 ± 59.65%, Mod40 = 30.16 ± 72.11%) and decreased consistently among the controls (Con20 = -14.48 ± 16.50, Con40 = -10.51 ± 26.78). Vig conditions had the highest proportion of subjects that experienced a significant (? 10%) increase in sBDNF levels, followed by Mod and control conditions. An analysis of modeled sBDNF integrals (area under the curve) demonstrated substantially greater values for Vig40 and Mod40 conditions compared to Vig20 and Mod20 conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that neither duration (20 vs. 40 min) nor intensity (60 vs. 80% HR reserve) significantly affects the benefits of exercise if only the sBDNF increase at a single post-exercise time point is considered. However, when comparing either the probability of achieving a significant BDNF gain or the integral (i.e. the volume of circulating BDNF over time) the Vig40 condition offers maximal benefits. Thus, we conclude that the future study of aerobic exercise effects on BDNF-mediated neuroprotection should take the volume of BDNF release over time into account., \n          \n            \n              Key Points\n            \n            \n              \n                Aerobic exercise caused a ~32% increase in serum BDNF in adult human males while serum BDNF decreased 13% in sedentary control subjects.\n              \n              \n                Vigorous intensity (80% heart rate reserve), long duration (40 min) exercise offered the greatest probability of a significant BDNF elevation.\n              \n              \n                Long duration exercise offered the greatest numerical benefits in terms of BDNF integral.\n              \n              \n                Neither intensity nor duration affected the mean elevation in BDNF amplitude caused by exercise.",

		"abstract": "Abstract It has been hypothesized that one mechanism through which physical activity provides benefits to cognition and mood is via increasing brain?derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. Some studies have reported immediate benefits to mood and various cognitive domains after a single session of exercise. This meta?analysis sought to determine the effect of a single exercise session on concentrations of BDNF in peripheral blood, in order to evaluate the potential role of BDNF in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Rehabilitation & Sports Medicine Source, and CINAHL databases were searched for original, peer?reviewed reports of peripheral blood BDNF concentrations before and after acute exercise interventions. Risk of bias within studies was assessed using standardized criteria. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were generated from random effects models. Risk of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored in subgroup analyses. In 55 studies that met inclusion criteria, concentrations of peripheral blood BDNF were higher after exercise (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46?0.72, P < 0.001). In meta?regression analysis, greater duration of exercise was associated with greater increases in BDNF. Subgroup analyses revealed an effect in males but not in females, and a greater BDNF increase in plasma than serum. Acute exercise increased BDNF concentrations in the peripheral blood of healthy adults. This effect was influenced by exercise duration and may be different across genders.",

However, it can be considered that energy restriction and stressful challenge induced by long-lasting physical exercise might cause direct effect on brain function.

		"abstract": "During development of the nervous system, the formation of connections (synapses) between neurons is dependent upon electrical activity in those neurons, and neurotrophic factors produced by target cells play a pivotal role in such activity-dependent sculpting of the neural networks. A similar interplay between neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor signaling pathways mediates adaptive responses of neural networks to environmental demands in adult mammals, with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) being particularly prominent regulators of synaptic plasticity throughout the central nervous system. Optimal brain health throughout the lifespan is promoted by intermittent challenges such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and dietary energy restriction, that subject neurons to activity-related metabolic stress. At the molecular level, such challenges to neurons result in the production of proteins involved in neurogenesis, learning and memory and neuronal survival; examples include proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, protein quality control, and resistance of cells to oxidative, metabolic and proteotoxic stress. BDNF signaling mediates up-regulation of several such proteins including the protein chaperone GRP-78, antioxidant enzymes, the cell survival protein Bcl-2, and the DNA repair enzyme APE1. Insufficient exposure to such challenges, genetic factors may conspire to impair BDNF production and/or signaling resulting in the vulnerability of the brain to injury and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases. Further, BDNF signaling is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids impair synaptic plasticity in the brain by negatively regulating spine density, neurogenesis and long-term potentiation, effects that are potentially linked to glucocorticoid regulation of BDNF. Findings suggest that BDNF signaling in specific brain regions mediates some of the beneficial effects of exercise and energy restriction on peripheral energy metabolism and the cardiovascular system. Collectively, the findings described in this article suggest the possibility of developing prescriptions for optimal brain health based on activity-dependent BDNF signaling.",

		"abstract": "Exercise is known to induce a cascade of molecular and cellular processes that support brain plasticity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an essential neurotrophin that is also intimately connected with central and peripheral molecular processes of energy metabolism and homeostasis, and could play a crucial role in these induced mechanisms.This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of acute exercise and/or training on BDNF in healthy subjects and in persons with a chronic disease or disability. A systematic and critical literature search was conducted. Articles were considered for inclusion in the review if they were human studies, assessed peripheral (serum and/or plasma) BDNF and evaluated an acute exercise or training intervention. Nine RCTs, one randomized trial, five non-randomized controlled trials, five non-randomized non-controlled trials and four retrospective observational studies were analysed. Sixty-nine percent of the studies in healthy subjects and 86%of the studies in persons with a chronic disease or disability, showed a ‘mostly transient’ increase in serum or plasma BDNF concentration following an acute aerobic exercise. The two studies regarding a single acute strength exercise session could not show a significant influence on basal BDNF concentration. In studies regarding the effects of strength or aerobic training on BDNF, a difference should be made between effects on basal BDNF concentration and training-induced effects on the BDNF response following an acute exercise. Only three out of ten studies on aerobic or strength training (i.e. 30%) found a training-induced increase in basal BDNF concentration. Two out of six studies (i.e. 33%) reported a significantly higher BDNF response to acute exercise following an aerobic or strength training programme (i.e. compared with the BDNF response to an acute exercise at baseline). A few studies of low quality (i.e. retrospective observational studies) show that untrained or moderately trained healthy subjects have higher basal BDNF concentrations than highly trained subjects. Yet, strong evidence still has to come from good methodological studies.Available results suggest that acute aerobic, but not strength exercise increases basal peripheral BDNF concentrations, although the effect is transient. From a few studies we learn that circulating BDNF originates both from central and peripheral sources. We can only speculate which central regions and peripheral sources in particular circulating BDNF originates from, where it is transported to and to what purpose it is used and/or stored at its final destination. No study could show a long-lasting BDNF response to acute exercise or training (i.e. permanently increased basal peripheral BDNF concentration) in healthy subjects or persons with a chronic disease or disability. It seems that exercise and/or training temporarily elevate basal BDNF and possibly upregulate cellular processing of BDNF (i.e. synthesis, release, absorption and degradation). From that point of view, exercise and/or training would result in a higher BDNF synthesis following an acute exercise bout (i.e. compared with untrained subjects). Subsequently, more BDNF could be released into the blood circulation which may, in turn, be absorbed more efficiently by central and/or peripheral tissues where it could induce a cascade of neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects.",

Experimental and observational studies were identified from PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and SPORT Discus. A total of 32 articles met the inclusion criteria. Evidence from experimental studies suggested that peripheral BDNF concentrations were elevated by acute and chronic aerobic exercise. The majority of the studies suggested that strength training had no influence on peripheral BDNF.

		"abstract": "An important concept in neurobiology is “neurons that fire together, wire together” which means that the formation and maintenance of synapses is promoted by activation of those synapses. Very similar to the effects of the stress of exercise on muscle cells, emerging findings suggest that neurons respond to activity by activating signaling pathways (e.g., Ca2+, CREB, PGC-1α, NF-κB) that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular stress resistance. These pathways are also activated by aerobic exercise and food deprivation, two bioenergetic challenges of fundamental importance in the evolution of the brains of all mammals, including humans. The metabolic ‘switch’ in fuel source from liver glycogen store-derived glucose to adipose cell-derived fatty acids and their ketone metabolites during fasting and sustained exercise, appears to be a pivotal trigger of both brain-intrinsic and peripheral organ-derived signals that enhance learning and memory and underlying synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Brain-intrinsic extracellular signals include the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the neurotrophic factor BDNF, and peripheral signals may include the liver-derived ketone 3-hydroxybutyrate and the muscle cell-derived protein irisin. Emerging findings suggest that fasting, exercise and an intellectually challenging lifestyle can protect neurons against the dysfunction and degeneration that they would otherwise suffer in acute brain injuries (stroke and head trauma) and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease. Among the prominent intracellular responses of neurons to these bioenergetic challenges are up-regulation of antioxidant defenses, autophagy/mitophagy and DNA repair. A better understanding of such fundamental hormesis-based adaptive neuronal response mechanisms is expected to result in the development and implementation of novel interventions to promote optimal brain function and healthy brain aging.",

		"abstract": "During prolonged resistance training, protein supplementation is known to promote morphological changes; however, no previous training studies have tested the effect of insect protein isolate in a human trial. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of insect protein as a dietary supplement to increase muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during prolonged resistance training in young men. Eighteen healthy young men performed resistance training four day/week for eight weeks. Subjects were block randomized into two groups consuming either an insect protein isolate or isocaloric carbohydrate supplementation within 1 h after training and pre-sleep on training days. Strength and body composition were measured before and after intervention to detect adaptions to the resistance training. Three-day weighed dietary records were completed before and during intervention. Fat- and bone- free mass (FBFM) improved significantly in both groups (Mean (95% confidence interval (CI))), control group (Con): (2.5 kg (1.5, 3.5) p &lt; 0.01), protein group (Pro): (2.7 kg (1.6, 3.8) p &lt; 0.01) from pre- to post-. Leg and bench press one repetition maximum (1 RM) improved by Con: (42.0 kg (32.0, 52.0) p &lt; 0.01) and (13.8 kg (10.3, 17.2) p &lt; 0.01), Pro: (36.6 kg (27.3, 45.8) p &lt; 0.01) and (8.1 kg (4.5, 11.8) p &lt; 0.01), respectively. No significant differences in body composition and muscle strength improvements were found between groups. In young healthy men, insect protein supplementation did not improve adaptations to eight weeks of resistance training in comparison to carbohydrate supplementation. A high habitual protein intake in both Con and Pro may partly explain our observation of no superior effect of insect protein supplementation.",

For the approximately 100 known tumour types of the central nervous system, standardization of the diagnostic process has been shown to be particularly challenging—with substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many tumour types. Here we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours across all entities and age groups, and demonstrate its application in a routine diagnostic setting. We show that the availability of this method may have a substantial impact on diagnostic precision compared to standard methods, resulting in a change of diagnosis in up to 12% of prospective cases. For broader accessibility, we have designed a free online classifier tool, the use of which does not require any additional onsite data processing. Our results provide a blueprint for the generation of machine-learning-based tumour classifiers across other cancer entities, with the potential to fundamentally transform tumour pathology.",

		"abstract": "Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring cancer chemopreventive, is the hydrolysis product of glucoraphanin, the main glucosinolate in broccoli. The hydrolysis requires myrosinase isoenzyme to be present in sufficient activity; however, processing leads to its denaturation and hence reduced hydrolysis. In this study, the effect of adding mustard seeds, which contain a more resilient isoform of myrosinase, to processed broccoli was investigated with a view to intensify the formation of sulforaphane. Thermal inactivation of myrosinase from both broccoli and mustard seeds was studied. Thermal degradation of broccoli glucoraphanin was investigated in addition to the effects of thermal processing on the formation of sulforaphane and sulforaphane nitrile. Limited thermal degradation of glucoraphanin (less than 12%) was observed when broccoli was placed in vacuum sealed bag (sous vide) and cooked in a water bath at 100°C for 8 and 12min. Boiling broccoli in water prevented the formation of any significant levels of sulforaphane due to inactivated myrosinase. However, addition of powdered mustard seeds to the heat processed broccoli significantly increased the formation of sulforaphane.",

The results showed that glucoerucin, glucobrassicin, and 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin in 7-d-old broccoli sprouts were significantly enhanced and the activity of myrosinase was inhibited by 100 mmol/L of NaCl. However, the total glucosinolate content in 7-d-old broccoli sprouts was markedly decreased although the fresh weight was significantly increased after treatment with NaCl at relatively low concentrations (20, 40, and 60 mmol/L). NaCl treatment at the concentration of 60 mmol/L for 5 d maintained higher biomass and comparatively higher content of glucosinolates in sprouts of broccoli with decreased myrosinase activity. A relatively high level of NaCl treatment (100 mmol/L) significantly increased the content of sulforaphane in 7-d-old broccoli sprouts compared with the control. These results indicate that broccoli sprouts grown under a suitable concentration of NaCl could be desirable for human nutrition.",

In addition, aniline hydroxylase activity was measured in MA runners and aged swimmers and compared to respective sham and non-handled controls. Treadmill exercise consisted of running aged and MA rats on a motorized treadmill for 16 and 20 m/min respectively, 60 min/day and 4 times per week, for 8 weeks. Sham rats were placed on the treadmill twice per week for 5 mins at 8 m/min. No differences were found in any parameter comparing sham rats to non-handled controls. Running did not affect body weight or hepatic microsomal protein during the 8-week study. A 33–35% decline in microsomal P-450 content in treadmill exercised MA and aged rats was found. PNA O-demethylase activity was decreased 30% in MA and 45% in aged runners and aniline metabolism was inhibited 21% in MA rats. UDPGT activity was not affected by running in MA or aged rats. Swimming exercise was accomplished by placing the rats in a tank of water (32–33°C) filled to a depth of 2 ft. Swim time was 60 min twice daily, 5 times per week. The aged and MA rats were trained for 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Two control groups, non-swimming sedentary (dry control) and 1 min swim/day sham (wet control), were utilized. MA and aged wet controls and swimmers weighed 8% and 15% less respectively, than MA and aged sedentary rats. Microsomal protein was significantly increased in MA swimmers compared to sedentary (20%) and wet control (35%) bu no change was found with swimming in the aged rats. The results of the enzymatic studies were variable in the MA rats. Increases in P-450 content were found in wet controls (16%) and swimmers (27%) of the MA group, but only the swimming change was significant. No significant change was determined for pNA metabolism between swimmers and wet (22%) or dry (17%) controls. Aged swimmers and wet controls were more consistent, with no change in any of the parameters except aniline metabolism which was significantly increased in wet controls (25%) and swimmers (28%) as compared to dry controls. No significant change in UDPGT activity was measured in either age group of swimmers. Thus, while runing resulted in consistent results including an inhibition of P-450 content and activity within and between age groups, swimming results were variable and most changes included the wet control. Therefore, the results of the swimming study appear to be influenced by some components associated with exposuer to the water which may or may not be related to the exercise itself.",

		"abstract": "Physical fitness, as expressed by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), was measured in 14 subjects before and during physical education consisting of 4 to 8 hr of daily physical training. Mean pulse rate during training was 115 bpm. After 3 mo of physical training, VO2max increased a mean 6% (range ?5% to +23%). Corresponding mean increases in hepatic drug metabolism, as expressed by the metabolism of the model drugs antipyrine and aminopyrine, were 12% (range ?12% to +59%) and 13% (range ?21% to +47%). Changes in the two groups were still present 6 mo after physical education. There was only a moderately close but nonetheless significant correlation (r =0.7) between the extent of change in VO2max and the corresponding relative change in antipyrine metabolism during the 3?mo period of this investigation. The correlation between oxygen uptake and aminopyrine metabolism (r =0.6) was slightly less and was not significant. Improved physical fitness associated with enhanced drug metabolism may lead to changes in drug efficacy and drug toxicity that may be clinically important in the case of drugs with low therapeutic indices.

		"abstract": "New neurons continue to be generated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus1,2,3,4,5. This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease6,7,8,9,10. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day11, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons12,13,14. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18–77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.",

		"abstract": "The production of NO has been studied by means of arc discharges in the laboratory which simulate natural lightning in current waveform and amplitude (?30 kA). Observations are compared to the results of a computational model that includes the dynamics of energy deposition and channel expansion, combined with the Zel'dovich equations to model the relevant chemical reactions. Results are expressed as NO produced per meter of arc length, and are measured as functions of dissipated energy and of peak current. It is found that at atmospheric pressure, the NO production per joule of dissipated energy is not constant. NO production per meter discharge length as a function of peak current appears to provide a more appropriate scaling factor for estimates of total global NO production. Production of NO2 was less than 10% of the production of NO, and by implication the production of O3 less still. From these data, and using published estimates of global lightning frequency, we derive an estimate of global NO production of 2.5 Tg(N)/yr for 30 flashes per second to 8.3 Tg(N)/yr for 100 flashes per second.",

		"abstract": "A study was conducted to determine the effect of one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (OAUGDP) on inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes on apples, cantaloupe, and lettuce, respectively. A five-strain mixture of cultured test organisms was washed, suspended in phosphate buffer, and spot inoculated onto produce (7 log CFU per sample). Samples were exposed inside a chamber affixed to the OAUGDP blower unit operated at a power of 9 kV and frequency of 6 kHz. This configuration allows the sample to be placed outside of the plasma generation unit while allowing airflow to carry the antimicrobial active species, including ozone and nitric oxide, onto the food sample. Cantaloupe and lettuce samples were exposed for 1, 3, and 5 min, while apple samples were exposed for 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. After exposure, samples were pummeled in 0.1% peptone water–2% Tween 80, diluted, and plated in duplicate onto selective media and tryptic soy agar and incubated as follows: E. coli O157:H7 (modified eosin methylene blue) and Salmonella (xylose lysine tergitol-4) for 48 h at 37°C, and L. monocytogenes (modified Oxford medium) at 48 h for 32°C. E. coli O157: H7 populations were reduced by >1 log after 30-s and 1-min exposures and >2 log after a 2-min exposure. Salmonella populations were reduced by >2 log after 1 min. Three- and 5-min exposure times resulted in >3-log reduction. L. monocytogenes populations were reduced by 1 log after 1 min of exposure. Three- and 5-min exposure times resulted in >3- and >5-log reductions, respectively. This process has the capability of serving as a novel, nonthermal processing technology to be used for reducing microbial populations on produce surfaces.",

		"abstract": "The need for large-area, high-density plasma sources for plasma-aided manufacturing of integrated circuits has created a renewed interest in inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs). Several ICP reactor geometries are briefly reviewed. Typically, inductive coupling of RF power (0.5-28 MHz) can produce ion densities in excess of 10 12 cm -3 even at submillitorr pressures. Existing electromagnetic field models of ICPs are examined and found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results. Sputter deposition, anodic silicon oxidation and polymer etching using ICPs are also described. It is concluded that ICPs are promising candidates for meeting the future requirements of plasma processing, although considerable process development, plasma characterization and modelling are still needed.",

The description of plasma generating devices covers DC plasma torches, DC transferred arcs, RF inductively coupled plasma torches and hybrid combinations of them. Emphasis is given to the identification of the basic energy coupling mechanism in each case and the principal characteristics of the flow and temperature fields in the plasma. Materials processing techniques using thermal plasmas are grouped in two broad categories depending on the role played by the plasma in the process. Only typical examples are given of each type of process. These are grouped under two broad subsections dealing respectively with applications in which the plasma is used as a source of heat in high temperatures, and those in which the plasma is used as a source of chemically active species. The author also deals with plasma diagnostics and mathematical modeling and the role which they can play in the long term development of the technology",

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. * The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.",
