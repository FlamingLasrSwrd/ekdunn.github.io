# Crystalline L-Carnosine Zinc

> In 100 ml of methanol was dissolved 3.51 g of sodium hydroxide followed by addition of 9.96 g of L-carnosine to give a homogeneous solution. Then, a solution prepared by dissolving 9.67 g of zinc acetate dihydrate in 145 ml of methanol was added dropwise to the above solution over a period of 30 minutes with stirring, whereby a white precipitate was formed by degrees. After completion of dropwise addition, the reaction mixture was further stirred for 2 hours and, then, allowed to stand overnight. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with 140 ml of water and dried in the air at 80°C for 5 hours to recover 12.4 g of white crystalline powder. The crystalline powder was subjected to the various analyses described hereinbefore.
>  The present inventors found that when the reaction is conducted using 0.8 to 1.2 moles of a zinc salt and 1.6 to 2.4 moles of an alkali metal compound to each mole of L-carnosine in an anhydrous or hydrous polar organic solvent either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature...
> Thus, the present invention relates to a crystalline L-carnosine zinc complex giving an elemental analysis substantially conforming to the formula C₉H₁₂N₄O₃Zn and a process for producing a crystalline L-carnosine zinc complex which comprises reacting L-carnosine, a zinc salt and an alkali metal compound in an anhydrous or hydrous polar organic solvent.
> The polar organic solvent used in the production of a crystalline L-carnosine zinc complex according to the invention is exemplified by alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc., acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and so on. These solvents may contain up to about 50 percent of water. The alkali metal compound may for example be lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium alkoxide or sodium alkoxide.
