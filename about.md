<!--notes-->
[^1]: This used to be INTP, but I've come out of my shell a bit. Also, Myers-Briggs isn't a very good test anyway.
[^2]: I disagree with the results on agreeableness. I am usually quite trustful, straightforward, altruistic, and modest. I would not consider myself tender-minded. This particular test from [OpenPsychometrics][] had some unusual questions.
