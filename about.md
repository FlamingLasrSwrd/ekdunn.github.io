  The following descriptions are good approximations of my character, but always
  with caveats and made as grandiose as possible.

# Site Title
*Newton's flaming laser sword* is a term coined in 2004 by Mike Alder. In an article in __Philosophy Now__, Alder draws a parallel between the well known *Occam's Razor* and this new cleaving tool. With Occam's razor the search space of possible solutions to a problem or question only the most parsimonious survives. While this is extremely helpful, Newton's flaming laser sword is "much sharper and more dangerous". Put simply, it says that only propositions that can be tested with science should be considered or even discussed.  [@alder_newtons_2004]

<!--notes-->
[^1]: This used to be INTP, but I've come out of my shell a bit. Also, Myers-Briggs isn't a very good test anyway.
[^2]: I disagree with the results on agreeableness. I am usually quite trustful, straightforward, altruistic, and modest. I would not consider myself tender-minded. This particular test from [OpenPsychometrics][] had some unusual questions.
